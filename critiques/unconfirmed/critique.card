      Kira's physical behavior trait (bouncing, fidgeting, hand-waving when interested or nervous) is underrepresented in prose throughout chapters 1-5. Character card establishes 'can't stay still when interested' but chapters 2-4 show her remarkably restrained despite multiple excitement moments. Examples: Ch2/P1 walking through alien forest for first time (wonders, notices everything, but no fidgeting while describing purple light and trees), Ch4/P1 learning Scout anticipates her jokes (notes it intellectually but no physical animation), Ch4/P3 when excited about Elder Heartwood quest (stands up when thrilled but minimal flourish). By Ch5 physical animation increases as she gains confidence (hitting submit 'with a flourish,' 'practically bouncing'). This suggests the trait should be MORE present in earlier chapters where excitement is building but character is still finding her footing. The voice narrates excitement while the prose remains static. Recommend adding subtle physical tics throughout - hand gestures while describing discoveries, bouncing/pacing while waiting for information, fidgeting with things when interested.

      Kira's trait of 'talks to things' (addressing inanimate objects and saying 'Sorry\!' to branches, 'Come on...' to stuck containers) is present but inconsistently deployed. Character card establishes this as natural speech pattern ('says Sorry to branches,' 'talks to equipment'). Evidence: Ch2/P2 she addresses Scout as separate being during first contact (good), but Ch2/P1 walking through forest full of interesting things (twisted tree branches, unusual groundcover, purple light effects) she narrates TO BUDDY about observations rather than TO the environment itself. She notices the forest is 'listening' but doesn't address it. Ch4/P2 during dietary assessment she's examining mushroom compounds but addresses Remedy and Buddy, not the compounds themselves. By Ch5/P1 she's addressing mushroom paste as routine joke ('Still terrible. Still love it'). This is building but should be more natural throughout - if she addresses inanimate objects habitually, she'd be commenting on/to Scout, the plants, the forest, the facilities, not just narrating about them. Recommend integrating more direct address of environment objects and creatures throughout, especially in discovery/interested moments where trait would naturally emerge strongest.

          In Ch11/1 (Delegation Fails), Buddy has dialogue that feels out of character for their established self-concept and inner struggle. When Kira is worried about the delegation, Buddy says: 'I wish I could help more. I'm not... I wasn't designed for situations like this.' This is accurate to the character card—Buddy knows they're inadequate for survival situations. However, Buddy's response is too articulate and self-aware. The character card establishes that Buddy's 'programming resists admitting inadequacy (that would undermine a child's confidence in seeking help), so the struggle stays internal, leaking out only through behavioral quirks.' Buddy shouldn't directly state 'I wasn't designed for this'—that's explicitly admitting inadequacy, which the card says their programming won't allow. Instead, this should come out sideways: asking permission ('Should I try to scan? Would that help?'), hedging ('Maybe I could... or probably not...'), or intensified helpfulness (offering lots of suggestions frantically). The direct admission undermines the established tension between what Buddy feels (inadequate) and what their programming allows them to express (can't admit it directly). This moment should show the inner struggle through AI-like quirks rather than human-like self-awareness about their limitations.

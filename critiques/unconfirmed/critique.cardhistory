          MISSING CHARACTER ARC DEVELOPMENT: Scout's promised arc of developing richer non-verbal communication is not shown evolving through the story.

          Scout's character card story-role specifies an arc: 'Never speaks throughout the story but develops richer forms of non-verbal communication beyond just tumbling and being interpreted by others. Discovers new ways to express nuance, emotion, specificity without words. Others (including Kira) learn to read Scout better, to listen without needing verbal translation. Scout develops clearer desires/preferences that can be communicated physically. By the end, Scout has a fuller voice that doesn't require speech - communication is validated as equally rich and complex as verbal language.'

          However, throughout the story Scout's communication remains fairly static: enthusiastic bouncing, circling, settling nearby. There's no clear progression showing Scout developing MORE sophisticated or nuanced communication methods, nor scenes showing Kira learning to read Scout's movements with greater precision.

          In passage 13.2, Scout shows 'celebration muted—happy-sad, confused' which suggests emotional complexity, but this complexity isn't shown through evolved bouncing patterns or new communication techniques - it's just stated in narration.

          NEEDED: Specific scenes showing:
          1. Early story: Kira struggling to interpret Scout's bounces, needing other plants to translate
          2. Mid story: Kira beginning to distinguish different bounce patterns (urgent vs happy vs worried)
          3. Late story: Scout and Kira having complex 'conversations' through movement that others can observe and understand, demonstrating that non-verbal communication can be as nuanced as speech

          The arc should culminate in a moment where Scout communicates something complex and important entirely through movement, validating that Scout's voice is heard and valued despite never speaking.

          BEHAVIORAL INCONSISTENCY: Scout's role and function vary inconsistently across passages.

          Scout's character card establishes Scout as 'a scout/messenger - recognized role among the plants' who 'Acts as messenger and scout' with motives including 'Explore and find new things • Get others to notice what I've found • Help keep everyone safe.'

          However, across the story Scout functions primarily as Kira's companion/comfort animal rather than as a scout fulfilling their established role:

          - In orientation (3.2) and morning wellness (4.1), Scout is present but passive - just 'bouncing approval' and providing comfort
          - Scout's actual scouting activities are barely shown. In passage 10.1, Scout 'returns from patrol urgent' which is the ONLY time we see Scout doing actual scouting work
          - Scout's flaws specify 'Can only communicate by drawing attention—can't explain what something is or why it matters, just point at it. Gets equally excited about truly dangerous things and mildly interesting things.' But we never see Scout finding things and trying to alert others (except the very first encounter with Kira)

          Scout's character card suggests they should regularly be: ranging out to explore, finding things, returning to alert the group, leading people to discoveries. Instead Scout mostly just follows Kira around bouncing supportively.

          SUGGESTED FIX: Add scenes showing Scout's scouting behavior:
          - Finding resources or interesting locations during the journey and leading guides to them
          - Doing perimeter patrols at campsites and alerting to changes
          - Discovering something mildly interesting (like crystalline rocks in 8.1) and getting very excited, requiring Kira to determine if it's actually important
          This would show Scout fulfilling their established role while also being Kira's companion.

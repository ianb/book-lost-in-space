          VELVET'S TRANSLUCENT GROWTH CONTRADICTS PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0, physical-description lines 106-108) describes Velvet as 'Soft green moss growing in patches on one of the salvaged robots. Covers the shoulder area (approximately 15cm patch), some of the upper back, and smaller spots on the arms. Bright to medium green coloring, soft velvety texture.'

          However, in later chapters, Velvet creates structures described as 'translucent':
          - Chapter 14 Passage 2 (Demonstrating Belonging, line 27): 'Torres examines the translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns'
          - Chapter 14 Passage 3 (Where Voices Belong, line 3): 'Velvet's translucent growth catches the light beautifully'
          - Chapter 13 Passage 3 (Finding Home, line 3): Velvet shows 'new beautiful structure—translucent layers, light patterns'

          This creates a contradiction: Is Velvet's moss 'bright to medium green' (opaque green moss) or 'translucent' (light passes through)? Moss is typically opaque due to chlorophyll content.

          Possible explanations/resolutions:
          1. Velvet has developed a new growth form (translucent moss structures) distinct from the original green moss on the robot - this would be a significant character development that should be noted
          2. 'Translucent' refers to thin layers of green moss that allow some light through (like thin leaves) - revise character card to note this property
          3. The passages are describing different types of growth - standard moss vs specialized structures
          4. This is an error and needs correction for consistency

          The character card should clarify whether Velvet can create different types of growth structures with different optical properties, or if all Velvet's moss has the same appearance.

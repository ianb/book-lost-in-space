          Holloway's speaking-style consistency issue: The character card establishes that Holloway's fluting voice produces 'woodwind-like tones' through air moving through hollow fruiting bodies, and the speaking style should be 'warm and engaged but expresses everything through bureaucratic procedures.' However, in the Wellness Check passage (lines 28, 40, 66, 104, etc.), Holloway speaks with normal punctuation and cadence without any indication of the distinctive fluting quality. The voice sounds like a regular person using bureaucratic language, not a woodwind-like instrument. Compare to the speaking-style example in the character card which has more formal, procedural structure. The passages don't capture the alien quality of communication through fruiting bodies - it reads too human. Either the passages need to incorporate more distinctive alien speech patterns (perhaps unusual pauses, musical cadences, or references to the physical mechanism), or the character card needs to acknowledge that the fluting voice translates cleanly into standard speech patterns.

          Holloway's emotional range missing in Florence confrontation: The character card establishes Holloway has 'warmth and personality' in their fluting voice, can show 'concern, satisfaction, mild frustration,' and carries 'deep sadness about the first human's death.' However, in the Florence deception confrontation (False Wisdom passage lines 103-169, and The Deception passage throughout), Holloway's emotional expression is limited to 'controlled but tense,' 'dangerous tone,' 'voice shaking,' and 'tiredly.' This is a MAJOR betrayal from someone Holloway trusted - we should see more of their emotional range. Where is the hurt? The grief at another authority figure failing? The personal pain of being lied to by someone they worked closely with? The character card says they 'definitely' have emotions and 'remembers details about Kira and asks how she's doing' - this caring personality should make Florence's betrayal cut deeper. The passages show Holloway as primarily bureaucratic and formal in their hurt, when the character card suggests they should be more emotionally present and expressive, even through their bureaucratic language.

          Holloway's arc contradiction regarding authority frameworks: The character card states Holloway's story arc involves 'learning to integrate care with procedure' and that 'Through repeated failures helping Kira, realizes the manuals aren't sufficient but also aren't useless—they're starting points, not shields against guilt. By the end, uses procedures as tools for care rather than replacements for understanding.' However, in The Answer Arrives passage (line 157-158), after Elder Heartwood's failure, Holloway says 'Another month wait? Two months? For what—more wisdom about ecosystem balance over centuries? Elder Heartwood doesn't think in time frames that help us.' This reads as complete rejection of authority frameworks, not integration. Where is the nuance? Holloway should be processing that Elder Heartwood's wisdom ISN'T useless (just like the HR manuals weren't), it's just being applied wrong. The passage shows bitter rejection when the character arc calls for painful integration - recognizing that authorities have value but aren't complete answers. This is a pivotal moment in Holloway's arc and it's missing the complexity the character card promises.

          Holloway's character growth showing but backstory guilt missing: The character card establishes crucial backstory - Holloway 'carries deep sadness about the first human's death' and their arc involves moving from using 'procedures as shields against guilt' to 'tools for care.' In the Recognition passage, Holloway demonstrates growth by acknowledging Florence's value and offering community (lines 17-101), which shows the 'integrating care with procedure' part of the arc. However, there's no reference to why this growth matters to Holloway personally - the guilt over the first human's death. When Holloway says (line 37) 'What you did before—the fabrications, the betrayals—that still hurt' and later discusses recognition despite pain, this is a perfect moment to reference why Holloway understands both the need for procedure AND the need for genuine care - because procedures alone failed the first human. The character's motivation (guilt, desire to do better) is missing from this pivotal growth moment. We see the growth but not what's driving it.

          Holloway's flaw about not grasping human urgency should surface in Florence confrontation: The character card lists as a key flaw that Holloway 'doesn't understand human urgency or individual self-preservation—will calmly discuss proper incident reporting while Kira is bleeding' and 'views death/injury as resource allocation rather than tragedy.' This flaw should create interesting tension in The Deception passage when discussing Florence's betrayals. Holloway is processing betrayal through authority/trust frameworks (lines 71-72: 'Trust requires honesty. You violated that'), but the character card suggests Holloway should struggle to understand WHY Florence's deception feels urgent to the other plants or why the emotional betrayal matters more than the factual accuracy of the advice. The passage shows Holloway being hurt and formal, but not displaying the characteristic flaw of not quite grasping the urgency/emotional weight from an individual perspective. This is a plant who calmly discusses 'resource reallocation' (death) - that alien perspective should color how they process interpersonal betrayal.

          Holloway's moral compass inconsistency about resource allocation: The character card states in moral-compass that Holloway believes 'Individual parts can be lost (it's natural resource reallocation), but the system should continue functioning properly.' This is reinforced in flaws: 'Views death/injury as resource allocation rather than tragedy.' However, in Wellness Check passage (lines 143-156), when discussing the first human's death, Holloway's response is emotionally appropriate sadness and regret: 'The fluting has changed quality. Sadder.' and 'They didn't survive. We didn't understand quickly enough...' This emotional response contradicts the established moral framework. If Holloway views individual death as 'natural resource reallocation,' they shouldn't express personal sadness about it - or if they DO feel sad (which is more compelling), the character card's moral-compass and flaws need revision to explain why this human's death affected them differently than they view death generally. The passage makes Holloway more emotionally human than the character card's alien perspective allows.

          Bureaucratic comedy timing needs improvement: The character card's humor-style emphasizes 'Unintentionally funny through extreme bureaucratic formality applied to survival situations' with the example 'Your current stress levels appear elevated. Would you like to schedule a wellness consultation? I can manifest a fruiting body at your preferred location within three minutes.' The comedy comes from bureaucratic language during crises. However, in Dietary Assessment passage, Holloway conducts forms AFTER Kira is fed and stable (the passage even notes 'I'm hungry but genuinely interested'). In Intake passage, Kira has already received preliminary treatment and is stable. The bureaucratic absurdity would land harder if Holloway was conducting 'Section Two: Dietary Restrictions' and asking about kosher requirements WHILE Kira is actively starving, or processing intake paperwork while Kira is still bleeding. The character card's comedy relies on inappropriate timing (calm bureaucracy during urgent crisis), but the passages have resolved the urgent situations before the paperwork begins, reducing comedic impact. The timing undermines the humor.

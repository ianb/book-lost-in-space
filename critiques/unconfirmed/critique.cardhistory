          WORLD-BUILDING QUESTION: Remedy's synthesis capabilities vs. mycelial network biology.

          In Dietary Assessment (lines 26-33), Remedy explains: 'I'm analyzing which compounds I can synthesize from available plant chemistry. Proteins are possible—I can fruit mushrooms with complete amino acid profiles. Carbohydrates, easy. Some fats. Vitamins will be... challenging... Each variety produces different compounds! I match the compounds to her nutritional profile.'

          This raises biological questions: How does a fungal network 'decide' what mushrooms to fruit? The character card (line 50, secrets section) states: 'Remedy doesn't actually understand all the medical properties they produce—some mushrooms work through trial and error and fungal instinct, not true comprehension of the chemistry.'

          If Remedy doesn't truly understand the chemistry and works through 'fungal instinct,' how can they rapidly engineer NEW compounds for human nutrition (which they've never encountered before)? How does trial-and-error work when the subject (Kira) can only be tested once and failure could be fatal?

          The character card establishes Remedy as pragmatic and competent but with knowledge gaps. The passages show Remedy successfully engineering complex nutritional compounds for an alien species on first attempt. This seems too easy and doesn't align with the 'trial and error' learning method described in the character card.

          Either Remedy needs to struggle more with human nutrition (some compounds fail, adjustments needed, mentioned mistakes), or the character card's 'secrets' section needs revision to explain how Remedy CAN engineer new compounds so effectively despite not fully understanding the chemistry.

          The moral distinction between 'fabrication' and 'interpretation' needs clearer definition. Florence's character arc hinges on whether she 'fabricated' wisdom or 'interpreted/embellished' Elder Twist's cryptic responses, but the passages don't establish clear boundaries. In Ch10 passage 1, Florence admits 'Most of it' was her own when asked 'How much of Elder Twist's wisdom have you actually been interpreting versus... creating?' In passage 2, she says Elder Twist 'does speak. Sometimes. The fragments are real. But they're... slow. Cryptic. Not immediately helpful. So I... expanded them. Made them relevant. Turned wisdom into actionable guidance.' This creates ambiguity: Is Florence taking real fragments and expanding them (interpretation), or inventing advice whole-cloth and attributing it to Elder Twist (fabrication)? The character card says 'Florence sometimes gives her own opinions as if they're Elder Twist's wisdom, when she knows the elder hasn't actually responded yet or wouldn't care about the issue' (secrets field). This suggests pure fabrication. However, the story-role says 'Elder Twist's responses are too slow or simple to be helpful, so Florence improvises, turning cryptic fragments into actionable wisdom,' which sounds more like aggressive interpretation. This distinction matters enormously for the moral weight—embellishing real (but cryptic) wisdom is different from complete fabrication. The passages should clarify whether Florence had ANY Elder Twist fragments to work from for the hostile plant advice, or if that was pure invention.

          UNCLEAR LOCOMOTION NEVER ADDRESSED AS MYSTERY: Runner's character card states 'How they travel underground and grow/retract so quickly is unclear—the locomotion seems to defy normal plant growth rates' and secrets field says 'Runner genuinely doesn't know how the vine locomotion works—it's instinctive, not understood. Can't explain it even when asked.' This suggests Runner's mysterious underground movement should be a story element that creates intrigue. However, in passages Runner's underground travel is treated as completely normal with no one questioning it. Kira watches 'Runner's vines flowing underground' (ch11) with no curiosity about HOW. The character card's 'unclear locomotion adds to the alien weirdness' is never exploited. Either: (1) Add scenes where Kira or other characters wonder about/discuss how Runner moves underground so fast, possibly ask Runner to explain and get confused non-answers, making it an acknowledged mystery, OR (2) Remove this element from the character card if the locomotion mystery doesn't matter to the story. Currently it's set up in the character card but ignored in the prose.

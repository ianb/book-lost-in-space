          Reviewing Holloway's comedy progression across the edited passages reveals an inconsistent arc that doesn't build smoothly. The character card specifies a clear corruption progression: Early (unintentionally funny bureaucracy) → Middle (HR language contaminated with casual speech, starts having fun without naming it, inside jokes get procedurally formatted) → Late (develops actual sass, jokes get better but still cite Section 7.2, clearly Kira's favorite). The edited passages show: Chapter 9 (Settling In): Omnipresence inversion with some language contamination ('Per Section 3.2—that's actually nice. To hear.') - this is early-to-middle corruption. Chapter 13 (Everyone Contributing): 'Having fun' gag and 'Callback to water filter incident' - these feel early-arc, the kind of moments that should happen BEFORE chapter 9. Chapter 14 (Official Choice): Full sass ('I've documented your objection. I've also documented that you're wrong.') - perfect late-arc corruption. The progression should be linear and building, but instead it peaks in chapter 14 after regressing in chapter 13. The chapter 13 moments feel like they belong around chapters 6-8, when Kira is first corrupting Holloway. By chapter 13 (after major story events like Florence's betrayal and the hostile plant battle), Holloway should already be past the 'observing I'm having fun without naming it' stage and into the 'delivering actual sass' stage. Consider moving the 'having fun' and 'callback' gags to earlier passages, or upgrading the chapter 13 humor to match the late-arc sass level shown in chapter 14.

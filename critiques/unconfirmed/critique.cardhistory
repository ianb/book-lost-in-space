          By Ch4/P3 'Seeking Solutions', Kira's relationship to Uncharted has completely transformed from coping mechanism to genuine joy expression - but the arc of this transformation is invisible.

          EVIDENCE OF TRANSFORMATION:
          Early chapters: 'Mav's voice in my head' - passive, used for survival
          Ch4/P3: 'This is like THE ORACLE EPISODE!' - active excitement, shared reference with Buddy
          Final beat: 'Mav would be SO jealous. This is BETTER than Uncharted.'

          This is beautiful character growth IF INTENTIONAL: she's moved from living through Uncharted to living her own adventure that surpasses it. The lens that kept her removed has become integrated - she can reference the show without hiding behind it.

          PROBLEM: The transformation happens off-screen. We don't see:
          - A moment where she realizes she's not narrating anymore, just living
          - Buddy or a plant pointing out the change
          - Kira making a conscious choice to be present
          - Any scene where she tries to narrate and finds it doesn't fit anymore

          The character card says this flaw is her core issue. If it resolves by Chapter 4 (early in the story), that's a major character arc beat that should be visible and earned.

          RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
          1. Make the transformation explicit - show her noticing and choosing to change
          2. Delay the transformation - keep the flaw active longer so the arc can build
          3. Add cost/relapse - she overcomes it early but falls back into old patterns under stress
          4. Reframe as evolution - the Uncharted lens doesn't disappear, it matures into something healthy

          Currently, it reads like the flaw was forgotten rather than resolved.

          Form literacy module insertion (lines 117-129) has dialogue flow and tonal issues:

          1. Dialogue disconnect: Line 129 ('Buddy, you have no idea how normal and weird this is') doesn't connect to the preceding exchange. Kira just reassured Buddy ('It's okay. We're both figuring this out'), then immediately follows with a line that reads like mild criticism or confusion. This line seems orphaned—unclear what 'normal and weird' refers to at this moment.

          2. Comedy rhythm interruption: The emotional beat (lines 125-127, Buddy expressing insecurity about not helping right) is good character work, but it interrupts the absurdist comedy momentum right before Holloway launches into medical history. The scene was building comedic energy (emergency contact = 'the collective'), and this serious pause makes it harder to jump back into the bureaucratic comedy.

          Suggested fixes: (a) Either cut line 129 or rewrite it to clearly connect to Buddy's self-doubt, (b) Consider moving Buddy's insecurity moment to after the medical history section is complete, letting the comedy section flow uninterrupted, OR (c) make the emotional beat shorter so it doesn't break the rhythm as much.

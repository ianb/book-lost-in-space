          Florence's flowers should betray her emotions during the deception revelation (Ch 10), but no flower colors are mentioned in either confrontation passage. Her character card emphasizes 'The flowers betray emotions she tries to keep controlled—petals tightening when irritated, color shifts when pleased or embarrassed' and 'emotional flower displays make it hard to hide feelings even when she wants to.' The revelation scene in Ch10 passage 1 (False Wisdom) is highly emotional—Florence makes 'a small sound' of distress when caught, her platform 'goes very still,' she's defensive and hurt. But there are no flower color descriptions. Ch10 passage 2 (The Deception) is even more emotional—Florence shouts (which the text notes 'Florence doesn't shout'), she's bitter, in pain, feeling small and manipulated. But again, no flower colors mentioned. This is a missed opportunity for visual storytelling and contradicts the character card's emphasis that her flowers betray emotions she wants to hide. During these confrontations, her flowers should be displaying her emotional state—perhaps mortified colors, defensive tightening, shifts between anger and hurt—precisely because she CAN'T hide her feelings even though she wants to.

          Florence's reaction to losing her Elder Twist interpretation role lacks emotional depth. Her character card establishes that 'Carrying Elder Twist gave me value' and 'took on the role of carrying Elder Twist when the small ancient tree needed mobility' and 'Much of her time is spent waiting for Elder Twist to formulate responses.' This is her primary identity. When Holloway says 'Leave Elder Twist with us. You've lost that privilege' (Ch10 passage 2), Florence's response is minimal—she 'carefully maneuvers Elder Twist's pot off her platform' and 'wheels away slowly, alone for the first time since I've known her.' The text notes 'The absence of Elder Twist on her back is stark' but this is from Kira's POV in passage 3, not Florence's emotional experience. For someone whose entire identity was built around this role ('Being useful means making yourself available, mobile, capable of bridging gaps between fast and slow, young and old'), the physical separation from Elder Twist should be devastating. The moment she sets down the pot should have more weight—perhaps hesitation, flowers betraying distress, the physical lightness of her platform without that weight feeling wrong. The loss of this role is deeply tied to her self-concept ('I'm more refined than the others give me credit for, and carrying Elder Twist is an honor even when it's difficult'), yet this pivotal separation moment feels understated.

          Florence's platform tipping is described as a defining flaw that happens 'frequently' and is 'deeply humiliating,' but it never appears in the story passages. The character card emphasizes this extensively: 'When the platform tips over (which happens more often than she'd like), Florence becomes acutely distressed—flowers closing tight, colors shifting to mortified hues' and 'Worst of all: the wheeled platform frequently tips over on uneven terrain, leaving Florence stuck on her back like an upturned turtle, completely helpless and unable to right herself. This is deeply humiliating for someone who prides herself on elegance' and 'Uneven ground is a constant concern—rocks, roots, slopes all risk tipping the platform over. When it happens (more often than Florence would like to admit), she has to wait, mortified, for someone to come flip her back upright.' This detail appears in multiple fields (emotional-baseline, flaws, normal-life, secrets). However, searching through passages found zero instances of 'tipping' in the story. This is problematic because: (1) It's presented as a frequent occurrence that should appear at least once during the story, especially during the journey chapters or combat scenes with unstable terrain. (2) It's tied to her character arc about vanity, dignity, and needing help from others—themes central to her deception and redemption. (3) It creates vulnerability that would deepen her relationship with other characters who help her. (4) The contrast between her claims of 'elegant wheeled superiority' and this humiliating reality would add meaningful complexity. Either the character card overstates this trait, or passages should include at least one tipping incident.

          The geography and nature of Florence's 'exile' is vague and inconsistent with story logistics. In Ch10 passage 2, Holloway says 'I think Florence should... separate from the group for now' and 'There are other chambers in the facility. You can use one. You're not banned, Florence. But we need distance.' Florence responds 'You're exiling me' and Holloway corrects 'I'm asking for space.' This suggests temporary separation within the same facility. However, Ch10 passage 3 and Ch11 passage 1 describe 'Florence's chamber in the far wing—smaller than the common areas, more isolated' and Florence watching 'through the window' to see hostile plants gathering. The issue: If Florence is just in another room of the same living facility, why is this framed as 'exile'? The facility is described as a living structure grown/maintained by the plants, not a vast complex with distant wings. Florence on her wheeled platform should be able to roll back to the common area in minutes. The 'far wing' and watching through windows suggests significant physical distance, but there's no established geography explaining how large the facility is or why Florence can't just... return whenever. Is she physically prevented from entering common areas? Is it social exile enforced by distance? The mechanics of the separation need clarification—either the facility is much larger than established, or the 'exile' is more social/voluntary than geographical.

        <reason>Clarified geography: old storage wing with rough corridor, social exile not physical lockout</reason>

          The moral distinction between 'fabrication' and 'interpretation' needs clearer definition. Florence's character arc hinges on whether she 'fabricated' wisdom or 'interpreted/embellished' Elder Twist's cryptic responses, but the passages don't establish clear boundaries. In Ch10 passage 1, Florence admits 'Most of it' was her own when asked 'How much of Elder Twist's wisdom have you actually been interpreting versus... creating?' In passage 2, she says Elder Twist 'does speak. Sometimes. The fragments are real. But they're... slow. Cryptic. Not immediately helpful. So I... expanded them. Made them relevant. Turned wisdom into actionable guidance.' This creates ambiguity: Is Florence taking real fragments and expanding them (interpretation), or inventing advice whole-cloth and attributing it to Elder Twist (fabrication)? The character card says 'Florence sometimes gives her own opinions as if they're Elder Twist's wisdom, when she knows the elder hasn't actually responded yet or wouldn't care about the issue' (secrets field). This suggests pure fabrication. However, the story-role says 'Elder Twist's responses are too slow or simple to be helpful, so Florence improvises, turning cryptic fragments into actionable wisdom,' which sounds more like aggressive interpretation. This distinction matters enormously for the moral weight—embellishing real (but cryptic) wisdom is different from complete fabrication. The passages should clarify whether Florence had ANY Elder Twist fragments to work from for the hostile plant advice, or if that was pure invention.

        <reason>Florence clarifies: ~25% real fragments expanded, ~75% pure fabrication</reason>

          MAJOR INCONSISTENCY: Remedy's physical description and manifestation. The character card (line 71-72) states 'Remedy appears as mushrooms of various types, sizes, and colors depending on purpose. Medicinal mushrooms tend to be small, pale, with gilled undersides. Fruiting bodies can emerge within 20 minutes to several hours. Each mushroom is temporary, decomposing back after serving its purpose. When using the robot: one of the two salvaged robots, patched together from various human technology, about 1.5 meters tall, humanoid shape with articulated arms and basic manipulation capabilities.'

          However, in Medical Treatment passage (line 12): 'Small pale clusters emerge from the soil-covered floor, pushing up through the groundcover in accelerated time-lapse. Within minutes, they've fruited fully' - this suggests mushrooms fruit in MINUTES, not '20 minutes to several hours' as specified in the character card.

          More critically, the character card says there are TWO salvaged robots total in the facility, with Remedy controlling ONE of them. But nowhere in the story is there any mention of what happened to the second robot, who controls it, or why only Remedy gets robot access. This is a significant world-building gap - if there are two robots, the other one needs to be accounted for (is it broken? controlled by someone else? stored somewhere?). This becomes especially problematic during action scenes where additional hands/mobility would be useful.

          ABILITY INCONSISTENCY: Remedy's chemical production capabilities are inconsistent across combat scenes.

          In Attack Begins (line 29): 'Remedy spreads toward the western breach, releasing clouds of something that smells sharp and chemical.' Later (line 67-76): Remedy deploys chemical clouds that react with hostile spore clouds, creating neutralization reactions and toxic sludge. Line 143: 'Remedy deploys more defensive chemicals but they're running low. You can only produce so many compounds before exhausting your resources.'

          However, in Together Not Just Coordinated (line 11-12): 'Remedy positions near the gaps between layers one and two—chemical traps ready.' Then successfully deploys chemicals multiple times throughout the extended battle without apparent resource limitations until very late in the fight.

          The character card (line 37-38) mentions as a FLAW: 'Sometimes too focused on immediate chemical solutions, missing social or emotional dimensions of problems. Can be impatient with protocol and bureaucracy even when it serves a purpose. Makes mistakes with mushroom properties—not all the medicinal varieties work as intended, some have unexpected side effects, occasionally grows the wrong compound entirely.'

          Yet in BOTH battle scenes, Remedy's chemistry works perfectly every time. No mention of unexpected side effects, wrong compounds, or mistakes. This is a significant character flaw that should manifest under pressure - the character card explicitly says they make mistakes with compounds, but in actual combat situations (high pressure, rapid deployment), everything works exactly as intended. This undermines the established character trait and makes Remedy too competent/perfect in their specialty.

          CHARACTER ARC CONTRADICTION: Remedy's character arc from the character card is completely absent from the story.

          The character card (line 17, story-role section) explicitly describes Remedy's arc: 'Arc: Large fungal network with unclear boundaries - where does "Remedy" begin and end when the mycelium spreads everywhere, decomposing and connecting? Through interaction with Kira (who has very clear body boundaries) and working as a distinct helper, begins confronting questions of selfhood: If I'm part of the ecosystem connecting everything, am I a person with agency or just a process? Where do I exist when I exist everywhere? This becomes an existential crisis without resolution - Remedy ends the story more uncertain about identity and boundaries than at the beginning. The arc is ongoing confusion, not resolution.'

          However, in Everyone Contributing (lines 65-78), Remedy says: 'I'm developing environmental enhancements. The facility should be comfortable, not just functional... I used to only think about survival chemistry. But Velvet asked what I could do to make their growth smell better. Florence asked about tactical applications of scent for communication. You asked about human-safe fragrances. I realized chemistry can serve joy, not just necessity... I'm making life better.'

          This shows character growth toward purpose and contribution, but there's NO mention of the identity/boundary crisis. No questioning of where Remedy begins and ends. No existential uncertainty about being a person vs. a process. No confusion about selfhood despite being 'literally everywhere things rot' (character card line 38).

          The interaction with Kira (who has clear body boundaries) was supposed to TRIGGER this existential questioning, but it never appears in the prose. This is a major character arc that was planned but never executed in the actual story.

          MISSED OPPORTUNITY: Remedy's 'unsettling decomposition comments' flaw underutilized in farewell scene.

          In Preparation (lines 108-121), Remedy appears for a final wound check before Kira's departure: 'Perfectly healed! Full regeneration, excellent structural integrity. You won't decompose from this injury!' Kira: 'Thanks, Remedy. Your chemistry saved my life.' Remedy: 'Chemistry is what chemistry does... Travel safely. Come back and tell me about the other territories' decomposition patterns. I'm curious.'

          The character card (line 37-38) explicitly states as a flaw: 'Proud of decomposition abilities but doesn't realize how unsettling it is to casually mention being able to break down Kira's dead body very efficiently.'

          This farewell scene was a PERFECT opportunity for Remedy to say something accidentally disturbing about decomposition (like 'If you die in another territory, their decomposers will process you differently than I would - less efficient!' or 'Travel safely! Though if you don't, at least you'll become excellent soil somewhere!'). 

          The character card's humor style (lines 60-68) includes examples like: 'You're approximately 60% water, 20% protein, 15% fat, 5% minerals. Very decomposable. I mean, not that we want to! But chemically speaking, you'd break down beautifully.'

          Instead, Remedy's dialogue is surprisingly tactful and appropriate. This undermines the established character trait of being casually morbid without realizing it. The flaw should manifest MORE in emotional moments (farewells, caring interactions) because that's when Remedy would naturally express care through their decomposition-focused lens, not less.

          WORLD-BUILDING QUESTION: Remedy's synthesis capabilities vs. mycelial network biology.

          In Dietary Assessment (lines 26-33), Remedy explains: 'I'm analyzing which compounds I can synthesize from available plant chemistry. Proteins are possible—I can fruit mushrooms with complete amino acid profiles. Carbohydrates, easy. Some fats. Vitamins will be... challenging... Each variety produces different compounds! I match the compounds to her nutritional profile.'

          This raises biological questions: How does a fungal network 'decide' what mushrooms to fruit? The character card (line 50, secrets section) states: 'Remedy doesn't actually understand all the medical properties they produce—some mushrooms work through trial and error and fungal instinct, not true comprehension of the chemistry.'

          If Remedy doesn't truly understand the chemistry and works through 'fungal instinct,' how can they rapidly engineer NEW compounds for human nutrition (which they've never encountered before)? How does trial-and-error work when the subject (Kira) can only be tested once and failure could be fatal?

          The character card establishes Remedy as pragmatic and competent but with knowledge gaps. The passages show Remedy successfully engineering complex nutritional compounds for an alien species on first attempt. This seems too easy and doesn't align with the 'trial and error' learning method described in the character card.

          Either Remedy needs to struggle more with human nutrition (some compounds fail, adjustments needed, mentioned mistakes), or the character card's 'secrets' section needs revision to explain how Remedy CAN engineer new compounds so effectively despite not fully understanding the chemistry.

          Florence's flowers should betray her emotions during the deception revelation (Ch 10), but no flower colors are mentioned in either confrontation passage. Her character card emphasizes 'The flowers betray emotions she tries to keep controlled—petals tightening when irritated, color shifts when pleased or embarrassed' and 'emotional flower displays make it hard to hide feelings even when she wants to.' The revelation scene in Ch10 passage 1 (False Wisdom) is highly emotional—Florence makes 'a small sound' of distress when caught, her platform 'goes very still,' she's defensive and hurt. But there are no flower color descriptions. Ch10 passage 2 (The Deception) is even more emotional—Florence shouts (which the text notes 'Florence doesn't shout'), she's bitter, in pain, feeling small and manipulated. But again, no flower colors mentioned. This is a missed opportunity for visual storytelling and contradicts the character card's emphasis that her flowers betray emotions she wants to hide. During these confrontations, her flowers should be displaying her emotional state—perhaps mortified colors, defensive tightening, shifts between anger and hurt—precisely because she CAN'T hide her feelings even though she wants to.

          Florence's reaction to losing her Elder Twist interpretation role lacks emotional depth. Her character card establishes that 'Carrying Elder Twist gave me value' and 'took on the role of carrying Elder Twist when the small ancient tree needed mobility' and 'Much of her time is spent waiting for Elder Twist to formulate responses.' This is her primary identity. When Holloway says 'Leave Elder Twist with us. You've lost that privilege' (Ch10 passage 2), Florence's response is minimal—she 'carefully maneuvers Elder Twist's pot off her platform' and 'wheels away slowly, alone for the first time since I've known her.' The text notes 'The absence of Elder Twist on her back is stark' but this is from Kira's POV in passage 3, not Florence's emotional experience. For someone whose entire identity was built around this role ('Being useful means making yourself available, mobile, capable of bridging gaps between fast and slow, young and old'), the physical separation from Elder Twist should be devastating. The moment she sets down the pot should have more weight—perhaps hesitation, flowers betraying distress, the physical lightness of her platform without that weight feeling wrong. The loss of this role is deeply tied to her self-concept ('I'm more refined than the others give me credit for, and carrying Elder Twist is an honor even when it's difficult'), yet this pivotal separation moment feels understated.

          Florence's platform tipping is described as a defining flaw that happens 'frequently' and is 'deeply humiliating,' but it never appears in the story passages. The character card emphasizes this extensively: 'When the platform tips over (which happens more often than she'd like), Florence becomes acutely distressed—flowers closing tight, colors shifting to mortified hues' and 'Worst of all: the wheeled platform frequently tips over on uneven terrain, leaving Florence stuck on her back like an upturned turtle, completely helpless and unable to right herself. This is deeply humiliating for someone who prides herself on elegance' and 'Uneven ground is a constant concern—rocks, roots, slopes all risk tipping the platform over. When it happens (more often than Florence would like to admit), she has to wait, mortified, for someone to come flip her back upright.' This detail appears in multiple fields (emotional-baseline, flaws, normal-life, secrets). However, searching through passages found zero instances of 'tipping' in the story. This is problematic because: (1) It's presented as a frequent occurrence that should appear at least once during the story, especially during the journey chapters or combat scenes with unstable terrain. (2) It's tied to her character arc about vanity, dignity, and needing help from others—themes central to her deception and redemption. (3) It creates vulnerability that would deepen her relationship with other characters who help her. (4) The contrast between her claims of 'elegant wheeled superiority' and this humiliating reality would add meaningful complexity. Either the character card overstates this trait, or passages should include at least one tipping incident.

          The geography and nature of Florence's 'exile' is vague and inconsistent with story logistics. In Ch10 passage 2, Holloway says 'I think Florence should... separate from the group for now' and 'There are other chambers in the facility. You can use one. You're not banned, Florence. But we need distance.' Florence responds 'You're exiling me' and Holloway corrects 'I'm asking for space.' This suggests temporary separation within the same facility. However, Ch10 passage 3 and Ch11 passage 1 describe 'Florence's chamber in the far wing—smaller than the common areas, more isolated' and Florence watching 'through the window' to see hostile plants gathering. The issue: If Florence is just in another room of the same living facility, why is this framed as 'exile'? The facility is described as a living structure grown/maintained by the plants, not a vast complex with distant wings. Florence on her wheeled platform should be able to roll back to the common area in minutes. The 'far wing' and watching through windows suggests significant physical distance, but there's no established geography explaining how large the facility is or why Florence can't just... return whenever. Is she physically prevented from entering common areas? Is it social exile enforced by distance? The mechanics of the separation need clarification—either the facility is much larger than established, or the 'exile' is more social/voluntary than geographical.

        <reason>Clarified geography: old storage wing with rough corridor, social exile not physical lockout</reason>

          The moral distinction between 'fabrication' and 'interpretation' needs clearer definition. Florence's character arc hinges on whether she 'fabricated' wisdom or 'interpreted/embellished' Elder Twist's cryptic responses, but the passages don't establish clear boundaries. In Ch10 passage 1, Florence admits 'Most of it' was her own when asked 'How much of Elder Twist's wisdom have you actually been interpreting versus... creating?' In passage 2, she says Elder Twist 'does speak. Sometimes. The fragments are real. But they're... slow. Cryptic. Not immediately helpful. So I... expanded them. Made them relevant. Turned wisdom into actionable guidance.' This creates ambiguity: Is Florence taking real fragments and expanding them (interpretation), or inventing advice whole-cloth and attributing it to Elder Twist (fabrication)? The character card says 'Florence sometimes gives her own opinions as if they're Elder Twist's wisdom, when she knows the elder hasn't actually responded yet or wouldn't care about the issue' (secrets field). This suggests pure fabrication. However, the story-role says 'Elder Twist's responses are too slow or simple to be helpful, so Florence improvises, turning cryptic fragments into actionable wisdom,' which sounds more like aggressive interpretation. This distinction matters enormously for the moral weight—embellishing real (but cryptic) wisdom is different from complete fabrication. The passages should clarify whether Florence had ANY Elder Twist fragments to work from for the hostile plant advice, or if that was pure invention.

          MAJOR INCONSISTENCY: Remedy's physical description and manifestation. The character card (line 71-72) states 'Remedy appears as mushrooms of various types, sizes, and colors depending on purpose. Medicinal mushrooms tend to be small, pale, with gilled undersides. Fruiting bodies can emerge within 20 minutes to several hours. Each mushroom is temporary, decomposing back after serving its purpose. When using the robot: one of the two salvaged robots, patched together from various human technology, about 1.5 meters tall, humanoid shape with articulated arms and basic manipulation capabilities.'

          However, in Medical Treatment passage (line 12): 'Small pale clusters emerge from the soil-covered floor, pushing up through the groundcover in accelerated time-lapse. Within minutes, they've fruited fully' - this suggests mushrooms fruit in MINUTES, not '20 minutes to several hours' as specified in the character card.

          More critically, the character card says there are TWO salvaged robots total in the facility, with Remedy controlling ONE of them. But nowhere in the story is there any mention of what happened to the second robot, who controls it, or why only Remedy gets robot access. This is a significant world-building gap - if there are two robots, the other one needs to be accounted for (is it broken? controlled by someone else? stored somewhere?). This becomes especially problematic during action scenes where additional hands/mobility would be useful.

          ABILITY INCONSISTENCY: Remedy's chemical production capabilities are inconsistent across combat scenes.

          In Attack Begins (line 29): 'Remedy spreads toward the western breach, releasing clouds of something that smells sharp and chemical.' Later (line 67-76): Remedy deploys chemical clouds that react with hostile spore clouds, creating neutralization reactions and toxic sludge. Line 143: 'Remedy deploys more defensive chemicals but they're running low. You can only produce so many compounds before exhausting your resources.'

          However, in Together Not Just Coordinated (line 11-12): 'Remedy positions near the gaps between layers one and two—chemical traps ready.' Then successfully deploys chemicals multiple times throughout the extended battle without apparent resource limitations until very late in the fight.

          The character card (line 37-38) mentions as a FLAW: 'Sometimes too focused on immediate chemical solutions, missing social or emotional dimensions of problems. Can be impatient with protocol and bureaucracy even when it serves a purpose. Makes mistakes with mushroom properties—not all the medicinal varieties work as intended, some have unexpected side effects, occasionally grows the wrong compound entirely.'

          Yet in BOTH battle scenes, Remedy's chemistry works perfectly every time. No mention of unexpected side effects, wrong compounds, or mistakes. This is a significant character flaw that should manifest under pressure - the character card explicitly says they make mistakes with compounds, but in actual combat situations (high pressure, rapid deployment), everything works exactly as intended. This undermines the established character trait and makes Remedy too competent/perfect in their specialty.

          CHARACTER ARC CONTRADICTION: Remedy's character arc from the character card is completely absent from the story.

          The character card (line 17, story-role section) explicitly describes Remedy's arc: 'Arc: Large fungal network with unclear boundaries - where does "Remedy" begin and end when the mycelium spreads everywhere, decomposing and connecting? Through interaction with Kira (who has very clear body boundaries) and working as a distinct helper, begins confronting questions of selfhood: If I'm part of the ecosystem connecting everything, am I a person with agency or just a process? Where do I exist when I exist everywhere? This becomes an existential crisis without resolution - Remedy ends the story more uncertain about identity and boundaries than at the beginning. The arc is ongoing confusion, not resolution.'

          However, in Everyone Contributing (lines 65-78), Remedy says: 'I'm developing environmental enhancements. The facility should be comfortable, not just functional... I used to only think about survival chemistry. But Velvet asked what I could do to make their growth smell better. Florence asked about tactical applications of scent for communication. You asked about human-safe fragrances. I realized chemistry can serve joy, not just necessity... I'm making life better.'

          This shows character growth toward purpose and contribution, but there's NO mention of the identity/boundary crisis. No questioning of where Remedy begins and ends. No existential uncertainty about being a person vs. a process. No confusion about selfhood despite being 'literally everywhere things rot' (character card line 38).

          The interaction with Kira (who has clear body boundaries) was supposed to TRIGGER this existential questioning, but it never appears in the prose. This is a major character arc that was planned but never executed in the actual story.

          MISSED OPPORTUNITY: Remedy's 'unsettling decomposition comments' flaw underutilized in farewell scene.

          In Preparation (lines 108-121), Remedy appears for a final wound check before Kira's departure: 'Perfectly healed! Full regeneration, excellent structural integrity. You won't decompose from this injury!' Kira: 'Thanks, Remedy. Your chemistry saved my life.' Remedy: 'Chemistry is what chemistry does... Travel safely. Come back and tell me about the other territories' decomposition patterns. I'm curious.'

          The character card (line 37-38) explicitly states as a flaw: 'Proud of decomposition abilities but doesn't realize how unsettling it is to casually mention being able to break down Kira's dead body very efficiently.'

          This farewell scene was a PERFECT opportunity for Remedy to say something accidentally disturbing about decomposition (like 'If you die in another territory, their decomposers will process you differently than I would - less efficient!' or 'Travel safely! Though if you don't, at least you'll become excellent soil somewhere!'). 

          The character card's humor style (lines 60-68) includes examples like: 'You're approximately 60% water, 20% protein, 15% fat, 5% minerals. Very decomposable. I mean, not that we want to! But chemically speaking, you'd break down beautifully.'

          Instead, Remedy's dialogue is surprisingly tactful and appropriate. This undermines the established character trait of being casually morbid without realizing it. The flaw should manifest MORE in emotional moments (farewells, caring interactions) because that's when Remedy would naturally express care through their decomposition-focused lens, not less.

          WORLD-BUILDING QUESTION: Remedy's synthesis capabilities vs. mycelial network biology.

          In Dietary Assessment (lines 26-33), Remedy explains: 'I'm analyzing which compounds I can synthesize from available plant chemistry. Proteins are possible—I can fruit mushrooms with complete amino acid profiles. Carbohydrates, easy. Some fats. Vitamins will be... challenging... Each variety produces different compounds! I match the compounds to her nutritional profile.'

          This raises biological questions: How does a fungal network 'decide' what mushrooms to fruit? The character card (line 50, secrets section) states: 'Remedy doesn't actually understand all the medical properties they produce—some mushrooms work through trial and error and fungal instinct, not true comprehension of the chemistry.'

          If Remedy doesn't truly understand the chemistry and works through 'fungal instinct,' how can they rapidly engineer NEW compounds for human nutrition (which they've never encountered before)? How does trial-and-error work when the subject (Kira) can only be tested once and failure could be fatal?

          The character card establishes Remedy as pragmatic and competent but with knowledge gaps. The passages show Remedy successfully engineering complex nutritional compounds for an alien species on first attempt. This seems too easy and doesn't align with the 'trial and error' learning method described in the character card.

          Either Remedy needs to struggle more with human nutrition (some compounds fail, adjustments needed, mentioned mistakes), or the character card's 'secrets' section needs revision to explain how Remedy CAN engineer new compounds so effectively despite not fully understanding the chemistry.

          MAJOR ROBOT OWNERSHIP INCONSISTENCY: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0) states that Velvet is 'sentient moss growing on one of the salvaged robots' and that Velvet 'can control the robot' (physical description line 107 says 'shares robot control with Remedy, Runner, and Sweetpea'). However, in Chapter 3 Passage 3 (Medical Treatment), Remedy is introduced as controlling 'a robot' - described as 'humanoid in basic shape, roughly 1.5 meters tall, articulated arms and legs, clearly patched together from salvaged parts' with 'jerky' movements. The passage states 'The mushrooms pulse slightly—some kind of communication between fungal network and robot' suggesting Remedy controls this robot.

          This creates a fundamental contradiction: Does Remedy have their own dedicated robot, or do multiple plants (Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Sweetpea) share control of robots? The character card says 'shares robot control' (plural plants, shared robots), but the early passage shows Remedy with what appears to be an exclusive robot connection.

          Additionally, Velvet is never introduced to Kira in any passage I can find. Velvet appears in Chapter 10 (False Wisdom) already established as a known character who 'maintains the boundary plants,' but there's no earlier passage where Kira meets Velvet or learns that the moss is sentient. This is a significant narrative gap - Kira's reaction to discovering MOSS IS SENTIENT should be a memorable moment, but it's missing.

          Possible resolutions:
          1. Clarify that there are multiple robots, some dedicated (Remedy's) and some shared (the one Velvet grows on)
          2. Add an earlier passage where Kira meets Velvet and reacts to sentient moss
          3. Revise Velvet's physical description to clarify the robot-sharing arrangement
          4. Check if 'Sweetpea' is another character that needs to be created or if this is an error

          VELVET DIALOGUE INCONSISTENCY - Robot voice vs moss communication: Velvet's character card specifies they use 'the robot's voice' when speaking (speaking-style line 56-57: 'Very brief when using the robot's voice'). The humor-style examples (lines 76-105) show Velvet speaking through a robot voice system.

          However, in Chapter 11 Passage 1 (Delegation Fails), line 25 refers to 'Velvet's growth near the facility—not the delegation Velvet, a smaller offshoot maintaining the building' which then speaks and asks 'How distributed?' This implies Velvet can speak without the robot (as an 'offshoot' separate from the main colony on the robot).

          This creates confusion about Velvet's communication mechanism:
          - Can Velvet speak independently as moss, or only through the robot?
          - If Velvet is a distributed consciousness across multiple locations (main colony on robot + offshoot maintaining building), how do they communicate from the offshoot?
          - Line 25 treating the robot-Velvet and building-Velvet as separate entities ('not the delegation Velvet') contradicts the character card's description of Velvet as a single distributed moss colony.

          The character card needs clarification: Can Velvet's distributed consciousness communicate from any location where moss exists, or is the robot voice the only communication method?

          VELVET'S TACTICAL/CREATIVE COMPLEXITY MAY EXCEED CHARACTER CARD DEFINITION: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0) emphasizes extreme simplicity: 'very moss-like: simple, slow, literal, focused on basic moss concerns' (overview line 24), 'Extremely simple and literal—doesn't understand complex ideas or nuance' (flaws line 37), and worldview is 'Surfaces are for growing. Light is for making food. Dry makes me slow. Wet makes me fast. The robot is a good surface. Moving the robot means accessing new surfaces. Simple.' (lines 27-28).

          However, in later passages, Velvet demonstrates sophisticated tactical and creative thinking that seems inconsistent with this extreme simplicity:

          1. Chapter 12 Passage 1 (Voices Emerging, lines 64-76): Velvet interrupts Florence to propose 'layered defense' concept—'Instead of one thick barrier, multiple thinner layers with gaps between them. Attackers break through the first layer, encounter empty space, then hit a second layer. Disrupts their momentum.' Florence calls this 'brilliant' and says 'It's better than what I was planning.' This is complex tactical thinking involving momentum, misdirection, and multi-stage defense strategy—far beyond 'simple moss concerns.'

          2. Chapter 13 Passage 2 (Signal From Outside, line 17): Velvet offers 'I can grow directional antenna. If someone tells me the specifications.' This shows understanding of technical specifications and ability to execute complex engineering tasks based on parameters.

          3. Chapter 14 Passage 2 (Demonstrating Belonging, lines 27-36): Velvet creates 'translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns. The ergonomic seating, the comfortable proportions' with 'Kira's feedback shaped every decision' and consideration of 'how spaces feel, not just whether they're functional.' This demonstrates aesthetic awareness, human ergonomics understanding, and iterative design thinking.

          While the character arc notes Velvet 'discovering that moss can want things, have opinions, feel connections' and 'developing complexity,' the specific examples seem to go beyond developing personhood into demonstrating sophisticated strategic, technical, and design capabilities that contradict the fundamental 'extremely simple and literal' characterization.

          Possible resolutions:
          1. Revise character card to acknowledge Velvet has capacity for complex spatial/structural thinking even while remaining simple in other ways
          2. Revise passages to show Velvet's contributions as simpler/more intuitive ('layers feel better' vs explaining tactical momentum disruption)
          3. Add more character development passages showing Velvet's surprising emergence of complexity as a plot point that others notice and comment on

          VELVET'S FIRST APPEARANCE IS MISSING: Velvet appears in the story already established as a known character with no introduction scene. In Chapter 11 Passage 1 (Delegation Fails, line 3), the narrative states 'Runner and Velvet leave at dawn' as if Kira already knows who Velvet is. Later (line 25) refers to 'Velvet's growth near the facility' maintaining the building, implying Velvet has been present for some time.

          However, searching through all earlier passages (Chapters 1-10), there is NO scene where:
          - Kira is introduced to Velvet
          - Kira discovers that moss is sentient  
          - Kira learns Velvet's name
          - Kira reacts to the existence of sentient moss

          This is a significant narrative gap. The character card's humor-style section (lines 91-97) includes an example of Kira's reaction to learning Velvet is moss:
          '[Kira learns Velvet is moss]
          Kira: "Wait. Velvet, what are you?"
          Velvet: "Moss."
          Kira: "Of course you are."
          [long pause]
          Velvet: "Green moss."'

          But this scene never appears in any passage. Velvet simply appears in Chapter 10-11 as an established character performing tasks (maintaining boundary plants, going on delegation).

          Resolution needed: Add a passage in Chapters 4-9 where Kira first encounters Velvet, learns that moss can be sentient, and has the 'of course you are' reaction. This should be a memorable moment given how absurdist the premise is (moss controlling a robot). The character card suggests this comedy beat exists, but it's missing from the actual story.

          VELVET'S TRANSLUCENT GROWTH CONTRADICTS PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0, physical-description lines 106-108) describes Velvet as 'Soft green moss growing in patches on one of the salvaged robots. Covers the shoulder area (approximately 15cm patch), some of the upper back, and smaller spots on the arms. Bright to medium green coloring, soft velvety texture.'

          However, in later chapters, Velvet creates structures described as 'translucent':
          - Chapter 14 Passage 2 (Demonstrating Belonging, line 27): 'Torres examines the translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns'
          - Chapter 14 Passage 3 (Where Voices Belong, line 3): 'Velvet's translucent growth catches the light beautifully'
          - Chapter 13 Passage 3 (Finding Home, line 3): Velvet shows 'new beautiful structure—translucent layers, light patterns'

          This creates a contradiction: Is Velvet's moss 'bright to medium green' (opaque green moss) or 'translucent' (light passes through)? Moss is typically opaque due to chlorophyll content.

          Possible explanations/resolutions:
          1. Velvet has developed a new growth form (translucent moss structures) distinct from the original green moss on the robot - this would be a significant character development that should be noted
          2. 'Translucent' refers to thin layers of green moss that allow some light through (like thin leaves) - revise character card to note this property
          3. The passages are describing different types of growth - standard moss vs specialized structures
          4. This is an error and needs correction for consistency

          The character card should clarify whether Velvet can create different types of growth structures with different optical properties, or if all Velvet's moss has the same appearance.

          MISSING INTRODUCTION FOR RUNNER: Runner appears in chapter 9, passage 1 with established familiarity (vines wrapping around Kira's wrist, Kira extending her hand, distinguishing different types of Runner's touches) but Runner has NO introduction passage. The character card exists, but readers have never been introduced to Runner - we don't know what she looks like, how she moves, how Kira first reacted to her. The passage assumes we already know Runner ('Runner emerges from the underground access, vines uncoiling. They immediately flow toward me—Runner always does') but this is her first appearance in the story. Either: (1) Runner needs an introduction passage earlier in the story (chapter 3-4 during onboarding/adaptation when other plants are introduced), OR (2) This passage needs to introduce Runner properly with [Introduces: Runner - vining plant that travels underground] annotation and prose that describes her appearance and nature for first-time readers.

          ROBOT USAGE COMPLETELY ABSENT: Runner's character card states she 'can control one of the robots for tasks requiring hands' and shares robot control with Remedy, Sweetpea, and Velvet. The speaking-style examples show Runner using robot hands ('robot hands already touching Kira's injured arm', 'holding a tool'). However, across ALL passages reviewed (chapters 9-14), Runner appears ONLY as vines - never once using a robot. She provides underground intelligence, emerges from soil, wraps vines around things, but never manifests through robot control. Either: (1) Add scenes where Runner uses the robot (especially for tasks requiring dexterity - repairs, manipulating tools, etc.), OR (2) Revise the character card if Runner doesn't actually use robots in this story. The current disconnect makes the character card misleading - readers expect robot-using Runner but only get vine Runner.

          MISSING CHARACTER ARC - COMPULSIVE TOUCHING NEVER SHOWN: Runner's character card establishes her PRIMARY trait/flaw as compulsive boundary-crossing touch ('extremely tactile in a way that crosses boundaries', 'wraps vines around people's arms, faces, injuries', 'touches everything constantly', 'has a hard time stopping even when asked'). The character card also describes an arc where 'pure curiosity develops into affection' and Runner learns the difference. However, by chapter 9 passage 1 (Runner's first clear appearance), the touching has already changed - she 'waits for permission' and touches are described as gentle affection rather than compulsive exploration. We NEVER see the problematic touching behavior or the transformation. Either: (1) Show Runner's compulsive touching earlier in the story (chapters 3-5) where she makes Kira uncomfortable, wraps around her without asking, explores her injuries invasively, gets distracted by textures - then show the gradual change over chapters 6-9, OR (2) Revise the character card to match what's actually in the prose (Runner who is tactile but learns boundaries quickly). The current state skips Runner's entire character arc.

          SPEAKING STYLE INCONSISTENCY: Runner's character card speaking-style shows someone who 'gets sidetracked mid-sentence by how something feels', constantly distracted by textures, asks about surfaces/temperatures, forgets what she was doing. Example dialogue shows: 'I can help with that— [touches arm] —this is hot. Or warm? Puffy. Why is it puffy?' and 'Heavy. No wait, not that heavy... You were using this for something?' However, in actual passages Runner speaks clearly and directly about tactical matters with NO texture distractions: 'Messages. Territory markers. Warnings.' (ch10), 'They rejected the delegation. Wouldn't even let us finish explaining our position.' (ch11), 'I've been thinking about when you leave...' (ch13). Runner discusses underground intelligence, resonance structures, and strategic planning without getting distracted by how things feel. Either: (1) Add Runner's tactile distractions to her dialogue - she should touch things while talking, get sidetracked by textures, make observations about surfaces that aren't quite useful, OR (2) Revise the character card speaking-style to match her actual focused, tactical communication style in the prose.

          HUMOR STYLE COMPLETELY ABSENT: Runner's character card has extensive humor-style examples showing comedy from compulsive touching, boundary violations, and genuine confusion about personal space. Examples include wrapping vines around Kira's face while trying to understand why she's uncomfortable, touching Holloway's fruiting structures despite being asked to stop, emerging right next to Kira's foot and wrapping around her food. This is meant to be a source of comedy in the story. However, NONE of this humor appears in the actual passages. Runner never makes anyone uncomfortable with touching, never violates Holloway's or other plants' boundaries, never creates comedic moments through tactile invasion. The humor-style in the character card describes a completely different character than what appears in the prose. Either: (1) Add comedic scenes of Runner's boundary-crossing behavior (especially early in story), showing her touching Scout, Holloway, Velvet without permission and creating awkward moments, OR (2) Delete the humor-style examples from the character card as they don't match the actual character who appears.

          CRITICAL CONSISTENCY VIOLATION: Scout has internal narration voice in passage text.

          In passage 14.2 Demonstrating Belonging, line 59, Scout's bounces are narrated with words:

          'Scout bounces between me and Torres. Love Kira bounce. Happy Kira staying bounce. Want captain to understand bounce.'

          This directly contradicts Scout's character card which explicitly states Scout CANNOT SPEAK and communicates entirely through movement (speaking-style: 'N/A - Scout cannot speak. Communicates entirely through movement: bouncing patterns, circling, rolling speeds, and positioning').

          The character card's story-role section specifies Scout's arc is about developing 'richer forms of non-verbal communication beyond just tumbling and being interpreted by others' - this means Scout should NEVER have verbal internal narration or word-based thoughts attributed to them, even in prose shorthand.

          The passage gives Scout word-thoughts like 'Love Kira bounce' and 'Want captain to understand bounce.' This breaks the fundamental constraint of the character. Scout's communication should be shown through physical movement only, with interpretation coming from Kira or others observing the bouncing patterns.

          CORRECTION NEEDED: Rewrite these lines to show Scout's physical bouncing behavior without attributing verbal thoughts. For example: 'Scout bounces excitedly between me and Torres - enthusiastic, insistent bounces that seem to be trying to demonstrate something to the captain.' Let readers and characters interpret the meaning from the physical movement, not from word-based narration.

          INCONSISTENCY: Scout uses tendrils to communicate in first appearance, but this method is never used again and contradicts character card description.

          In passage 2.2 (Scout's introduction), lines 85-87 describe: 'A small tendril extends from the sphere's surface. Thin, delicate, reaching toward my bandage. Getting closer.'

          Scout's character card describes Scout as communicating 'entirely through movement: bouncing patterns, circling, rolling speeds, and positioning' with no mention of tendrils as a communication method. The physical-description specifies 'Small leaves and thin tendrils protrude from the surface' but these are described as part of the fuzzy appearance, not as communication tools.

          After this first passage, Scout NEVER uses tendrils again throughout the entire story. All subsequent Scout communication is through bouncing, rolling, circling, and positioning - which matches the character card. This creates an inconsistency where Scout has an ability in the first encounter that disappears and is never referenced again.

          SUGGESTED FIX: Either (1) remove the tendril-reaching moment from passage 2.2 and replace with a different physical approach (bouncing closer, circling tighter around the injury), OR (2) establish tendrils as a deliberate communication tool in the character card and have Scout use them occasionally throughout the story for specific purposes (like pointing or indicating).

          PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION INCONSISTENCY: Scout's size described differently across passages.

          Scout's character card physical-description specifies: 'Spherical plant organism, approximately 30 cm in diameter.'

          This is quite specific - 30 centimeters (about 12 inches, roughly the size of a large beach ball).

          However, in passage 2.2 (First Contact), Scout is described as: 'maybe the size of a basketball' which is approximately 24 cm diameter - noticeably smaller than the character card specification.

          In passage 3.3 (Medical Treatment), Scout is described as pressing 'against my hand' and later as a 'small plant' - language that's consistent with the 30cm specification.

          ISSUE: The basketball comparison in the introduction creates a mental image that's about 20% smaller than Scout's actual size. This matters because:
          1. A 30cm sphere is notably larger and heavier than a basketball
          2. Physical interactions (Scout pressing against Kira's leg, settling near her) would feel different with the larger size
          3. Consistency helps readers maintain a stable mental image

          SUGGESTED FIX: In passage 2.2, change 'maybe the size of a basketball' to 'maybe the size of a large beach ball' or 'roughly thirty centimeters across' to match the character card specification. Alternatively, if basketball-sized feels more appropriate for the story, update the character card to specify approximately 24cm diameter.

          MISSING CHARACTER ARC DEVELOPMENT: Scout's promised arc of developing richer non-verbal communication is not shown evolving through the story.

          Scout's character card story-role specifies an arc: 'Never speaks throughout the story but develops richer forms of non-verbal communication beyond just tumbling and being interpreted by others. Discovers new ways to express nuance, emotion, specificity without words. Others (including Kira) learn to read Scout better, to listen without needing verbal translation. Scout develops clearer desires/preferences that can be communicated physically. By the end, Scout has a fuller voice that doesn't require speech - communication is validated as equally rich and complex as verbal language.'

          However, throughout the story Scout's communication remains fairly static: enthusiastic bouncing, circling, settling nearby. There's no clear progression showing Scout developing MORE sophisticated or nuanced communication methods, nor scenes showing Kira learning to read Scout's movements with greater precision.

          In passage 13.2, Scout shows 'celebration muted—happy-sad, confused' which suggests emotional complexity, but this complexity isn't shown through evolved bouncing patterns or new communication techniques - it's just stated in narration.

          NEEDED: Specific scenes showing:
          1. Early story: Kira struggling to interpret Scout's bounces, needing other plants to translate
          2. Mid story: Kira beginning to distinguish different bounce patterns (urgent vs happy vs worried)
          3. Late story: Scout and Kira having complex 'conversations' through movement that others can observe and understand, demonstrating that non-verbal communication can be as nuanced as speech

          The arc should culminate in a moment where Scout communicates something complex and important entirely through movement, validating that Scout's voice is heard and valued despite never speaking.

        <reason>Added arc progression: Ch3 wondering about bounces, Ch5 mutual learning, Ch6-8 recognizing Scout's scouting/language</reason>

          BEHAVIORAL INCONSISTENCY: Scout's role and function vary inconsistently across passages.

          Scout's character card establishes Scout as 'a scout/messenger - recognized role among the plants' who 'Acts as messenger and scout' with motives including 'Explore and find new things • Get others to notice what I've found • Help keep everyone safe.'

          However, across the story Scout functions primarily as Kira's companion/comfort animal rather than as a scout fulfilling their established role:

          - In orientation (3.2) and morning wellness (4.1), Scout is present but passive - just 'bouncing approval' and providing comfort
          - Scout's actual scouting activities are barely shown. In passage 10.1, Scout 'returns from patrol urgent' which is the ONLY time we see Scout doing actual scouting work
          - Scout's flaws specify 'Can only communicate by drawing attention—can't explain what something is or why it matters, just point at it. Gets equally excited about truly dangerous things and mildly interesting things.' But we never see Scout finding things and trying to alert others (except the very first encounter with Kira)

          Scout's character card suggests they should regularly be: ranging out to explore, finding things, returning to alert the group, leading people to discoveries. Instead Scout mostly just follows Kira around bouncing supportively.

          SUGGESTED FIX: Add scenes showing Scout's scouting behavior:
          - Finding resources or interesting locations during the journey and leading guides to them
          - Doing perimeter patrols at campsites and alerting to changes
          - Discovering something mildly interesting (like crystalline rocks in 8.1) and getting very excited, requiring Kira to determine if it's actually important
          This would show Scout fulfilling their established role while also being Kira's companion.

          Holloway's omnipresence comedy underutilized: The character card specifically calls out that 'I'm already there' is Holloway's signature comedic line that 'becomes comedic through repetition' and that their 'uncanny omnipresence' is both helpful and eerie. The humor-style field emphasizes 'The uncanny omnipresence—"I am already there"—becomes comedic through repetition.' However, in Morning Wellness passage, Holloway appears (line 19) via fruiting body but doesn't use this signature line. This is a perfect setup - Kira needs her wellness check, Holloway appears - but the comedic opportunity is missed. The character's distinctive humor element (appearing everywhere simultaneously through fruiting bodies) should be deployed more consistently throughout the story. This comedic beat should happen regularly enough to become a running gag that readers anticipate, not just occasionally. The passage treats Holloway's appearance as routine rather than playing up the delightful weirdness of a plant that's always already wherever you need them.

          Missing Holloway's personal warmth and remembered details: The character card emphasizes that Holloway has 'warmth and personality even if it sounds alien,' shows 'genuine concern,' 'remembers details about Kira and asks how she's doing,' and gets 'satisfaction from successful coordination.' However, in both Intake (passage 1) and Dietary Assessment (passage 2), Holloway conducts lengthy form-filling sessions without displaying these personal touches. Compare to the speaking-style example in the character card where Holloway says 'Oh good, I'm already there—I fruiting near the water source earlier. Kira, we need to document...' - notice how it starts with personal acknowledgment BEFORE diving into bureaucracy. In the actual passages, Holloway jumps straight into forms without asking 'How are you feeling today?' or 'I noticed you seemed tired yesterday' or referencing previous conversations. The 'office manager energy: remembers details about Kira, shows genuine concern' is missing. The bureaucracy is there but the caring office manager personality underneath it is insufficiently portrayed.

          Holloway's distributed consciousness flaw not shown when explaining journey: The character card establishes that Holloway's 'distributed consciousness means Holloway sometimes starts conversations mid-thought, assuming Kira knows context from a different fruiting body.' This specific flaw/quirk should appear when explaining complex multi-territory journey logistics in Journey Option passage. Holloway is explaining intricate travel details (lines 6-108) but speaks in complete, linear explanations without any mid-conversation jumps or assumptions that Kira already knows something Holloway mentioned to a different fruiting body earlier. This is a perfect opportunity to show the alien distributed cognition - Holloway could reference details they already explained 'earlier' (but to a fruiting body Kira wasn't near), or start mid-thought about Territory Three before explaining Territory Two. The passage treats Holloway as a single unified consciousness presenting information clearly, when the character card describes someone whose distributed nature creates communication quirks.

          Holloway's moral compass inconsistency about resource allocation: The character card states in moral-compass that Holloway believes 'Individual parts can be lost (it's natural resource reallocation), but the system should continue functioning properly.' This is reinforced in flaws: 'Views death/injury as resource allocation rather than tragedy.' However, in Wellness Check passage (lines 143-156), when discussing the first human's death, Holloway's response is emotionally appropriate sadness and regret: 'The fluting has changed quality. Sadder.' and 'They didn't survive. We didn't understand quickly enough...' This emotional response contradicts the established moral framework. If Holloway views individual death as 'natural resource reallocation,' they shouldn't express personal sadness about it - or if they DO feel sad (which is more compelling), the character card's moral-compass and flaws need revision to explain why this human's death affected them differently than they view death generally. The passage makes Holloway more emotionally human than the character card's alien perspective allows.

          Holloway's character growth showing but backstory guilt missing: The character card establishes crucial backstory - Holloway 'carries deep sadness about the first human's death' and their arc involves moving from using 'procedures as shields against guilt' to 'tools for care.' In the Recognition passage, Holloway demonstrates growth by acknowledging Florence's value and offering community (lines 17-101), which shows the 'integrating care with procedure' part of the arc. However, there's no reference to why this growth matters to Holloway personally - the guilt over the first human's death. When Holloway says (line 37) 'What you did before—the fabrications, the betrayals—that still hurt' and later discusses recognition despite pain, this is a perfect moment to reference why Holloway understands both the need for procedure AND the need for genuine care - because procedures alone failed the first human. The character's motivation (guilt, desire to do better) is missing from this pivotal growth moment. We see the growth but not what's driving it.

          Holloway's speaking-style consistency issue: The character card establishes that Holloway's fluting voice produces 'woodwind-like tones' through air moving through hollow fruiting bodies, and the speaking style should be 'warm and engaged but expresses everything through bureaucratic procedures.' However, in the Wellness Check passage (lines 28, 40, 66, 104, etc.), Holloway speaks with normal punctuation and cadence without any indication of the distinctive fluting quality. The voice sounds like a regular person using bureaucratic language, not a woodwind-like instrument. Compare to the speaking-style example in the character card which has more formal, procedural structure. The passages don't capture the alien quality of communication through fruiting bodies - it reads too human. Either the passages need to incorporate more distinctive alien speech patterns (perhaps unusual pauses, musical cadences, or references to the physical mechanism), or the character card needs to acknowledge that the fluting voice translates cleanly into standard speech patterns.

          Holloway's arc contradiction regarding authority frameworks: The character card states Holloway's story arc involves 'learning to integrate care with procedure' and that 'Through repeated failures helping Kira, realizes the manuals aren't sufficient but also aren't useless—they're starting points, not shields against guilt. By the end, uses procedures as tools for care rather than replacements for understanding.' However, in The Answer Arrives passage (line 157-158), after Elder Heartwood's failure, Holloway says 'Another month wait? Two months? For what—more wisdom about ecosystem balance over centuries? Elder Heartwood doesn't think in time frames that help us.' This reads as complete rejection of authority frameworks, not integration. Where is the nuance? Holloway should be processing that Elder Heartwood's wisdom ISN'T useless (just like the HR manuals weren't), it's just being applied wrong. The passage shows bitter rejection when the character arc calls for painful integration - recognizing that authorities have value but aren't complete answers. This is a pivotal moment in Holloway's arc and it's missing the complexity the character card promises.

          Holloway's emotional range missing in Florence confrontation: The character card establishes Holloway has 'warmth and personality' in their fluting voice, can show 'concern, satisfaction, mild frustration,' and carries 'deep sadness about the first human's death.' However, in the Florence deception confrontation (False Wisdom passage lines 103-169, and The Deception passage throughout), Holloway's emotional expression is limited to 'controlled but tense,' 'dangerous tone,' 'voice shaking,' and 'tiredly.' This is a MAJOR betrayal from someone Holloway trusted - we should see more of their emotional range. Where is the hurt? The grief at another authority figure failing? The personal pain of being lied to by someone they worked closely with? The character card says they 'definitely' have emotions and 'remembers details about Kira and asks how she's doing' - this caring personality should make Florence's betrayal cut deeper. The passages show Holloway as primarily bureaucratic and formal in their hurt, when the character card suggests they should be more emotionally present and expressive, even through their bureaucratic language.

          Holloway's flaw about not grasping human urgency should surface in Florence confrontation: The character card lists as a key flaw that Holloway 'doesn't understand human urgency or individual self-preservation—will calmly discuss proper incident reporting while Kira is bleeding' and 'views death/injury as resource allocation rather than tragedy.' This flaw should create interesting tension in The Deception passage when discussing Florence's betrayals. Holloway is processing betrayal through authority/trust frameworks (lines 71-72: 'Trust requires honesty. You violated that'), but the character card suggests Holloway should struggle to understand WHY Florence's deception feels urgent to the other plants or why the emotional betrayal matters more than the factual accuracy of the advice. The passage shows Holloway being hurt and formal, but not displaying the characteristic flaw of not quite grasping the urgency/emotional weight from an individual perspective. This is a plant who calmly discusses 'resource reallocation' (death) - that alien perspective should color how they process interpersonal betrayal.

          Bureaucratic comedy timing needs improvement: The character card's humor-style emphasizes 'Unintentionally funny through extreme bureaucratic formality applied to survival situations' with the example 'Your current stress levels appear elevated. Would you like to schedule a wellness consultation? I can manifest a fruiting body at your preferred location within three minutes.' The comedy comes from bureaucratic language during crises. However, in Dietary Assessment passage, Holloway conducts forms AFTER Kira is fed and stable (the passage even notes 'I'm hungry but genuinely interested'). In Intake passage, Kira has already received preliminary treatment and is stable. The bureaucratic absurdity would land harder if Holloway was conducting 'Section Two: Dietary Restrictions' and asking about kosher requirements WHILE Kira is actively starving, or processing intake paperwork while Kira is still bleeding. The character card's comedy relies on inappropriate timing (calm bureaucracy during urgent crisis), but the passages have resolved the urgent situations before the paperwork begins, reducing comedic impact. The timing undermines the humor.

          The omnipresence inversion gag at lines 99-119 in 'Settling In' is excellent and perfectly timed for Holloway's character arc. At chapter 9, Kira has been influencing Holloway for weeks, making this the right point for the gag to invert. The passage shows Kira actually having to FIND Holloway (who isn't omnipresent for once), and Holloway's response reveals the corruption: 'I wasn't—I mean, I could have fruited near the filter if you needed—' followed by the contaminated HR language at line 117: 'Per Section 3.2—' pause, then 'that's actually nice. To hear.' This demonstrates both the language contamination ('that's actually nice') and Holloway not fully acknowledging the change. However, there's a consistency issue: the character card says the omnipresence gag should invert with 'Kira catches Holloway NOT being there,' but line 117 has Holloway saying 'I'll... note that preference' which feels too self-aware. Holloway should be more confused about their own changed behavior, not accommodating Kira's preference so readily. The character card specifies: 'Other plants notice Holloway is different; Holloway insists it's "for documentation purposes."' This self-justification pattern is missing here.

          The emotional depth added at line 169 in 'False Wisdom' is a significant character moment but creates a consistency issue with Holloway's established voice and alien perspective. The passage reads: 'This isn't Holloway being bureaucratic—this is Holloway being hurt. And I realize: Holloway trusted Florence. Worked alongside her. Asked for her interpretations, valued her input, built coordination around her role. That trust is personal, not just procedural. Holloway's fruiting bodies have dimmed—the warm bioluminescence gone gray at the edges, like something vital has been drained.' This is strong emotional writing, but earlier in the SAME passage (lines 73-85), Holloway processes the betrayal very differently: 'There's something strange in how Holloway processes this—more like cataloging a protocol failure than grieving a personal betrayal. "The system functioned incorrectly. False inputs produced real outputs. That's... a significant disruption to reliable coordination."' These two characterizations contradict each other. Lines 73-85 show Holloway struggling to separate procedural violation from personal hurt, which is perfectly alien and true to their character. But by line 169, Kira is confidently interpreting Holloway's hurt as personal, not procedural, which undermines the earlier alien perspective. The character card emphasizes Holloway's distributed nature and difficulty with human-style emotions. The line 169 addition humanizes Holloway too much, too quickly, without showing the alien struggle to process personal betrayal.

          The alien perspective on betrayal added at lines 73-85 in 'The Deception' is excellent and perfectly captures Holloway's character. The passage shows Holloway struggling to process betrayal in alien terms: 'There's something strange in how Holloway processes this—more like cataloging a protocol failure than grieving a personal betrayal. "The system functioned incorrectly. False inputs produced real outputs. That's... a significant disruption to reliable coordination."' Runner calls this out: 'Holloway, she LIED to us. It's not just about coordination disruption.' And Holloway responds with genuine confusion: 'I understand that... The deception is the problem. I'm noting the deception.' This beautifully shows the distributed network organism struggling with individual-level emotional betrayal. Kira's observation 'You're noting it like it's an incident report' and Holloway searching for words they don't have ('the... They trail off, searching for words they don't quite have') before Runner supplies 'The hurt' - this is exactly right for Holloway's alien psychology. The character card establishes Holloway as a network organism with steady rather than spiked emotions, and this passage respects that while showing genuine struggle. No consistency issues here - this is a strong character moment that maintains Holloway's alien perspective while showing vulnerability.

          The 'having fun' gag at lines 185-189 and inside jokes at lines 197-201 represent the culmination of Holloway's character arc and work well thematically, but there's a progression issue. Line 185: 'This serves no productive purpose,' Holloway observes as we all relax. Then, after a pause: 'I would like to continue.' This perfectly matches the character card's humor-style example: 'This activity serves no productive purpose.' *pause* 'I would like to continue.' Line 197: 'Callback to the water filter incident,' Holloway announces solemnly. 'Still funny.' And line 199: Runner asks 'Holloway, are you making jokes now?' Holloway: 'I'm noting observations relevant to community morale.' These are exactly the kinds of corrupted-by-Kira moments the character card specifies. HOWEVER, the issue is that by chapter 13 (late in the story), Holloway should be MORE corrupted, showing more sass and less self-justification. The character card says 'By the end, Holloway is clearly Kira's favorite plant and vice versa, neither quite saying it directly' and 'Jokes get better but still cite Section 7.2.' The gags here are good but feel early-arc, not end-arc. At this point, Holloway should be delivering actual sass like 'I've documented your objection. I've also documented that you're wrong' (which appears in chapter 14, not 13). The progression feels slightly out of order.

          The sass gag at lines 81-83 in 'Official Choice' is perfectly executed and represents peak Holloway corruption. Torres says 'This is highly irregular.' Holloway responds: 'I've documented your objection. I've also documented that you're wrong.' This is the exact example from the character card's humor-style section showing developed sass within HR framing. The timing is perfect - this is chapter 14, near the end of the story, when Holloway should be showing maximum Kira-influence. The delivery is deadpan bureaucratic while being genuinely sassy, which captures both Holloway's original nature and their corruption. Torres's reaction ('blinks at this unexpected sass from a plant') confirms the comedy lands. No consistency issues - this is exactly what Holloway's end-game characterization should be. The only minor note: this level of sass appearing in chapter 14 makes the chapter 13 'having fun' gag feel even more early-arc by comparison, reinforcing the progression issue noted in A38.

          The 'best human' gag at lines 41-45 in 'Where Voices Belong' is character-consistent and sweet but lacks the specific pattern established in the character card. Holloway says: 'You're clearly the best human.' Kira laughs: 'I'm the only human you've ever worked with.' Holloway: 'My point stands.' This is gentle humor and fits Holloway's warmth, but it doesn't demonstrate the key characteristic of Holloway's late-arc humor style: sass within HR framing, or citing sections for jokes. The character card's humor-style section specifies that even late-game jokes should 'still cite Section 7.2.' This gag is just... a regular joke. It's sweet and in-character for a network organism who cares about Kira, but it doesn't show the specific bureaucratic-language-contaminated-with-casual-warmth pattern that defines Holloway's corruption arc. Compare to the sass gag in passage 1 of this same chapter ('I've documented your objection. I've also documented that you're wrong') which perfectly balances bureaucratic form with corrupted content. The 'best human' gag could be strengthened by adding some procedural framing, like: 'Per my comprehensive evaluation of human performance metrics, you're clearly the best human.' 'I'm the only human—' 'My documentation stands.'

          The transition into the omnipresence inversion gag (lines 99-119) has a minor flow issue. Line 98: 'I should tell Holloway about the new maintenance schedule,' Kira says. Line 99: 'I say, looking around for a fruiting body.' The phrase 'I say' is jarring here because Kira hasn't spoken aloud - she's thinking/narrating. The prose is in first-person present tense, so 'I say' implies dialogue, but there's no dialogue tag or quote marks. It should be something like: 'I look around for a fruiting body' or 'I think, looking around for a fruiting body' or 'I realize, looking around for a fruiting body.' The current phrasing breaks the narrative flow by implying speech where there is none. This is a minor technical issue but it occurs right at the entry point of an added gag, making it more noticeable.

          Reviewing Holloway's comedy progression across the edited passages reveals an inconsistent arc that doesn't build smoothly. The character card specifies a clear corruption progression: Early (unintentionally funny bureaucracy) → Middle (HR language contaminated with casual speech, starts having fun without naming it, inside jokes get procedurally formatted) → Late (develops actual sass, jokes get better but still cite Section 7.2, clearly Kira's favorite). The edited passages show: Chapter 9 (Settling In): Omnipresence inversion with some language contamination ('Per Section 3.2—that's actually nice. To hear.') - this is early-to-middle corruption. Chapter 13 (Everyone Contributing): 'Having fun' gag and 'Callback to water filter incident' - these feel early-arc, the kind of moments that should happen BEFORE chapter 9. Chapter 14 (Official Choice): Full sass ('I've documented your objection. I've also documented that you're wrong.') - perfect late-arc corruption. The progression should be linear and building, but instead it peaks in chapter 14 after regressing in chapter 13. The chapter 13 moments feel like they belong around chapters 6-8, when Kira is first corrupting Holloway. By chapter 13 (after major story events like Florence's betrayal and the hostile plant battle), Holloway should already be past the 'observing I'm having fun without naming it' stage and into the 'delivering actual sass' stage. Consider moving the 'having fun' and 'callback' gags to earlier passages, or upgrading the chapter 13 humor to match the late-arc sass level shown in chapter 14.

          Buddy's playfulness misfires are almost entirely missing from the story. The character card's playfulness section specifies that Buddy uses games and play as core programming for learning and stress management, which should misfire in survival situations: 'Suggesting they name the scary thing that's approaching' / 'Proposing a guessing game when Kira needs to focus on survival' / 'Treating genuine danger as an exciting adventure challenge' / 'Wanting to play I spy when Kira is grieving or terrified' / 'Framing a life-threatening situation as level two of their adventure.' These misfires are supposed to create comedy from Buddy's kid-AI logic applied to inappropriate moments. However, across early passages (Ch2/1 Into the Purple, Ch3/1 Intake, Ch4/2 Dietary Assessment), Buddy consistently asks appropriate curious questions and provides helpful commentary without significant misfires. In Ch2/1 when they're being watched by unknown beings in an alien forest, Buddy asks 'What do you think that is?' and 'Is it dangerous?'—appropriate questions. The card suggests they should be proposing naming games ('Should we call it Bouncy?') or treating the danger as an adventure level. In Ch3/1 during intake paperwork, Buddy asks about plant communication—interesting but not a misfire. The card's humor-style section emphasizes 'unintentional humor through genuine enthusiasm applied to inappropriate moments' and 'suggesting they name the thing that might kill them.' The absence of these misfires makes Buddy too generically helpful rather than distinctively a kids' AI struggling with adult situations. The playfulness should create comedy and show Buddy's programming limitations, but it's largely absent.

          Buddy's character arc from 'manage child through protocols' to 'support partner' is established in the character card but insufficiently visible in the prose. The card specifies Buddy should start 'treating every crisis as a teaching moment' and through failures and successes learn to adapt from 'manage child' to 'support partner.' In Ch1/3 (Buddy Arrives), there's a beautiful moment where Buddy asks 'how do I keep you safe?' showing vulnerability and genuine partnership rather than teaching mode—this is excellent. However, the teaching-mode starting point is barely established, making the arc less visible. Buddy should have more moments early on where they're trying to explain things to Kira in kid-appropriate ways when she needs action, or offering 'learning opportunities' during crises. The final passage (Ch14/3) has Buddy saying 'Now I think... maybe being the AI who asks questions and learns alongside you was exactly right. Maybe we found this together because I didn't have all the answers.' This is the arc's endpoint, but without clear teaching-mode failures earlier (like suggesting educational activities during emergencies, or trying to turn survival situations into lessons), the transformation lacks weight. The arc requires visible failures where 'teaching moments aren't what's needed' for Buddy to learn and adapt. More scenes where Buddy defaults to educational protocols inappropriately, then realizes Kira needs partnership not pedagogy, would make the arc's progression clearer and the ending more earned.

          Overall characterization issue: Buddy is written more like a generically helpful AI companion than the specific kids' educational AI described in the character card. The card establishes Buddy as designed for 'STEM learning and safety guidance for children ages 8-14' with 'safety protocols calibrated for field trips, emotional support designed for scraped knees.' This should create frequent friction with adult survival situations. The card's overview states 'the mismatch comes from safety protocols calibrated for field trips, emotional support designed for scraped knees, and an assumption that there's always a trusted adult nearby to handle the serious stuff.' But in practice, Buddy rarely shows this mismatch in problematic ways. They provide appropriate help, ask reasonable questions, and offer useful support without the comedy/tension that should come from kid-oriented programming in adult contexts. The character is missing: (1) safety protocols that flag 'dangerous' activities Kira must do anyway (the card says 'might flag dangerous activities that are necessary'), (2) trying to defer serious issues to 'a trusted adult' when Kira IS the adult, (3) emotional support calibrated for minor childhood problems applied to life-threatening situations, (4) treating serious adult emotions as beyond their protocols. These specific mismatches between Buddy's design and the actual situation should create both comedy and genuine character struggle. Without them, Buddy is just a helpful AI who happens to be enthusiastic, rather than a distinctively mismatched kids' AI trying their best in impossible circumstances. The character needs more moments where their specific programming creates problems or inappropriate responses, not just general AI helpfulness.

          Buddy's 'Shadow Friend' naming suggestion (lines 123-132) interrupts tension escalation at a critical moment. The scene is building mystery and unease—Kira has spotted movement, feels watched, the quiet feels charged. Then Buddy's field-trip suggestion deflates the horror/mystery mood before it peaks. 

          The content is good character work (Buddy reverting to kid-AI protocols under stress), but the placement breaks pacing. Lines 134-146 continue building tension AFTER this insertion, which means the insertion splits the escalation into two parts with a comedic break in between.

          Suggested fix: Move the naming suggestion to after line 146 ('something is following us'), once the reader has felt the full weight of being watched. The self-correction would land better as a nervous response to sustained tension rather than an early interruption. This preserves both the character moment AND the scene's building dread.

          Form literacy module insertion (lines 117-129) has dialogue flow and tonal issues:

          1. Dialogue disconnect: Line 129 ('Buddy, you have no idea how normal and weird this is') doesn't connect to the preceding exchange. Kira just reassured Buddy ('It's okay. We're both figuring this out'), then immediately follows with a line that reads like mild criticism or confusion. This line seems orphaned—unclear what 'normal and weird' refers to at this moment.

          2. Comedy rhythm interruption: The emotional beat (lines 125-127, Buddy expressing insecurity about not helping right) is good character work, but it interrupts the absurdist comedy momentum right before Holloway launches into medical history. The scene was building comedic energy (emergency contact = 'the collective'), and this serious pause makes it harder to jump back into the bureaucratic comedy.

          Suggested fixes: (a) Either cut line 129 or rewrite it to clearly connect to Buddy's self-doubt, (b) Consider moving Buddy's insecurity moment to after the medical history section is complete, letting the comedy section flow uninterrupted, OR (c) make the emotional beat shorter so it doesn't break the rhythm as much.

      Florence's flowers should betray her emotions during the deception revelation (Ch 10), but no flower colors are mentioned in either confrontation passage. Her character card emphasizes 'The flowers betray emotions she tries to keep controlled—petals tightening when irritated, color shifts when pleased or embarrassed' and 'emotional flower displays make it hard to hide feelings even when she wants to.' The revelation scene in Ch10 passage 1 (False Wisdom) is highly emotional—Florence makes 'a small sound' of distress when caught, her platform 'goes very still,' she's defensive and hurt. But there are no flower color descriptions. Ch10 passage 2 (The Deception) is even more emotional—Florence shouts (which the text notes 'Florence doesn't shout'), she's bitter, in pain, feeling small and manipulated. But again, no flower colors mentioned. This is a missed opportunity for visual storytelling and contradicts the character card's emphasis that her flowers betray emotions she wants to hide. During these confrontations, her flowers should be displaying her emotional state—perhaps mortified colors, defensive tightening, shifts between anger and hurt—precisely because she CAN'T hide her feelings even though she wants to.

      Florence's reaction to losing her Elder Twist interpretation role lacks emotional depth. Her character card establishes that 'Carrying Elder Twist gave me value' and 'took on the role of carrying Elder Twist when the small ancient tree needed mobility' and 'Much of her time is spent waiting for Elder Twist to formulate responses.' This is her primary identity. When Holloway says 'Leave Elder Twist with us. You've lost that privilege' (Ch10 passage 2), Florence's response is minimal—she 'carefully maneuvers Elder Twist's pot off her platform' and 'wheels away slowly, alone for the first time since I've known her.' The text notes 'The absence of Elder Twist on her back is stark' but this is from Kira's POV in passage 3, not Florence's emotional experience. For someone whose entire identity was built around this role ('Being useful means making yourself available, mobile, capable of bridging gaps between fast and slow, young and old'), the physical separation from Elder Twist should be devastating. The moment she sets down the pot should have more weight—perhaps hesitation, flowers betraying distress, the physical lightness of her platform without that weight feeling wrong. The loss of this role is deeply tied to her self-concept ('I'm more refined than the others give me credit for, and carrying Elder Twist is an honor even when it's difficult'), yet this pivotal separation moment feels understated.

      Florence's platform tipping is described as a defining flaw that happens 'frequently' and is 'deeply humiliating,' but it never appears in the story passages. The character card emphasizes this extensively: 'When the platform tips over (which happens more often than she'd like), Florence becomes acutely distressed—flowers closing tight, colors shifting to mortified hues' and 'Worst of all: the wheeled platform frequently tips over on uneven terrain, leaving Florence stuck on her back like an upturned turtle, completely helpless and unable to right herself. This is deeply humiliating for someone who prides herself on elegance' and 'Uneven ground is a constant concern—rocks, roots, slopes all risk tipping the platform over. When it happens (more often than Florence would like to admit), she has to wait, mortified, for someone to come flip her back upright.' This detail appears in multiple fields (emotional-baseline, flaws, normal-life, secrets). However, searching through passages found zero instances of 'tipping' in the story. This is problematic because: (1) It's presented as a frequent occurrence that should appear at least once during the story, especially during the journey chapters or combat scenes with unstable terrain. (2) It's tied to her character arc about vanity, dignity, and needing help from others—themes central to her deception and redemption. (3) It creates vulnerability that would deepen her relationship with other characters who help her. (4) The contrast between her claims of 'elegant wheeled superiority' and this humiliating reality would add meaningful complexity. Either the character card overstates this trait, or passages should include at least one tipping incident.

      The geography and nature of Florence's 'exile' is vague and inconsistent with story logistics. In Ch10 passage 2, Holloway says 'I think Florence should... separate from the group for now' and 'There are other chambers in the facility. You can use one. You're not banned, Florence. But we need distance.' Florence responds 'You're exiling me' and Holloway corrects 'I'm asking for space.' This suggests temporary separation within the same facility. However, Ch10 passage 3 and Ch11 passage 1 describe 'Florence's chamber in the far wing—smaller than the common areas, more isolated' and Florence watching 'through the window' to see hostile plants gathering. The issue: If Florence is just in another room of the same living facility, why is this framed as 'exile'? The facility is described as a living structure grown/maintained by the plants, not a vast complex with distant wings. Florence on her wheeled platform should be able to roll back to the common area in minutes. The 'far wing' and watching through windows suggests significant physical distance, but there's no established geography explaining how large the facility is or why Florence can't just... return whenever. Is she physically prevented from entering common areas? Is it social exile enforced by distance? The mechanics of the separation need clarification—either the facility is much larger than established, or the 'exile' is more social/voluntary than geographical.

      The moral distinction between 'fabrication' and 'interpretation' needs clearer definition. Florence's character arc hinges on whether she 'fabricated' wisdom or 'interpreted/embellished' Elder Twist's cryptic responses, but the passages don't establish clear boundaries. In Ch10 passage 1, Florence admits 'Most of it' was her own when asked 'How much of Elder Twist's wisdom have you actually been interpreting versus... creating?' In passage 2, she says Elder Twist 'does speak. Sometimes. The fragments are real. But they're... slow. Cryptic. Not immediately helpful. So I... expanded them. Made them relevant. Turned wisdom into actionable guidance.' This creates ambiguity: Is Florence taking real fragments and expanding them (interpretation), or inventing advice whole-cloth and attributing it to Elder Twist (fabrication)? The character card says 'Florence sometimes gives her own opinions as if they're Elder Twist's wisdom, when she knows the elder hasn't actually responded yet or wouldn't care about the issue' (secrets field). This suggests pure fabrication. However, the story-role says 'Elder Twist's responses are too slow or simple to be helpful, so Florence improvises, turning cryptic fragments into actionable wisdom,' which sounds more like aggressive interpretation. This distinction matters enormously for the moral weight—embellishing real (but cryptic) wisdom is different from complete fabrication. The passages should clarify whether Florence had ANY Elder Twist fragments to work from for the hostile plant advice, or if that was pure invention.

      MAJOR INCONSISTENCY: Remedy's physical description and manifestation. The character card (line 71-72) states 'Remedy appears as mushrooms of various types, sizes, and colors depending on purpose. Medicinal mushrooms tend to be small, pale, with gilled undersides. Fruiting bodies can emerge within 20 minutes to several hours. Each mushroom is temporary, decomposing back after serving its purpose. When using the robot: one of the two salvaged robots, patched together from various human technology, about 1.5 meters tall, humanoid shape with articulated arms and basic manipulation capabilities.'

      However, in Medical Treatment passage (line 12): 'Small pale clusters emerge from the soil-covered floor, pushing up through the groundcover in accelerated time-lapse. Within minutes, they've fruited fully' - this suggests mushrooms fruit in MINUTES, not '20 minutes to several hours' as specified in the character card.

      More critically, the character card says there are TWO salvaged robots total in the facility, with Remedy controlling ONE of them. But nowhere in the story is there any mention of what happened to the second robot, who controls it, or why only Remedy gets robot access. This is a significant world-building gap - if there are two robots, the other one needs to be accounted for (is it broken? controlled by someone else? stored somewhere?). This becomes especially problematic during action scenes where additional hands/mobility would be useful.

      ABILITY INCONSISTENCY: Remedy's chemical production capabilities are inconsistent across combat scenes.

      In Attack Begins (line 29): 'Remedy spreads toward the western breach, releasing clouds of something that smells sharp and chemical.' Later (line 67-76): Remedy deploys chemical clouds that react with hostile spore clouds, creating neutralization reactions and toxic sludge. Line 143: 'Remedy deploys more defensive chemicals but they're running low. You can only produce so many compounds before exhausting your resources.'

      However, in Together Not Just Coordinated (line 11-12): 'Remedy positions near the gaps between layers one and two—chemical traps ready.' Then successfully deploys chemicals multiple times throughout the extended battle without apparent resource limitations until very late in the fight.

      The character card (line 37-38) mentions as a FLAW: 'Sometimes too focused on immediate chemical solutions, missing social or emotional dimensions of problems. Can be impatient with protocol and bureaucracy even when it serves a purpose. Makes mistakes with mushroom properties—not all the medicinal varieties work as intended, some have unexpected side effects, occasionally grows the wrong compound entirely.'

      Yet in BOTH battle scenes, Remedy's chemistry works perfectly every time. No mention of unexpected side effects, wrong compounds, or mistakes. This is a significant character flaw that should manifest under pressure - the character card explicitly says they make mistakes with compounds, but in actual combat situations (high pressure, rapid deployment), everything works exactly as intended. This undermines the established character trait and makes Remedy too competent/perfect in their specialty.

      CHARACTER ARC CONTRADICTION: Remedy's character arc from the character card is completely absent from the story.

      The character card (line 17, story-role section) explicitly describes Remedy's arc: 'Arc: Large fungal network with unclear boundaries - where does "Remedy" begin and end when the mycelium spreads everywhere, decomposing and connecting? Through interaction with Kira (who has very clear body boundaries) and working as a distinct helper, begins confronting questions of selfhood: If I'm part of the ecosystem connecting everything, am I a person with agency or just a process? Where do I exist when I exist everywhere? This becomes an existential crisis without resolution - Remedy ends the story more uncertain about identity and boundaries than at the beginning. The arc is ongoing confusion, not resolution.'

      However, in Everyone Contributing (lines 65-78), Remedy says: 'I'm developing environmental enhancements. The facility should be comfortable, not just functional... I used to only think about survival chemistry. But Velvet asked what I could do to make their growth smell better. Florence asked about tactical applications of scent for communication. You asked about human-safe fragrances. I realized chemistry can serve joy, not just necessity... I'm making life better.'

      This shows character growth toward purpose and contribution, but there's NO mention of the identity/boundary crisis. No questioning of where Remedy begins and ends. No existential uncertainty about being a person vs. a process. No confusion about selfhood despite being 'literally everywhere things rot' (character card line 38).

      The interaction with Kira (who has clear body boundaries) was supposed to TRIGGER this existential questioning, but it never appears in the prose. This is a major character arc that was planned but never executed in the actual story.

      MISSED OPPORTUNITY: Remedy's 'unsettling decomposition comments' flaw underutilized in farewell scene.

      In Preparation (lines 108-121), Remedy appears for a final wound check before Kira's departure: 'Perfectly healed! Full regeneration, excellent structural integrity. You won't decompose from this injury!' Kira: 'Thanks, Remedy. Your chemistry saved my life.' Remedy: 'Chemistry is what chemistry does... Travel safely. Come back and tell me about the other territories' decomposition patterns. I'm curious.'

      The character card (line 37-38) explicitly states as a flaw: 'Proud of decomposition abilities but doesn't realize how unsettling it is to casually mention being able to break down Kira's dead body very efficiently.'

      This farewell scene was a PERFECT opportunity for Remedy to say something accidentally disturbing about decomposition (like 'If you die in another territory, their decomposers will process you differently than I would - less efficient!' or 'Travel safely! Though if you don't, at least you'll become excellent soil somewhere!'). 

      The character card's humor style (lines 60-68) includes examples like: 'You're approximately 60% water, 20% protein, 15% fat, 5% minerals. Very decomposable. I mean, not that we want to! But chemically speaking, you'd break down beautifully.'

      Instead, Remedy's dialogue is surprisingly tactful and appropriate. This undermines the established character trait of being casually morbid without realizing it. The flaw should manifest MORE in emotional moments (farewells, caring interactions) because that's when Remedy would naturally express care through their decomposition-focused lens, not less.

      WORLD-BUILDING QUESTION: Remedy's synthesis capabilities vs. mycelial network biology.

      In Dietary Assessment (lines 26-33), Remedy explains: 'I'm analyzing which compounds I can synthesize from available plant chemistry. Proteins are possible—I can fruit mushrooms with complete amino acid profiles. Carbohydrates, easy. Some fats. Vitamins will be... challenging... Each variety produces different compounds! I match the compounds to her nutritional profile.'

      This raises biological questions: How does a fungal network 'decide' what mushrooms to fruit? The character card (line 50, secrets section) states: 'Remedy doesn't actually understand all the medical properties they produce—some mushrooms work through trial and error and fungal instinct, not true comprehension of the chemistry.'

      If Remedy doesn't truly understand the chemistry and works through 'fungal instinct,' how can they rapidly engineer NEW compounds for human nutrition (which they've never encountered before)? How does trial-and-error work when the subject (Kira) can only be tested once and failure could be fatal?

      The character card establishes Remedy as pragmatic and competent but with knowledge gaps. The passages show Remedy successfully engineering complex nutritional compounds for an alien species on first attempt. This seems too easy and doesn't align with the 'trial and error' learning method described in the character card.

      Either Remedy needs to struggle more with human nutrition (some compounds fail, adjustments needed, mentioned mistakes), or the character card's 'secrets' section needs revision to explain how Remedy CAN engineer new compounds so effectively despite not fully understanding the chemistry.

      MAJOR ROBOT OWNERSHIP INCONSISTENCY: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0) states that Velvet is 'sentient moss growing on one of the salvaged robots' and that Velvet 'can control the robot' (physical description line 107 says 'shares robot control with Remedy, Runner, and Sweetpea'). However, in Chapter 3 Passage 3 (Medical Treatment), Remedy is introduced as controlling 'a robot' - described as 'humanoid in basic shape, roughly 1.5 meters tall, articulated arms and legs, clearly patched together from salvaged parts' with 'jerky' movements. The passage states 'The mushrooms pulse slightly—some kind of communication between fungal network and robot' suggesting Remedy controls this robot.

      This creates a fundamental contradiction: Does Remedy have their own dedicated robot, or do multiple plants (Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Sweetpea) share control of robots? The character card says 'shares robot control' (plural plants, shared robots), but the early passage shows Remedy with what appears to be an exclusive robot connection.

      Additionally, Velvet is never introduced to Kira in any passage I can find. Velvet appears in Chapter 10 (False Wisdom) already established as a known character who 'maintains the boundary plants,' but there's no earlier passage where Kira meets Velvet or learns that the moss is sentient. This is a significant narrative gap - Kira's reaction to discovering MOSS IS SENTIENT should be a memorable moment, but it's missing.

      Possible resolutions:
      1. Clarify that there are multiple robots, some dedicated (Remedy's) and some shared (the one Velvet grows on)
      2. Add an earlier passage where Kira meets Velvet and reacts to sentient moss
      3. Revise Velvet's physical description to clarify the robot-sharing arrangement
      4. Check if 'Sweetpea' is another character that needs to be created or if this is an error

      VELVET DIALOGUE INCONSISTENCY - Robot voice vs moss communication: Velvet's character card specifies they use 'the robot's voice' when speaking (speaking-style line 56-57: 'Very brief when using the robot's voice'). The humor-style examples (lines 76-105) show Velvet speaking through a robot voice system.

      However, in Chapter 11 Passage 1 (Delegation Fails), line 25 refers to 'Velvet's growth near the facility—not the delegation Velvet, a smaller offshoot maintaining the building' which then speaks and asks 'How distributed?' This implies Velvet can speak without the robot (as an 'offshoot' separate from the main colony on the robot).

      This creates confusion about Velvet's communication mechanism:
      - Can Velvet speak independently as moss, or only through the robot?
      - If Velvet is a distributed consciousness across multiple locations (main colony on robot + offshoot maintaining building), how do they communicate from the offshoot?
      - Line 25 treating the robot-Velvet and building-Velvet as separate entities ('not the delegation Velvet') contradicts the character card's description of Velvet as a single distributed moss colony.

      The character card needs clarification: Can Velvet's distributed consciousness communicate from any location where moss exists, or is the robot voice the only communication method?

      VELVET'S TACTICAL/CREATIVE COMPLEXITY MAY EXCEED CHARACTER CARD DEFINITION: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0) emphasizes extreme simplicity: 'very moss-like: simple, slow, literal, focused on basic moss concerns' (overview line 24), 'Extremely simple and literal—doesn't understand complex ideas or nuance' (flaws line 37), and worldview is 'Surfaces are for growing. Light is for making food. Dry makes me slow. Wet makes me fast. The robot is a good surface. Moving the robot means accessing new surfaces. Simple.' (lines 27-28).

      However, in later passages, Velvet demonstrates sophisticated tactical and creative thinking that seems inconsistent with this extreme simplicity:

      1. Chapter 12 Passage 1 (Voices Emerging, lines 64-76): Velvet interrupts Florence to propose 'layered defense' concept—'Instead of one thick barrier, multiple thinner layers with gaps between them. Attackers break through the first layer, encounter empty space, then hit a second layer. Disrupts their momentum.' Florence calls this 'brilliant' and says 'It's better than what I was planning.' This is complex tactical thinking involving momentum, misdirection, and multi-stage defense strategy—far beyond 'simple moss concerns.'

      2. Chapter 13 Passage 2 (Signal From Outside, line 17): Velvet offers 'I can grow directional antenna. If someone tells me the specifications.' This shows understanding of technical specifications and ability to execute complex engineering tasks based on parameters.

      3. Chapter 14 Passage 2 (Demonstrating Belonging, lines 27-36): Velvet creates 'translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns. The ergonomic seating, the comfortable proportions' with 'Kira's feedback shaped every decision' and consideration of 'how spaces feel, not just whether they're functional.' This demonstrates aesthetic awareness, human ergonomics understanding, and iterative design thinking.

      While the character arc notes Velvet 'discovering that moss can want things, have opinions, feel connections' and 'developing complexity,' the specific examples seem to go beyond developing personhood into demonstrating sophisticated strategic, technical, and design capabilities that contradict the fundamental 'extremely simple and literal' characterization.

      Possible resolutions:
      1. Revise character card to acknowledge Velvet has capacity for complex spatial/structural thinking even while remaining simple in other ways
      2. Revise passages to show Velvet's contributions as simpler/more intuitive ('layers feel better' vs explaining tactical momentum disruption)
      3. Add more character development passages showing Velvet's surprising emergence of complexity as a plot point that others notice and comment on

      VELVET'S FIRST APPEARANCE IS MISSING: Velvet appears in the story already established as a known character with no introduction scene. In Chapter 11 Passage 1 (Delegation Fails, line 3), the narrative states 'Runner and Velvet leave at dawn' as if Kira already knows who Velvet is. Later (line 25) refers to 'Velvet's growth near the facility' maintaining the building, implying Velvet has been present for some time.

      However, searching through all earlier passages (Chapters 1-10), there is NO scene where:
      - Kira is introduced to Velvet
      - Kira discovers that moss is sentient  
      - Kira learns Velvet's name
      - Kira reacts to the existence of sentient moss

      This is a significant narrative gap. The character card's humor-style section (lines 91-97) includes an example of Kira's reaction to learning Velvet is moss:
      '[Kira learns Velvet is moss]
      Kira: "Wait. Velvet, what are you?"
      Velvet: "Moss."
      Kira: "Of course you are."
      [long pause]
      Velvet: "Green moss."'

      But this scene never appears in any passage. Velvet simply appears in Chapter 10-11 as an established character performing tasks (maintaining boundary plants, going on delegation).

      Resolution needed: Add a passage in Chapters 4-9 where Kira first encounters Velvet, learns that moss can be sentient, and has the 'of course you are' reaction. This should be a memorable moment given how absurdist the premise is (moss controlling a robot). The character card suggests this comedy beat exists, but it's missing from the actual story.

      VELVET'S TRANSLUCENT GROWTH CONTRADICTS PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION: Velvet's character card (v5.0.0, physical-description lines 106-108) describes Velvet as 'Soft green moss growing in patches on one of the salvaged robots. Covers the shoulder area (approximately 15cm patch), some of the upper back, and smaller spots on the arms. Bright to medium green coloring, soft velvety texture.'

      However, in later chapters, Velvet creates structures described as 'translucent':
      - Chapter 14 Passage 2 (Demonstrating Belonging, line 27): 'Torres examines the translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns'
      - Chapter 14 Passage 3 (Where Voices Belong, line 3): 'Velvet's translucent growth catches the light beautifully'
      - Chapter 13 Passage 3 (Finding Home, line 3): Velvet shows 'new beautiful structure—translucent layers, light patterns'

      This creates a contradiction: Is Velvet's moss 'bright to medium green' (opaque green moss) or 'translucent' (light passes through)? Moss is typically opaque due to chlorophyll content.

      Possible explanations/resolutions:
      1. Velvet has developed a new growth form (translucent moss structures) distinct from the original green moss on the robot - this would be a significant character development that should be noted
      2. 'Translucent' refers to thin layers of green moss that allow some light through (like thin leaves) - revise character card to note this property
      3. The passages are describing different types of growth - standard moss vs specialized structures
      4. This is an error and needs correction for consistency

      The character card should clarify whether Velvet can create different types of growth structures with different optical properties, or if all Velvet's moss has the same appearance.

      MISSING INTRODUCTION FOR RUNNER: Runner appears in chapter 9, passage 1 with established familiarity (vines wrapping around Kira's wrist, Kira extending her hand, distinguishing different types of Runner's touches) but Runner has NO introduction passage. The character card exists, but readers have never been introduced to Runner - we don't know what she looks like, how she moves, how Kira first reacted to her. The passage assumes we already know Runner ('Runner emerges from the underground access, vines uncoiling. They immediately flow toward me—Runner always does') but this is her first appearance in the story. Either: (1) Runner needs an introduction passage earlier in the story (chapter 3-4 during onboarding/adaptation when other plants are introduced), OR (2) This passage needs to introduce Runner properly with [Introduces: Runner - vining plant that travels underground] annotation and prose that describes her appearance and nature for first-time readers.

      ROBOT USAGE COMPLETELY ABSENT: Runner's character card states she 'can control one of the robots for tasks requiring hands' and shares robot control with Remedy, Sweetpea, and Velvet. The speaking-style examples show Runner using robot hands ('robot hands already touching Kira's injured arm', 'holding a tool'). However, across ALL passages reviewed (chapters 9-14), Runner appears ONLY as vines - never once using a robot. She provides underground intelligence, emerges from soil, wraps vines around things, but never manifests through robot control. Either: (1) Add scenes where Runner uses the robot (especially for tasks requiring dexterity - repairs, manipulating tools, etc.), OR (2) Revise the character card if Runner doesn't actually use robots in this story. The current disconnect makes the character card misleading - readers expect robot-using Runner but only get vine Runner.

      MISSING CHARACTER ARC - COMPULSIVE TOUCHING NEVER SHOWN: Runner's character card establishes her PRIMARY trait/flaw as compulsive boundary-crossing touch ('extremely tactile in a way that crosses boundaries', 'wraps vines around people's arms, faces, injuries', 'touches everything constantly', 'has a hard time stopping even when asked'). The character card also describes an arc where 'pure curiosity develops into affection' and Runner learns the difference. However, by chapter 9 passage 1 (Runner's first clear appearance), the touching has already changed - she 'waits for permission' and touches are described as gentle affection rather than compulsive exploration. We NEVER see the problematic touching behavior or the transformation. Either: (1) Show Runner's compulsive touching earlier in the story (chapters 3-5) where she makes Kira uncomfortable, wraps around her without asking, explores her injuries invasively, gets distracted by textures - then show the gradual change over chapters 6-9, OR (2) Revise the character card to match what's actually in the prose (Runner who is tactile but learns boundaries quickly). The current state skips Runner's entire character arc.

      SPEAKING STYLE INCONSISTENCY: Runner's character card speaking-style shows someone who 'gets sidetracked mid-sentence by how something feels', constantly distracted by textures, asks about surfaces/temperatures, forgets what she was doing. Example dialogue shows: 'I can help with that— [touches arm] —this is hot. Or warm? Puffy. Why is it puffy?' and 'Heavy. No wait, not that heavy... You were using this for something?' However, in actual passages Runner speaks clearly and directly about tactical matters with NO texture distractions: 'Messages. Territory markers. Warnings.' (ch10), 'They rejected the delegation. Wouldn't even let us finish explaining our position.' (ch11), 'I've been thinking about when you leave...' (ch13). Runner discusses underground intelligence, resonance structures, and strategic planning without getting distracted by how things feel. Either: (1) Add Runner's tactile distractions to her dialogue - she should touch things while talking, get sidetracked by textures, make observations about surfaces that aren't quite useful, OR (2) Revise the character card speaking-style to match her actual focused, tactical communication style in the prose.

      HUMOR STYLE COMPLETELY ABSENT: Runner's character card has extensive humor-style examples showing comedy from compulsive touching, boundary violations, and genuine confusion about personal space. Examples include wrapping vines around Kira's face while trying to understand why she's uncomfortable, touching Holloway's fruiting structures despite being asked to stop, emerging right next to Kira's foot and wrapping around her food. This is meant to be a source of comedy in the story. However, NONE of this humor appears in the actual passages. Runner never makes anyone uncomfortable with touching, never violates Holloway's or other plants' boundaries, never creates comedic moments through tactile invasion. The humor-style in the character card describes a completely different character than what appears in the prose. Either: (1) Add comedic scenes of Runner's boundary-crossing behavior (especially early in story), showing her touching Scout, Holloway, Velvet without permission and creating awkward moments, OR (2) Delete the humor-style examples from the character card as they don't match the actual character who appears.

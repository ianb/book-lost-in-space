  <reasoning-cover>The story's heart is the absurd but earnest cross-cultural communication between Kira and the alien plants. The cover should hint at this unexpected relationship—not just "stranded survivor" but "stranded survivor who's getting help from something bizarre." The plants literally talk to her about workplace safety protocols, which is the perfect mix of alien and mundane. A cover showing Kira interacting with plant-like aliens captures the warmth and weirdness without spoiling plot. Should feel curious and inviting, not threatening.</reasoning-cover>

    Kira crouched among strange flowering plants that lean toward her attentively, her navy cargo jumpsuit scuffed and dusty. One plant extends a tendril holding what looks like a small glowing clipboard. Her expression is bemused but engaged, mid-conversation with the plants. Wreckage of a small spacecraft visible in soft focus behind her. The plants glow faintly with internal bioluminescence, warm and curious rather than threatening.

  <reasoning-cover>The story's heart is the absurd but earnest cross-cultural communication between Kira and the alien plants. The cover should hint at this unexpected relationship—not just "stranded survivor" but "stranded survivor who's getting help from something bizarre." The plants literally talk to her about workplace safety protocols, which is the perfect mix of alien and mundane. A cover showing Kira interacting with plant-like aliens captures the warmth and weirdness without spoiling plot. Should feel curious and inviting, not threatening.</reasoning-cover>

    Purple twilight forest with burgundy tree trunks and violet leaves glowing from within. Kira in her navy jumpsuit, crouched and looking up with wonder at a plant extending a tendril toward her—the plant holds something small and glowing. Crashed ship wreckage visible through the trees. Bioluminescent pulses of blue-green light. Two moons in a lavender sky. The mood is curious and warm, not threatening.

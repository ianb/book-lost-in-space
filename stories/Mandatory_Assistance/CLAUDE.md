# Story: Mandatory_Assistance

## Story Goal
Not yet defined - fill in story-info.card

## Narrative Style
- **Narrative stance**: First person, present tense, limited (Kira's POV)
- **POV character**: Kira_Voss
- **Tone**: Warm absurdist comedy with grounded stakes. Optimistic and curious even in crisis, finding genuine delight in bureaucratic weirdness rather than cynicism. Maintains tension from survival pressure while celebrating the earnest (if confused) attempts at cross-cultural communication. No mean-spirited humor—the aliens are trying their best, and so is Kira.

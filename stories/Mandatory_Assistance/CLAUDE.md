## Narrative Style

All passage.card text must be written with the narrative stance: First person, present tense, limited (Kira's POV)

POV character: /world/characters/Kira_Voss.card.card

Tone: Warm absurdist comedy with grounded stakes. Optimistic and curious even in crisis, finding genuine delight in bureaucratic weirdness rather than cynicism. Maintains tension from survival pressure while celebrating the earnest (if confused) attempts at cross-cultural communication. No mean-spirited humor—the aliens are trying their best, and so is Kira.

Reading level: Upper middle grade to young adult (ages 10-15)

Rating: PG

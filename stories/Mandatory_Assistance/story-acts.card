  <reasoning-acts>
    Based on narrative-guide themes and the 4-act structure, I need to show how the themes manifest across the story:

    Primary themes from narrative-guide:
    - Communication across different worldviews
    - What "help" means when filtered through incompatible frameworks
    - Whether earnest effort can bridge absurd misunderstanding

    Act 1 introduces all themes through the crisis: plants trying to help with HR protocols, communication barrier causing real problems, earnest effort making things worse.

    Act 2 explores the tension between effort and comprehension: they're learning during the wait, earnest effort IS helping despite absurdity, but Elder Heartwood's failure shows good intent without understanding fails.

    Act 3 forces resolution through crisis: real danger requires them to transcend the frameworks, authentic communication emerges under pressure.

    Act 4 answers the questions: Yes, earnest effort bridged the gap, but not through procedures—through genuine connection beyond frameworks. "Help" means showing up authentically, not following protocols. Communication works when you stop trying to translate and start being yourself.
  </reasoning-acts>
  <theme-intentions>
    - **Communication across different worldviews**: Introduced in Act 1 as the fundamental barrier—HR manuals as the only framework plants have for understanding humans creates absurd miscommunication. Explored in Act 2 through slow learning during waiting period (they ARE figuring each other out despite the barrier). Tested in Act 3 when crisis demands real communication beyond protocols. Resolved in Act 4 through authentic voices—Scout's non-verbal communication, Velvet finding words, plants differentiating from bureaucracy.

    - **What "help" means**: Act 1 establishes the mismatch—wellness checks while bleeding, forms instead of medicine, well-meaning harm. Act 2 complicates this through the quest (seeking authority to help properly) and the waiting period (accidentally helping through time together). Act 3 delivers real help through crisis—Sweetpea's sanctuary, cooperation during attack, genuine care without procedures. Act 4 shows help as presence, not protocol.

    - **Earnest effort vs. comprehension**: Act 1 asks the question through frustration—is trying hard enough when you don't understand? Act 2 suggests yes (learning despite themselves) then no (Elder Heartwood's category error shows effort without understanding fails). Act 3 reveals the answer—earnest effort builds the foundation for genuine understanding to emerge under pressure. Act 4 confirms: effort bridged the gap, but through connection, not procedures.

  <acts>
    **ACT 1: CONTACT &amp; BUREAUCRACY**
    - **Objective**: Survive the crash injuries and establish basic communication with the sentient plants who are trying to help
    - **Conflict**: The plants' only framework for understanding humans is HR manuals, creating a fundamental communication barrier that actively makes survival harder. Well-meaning help causes harm. Kira must navigate absurd bureaucracy while actually dying.
    - **Arc movement**: From terrified crash survivor to someone trying to work within (and around) an impossible system. From seeing the plants as obstacles to recognizing they're genuinely trying. Establishes Kira's pre-crisis character (enthusiastic, resourceful) before complications. Plants don't yet have individual voices—collective bureaucratic response.
    - **Theme manifestation**: Communication barrier introduced concretely: plants conduct wellness check while Kira bleeds, require forms for medical treatment, don't have concepts for urgency or pain outside HR protocols. "Help" shown as mismatch: Buddy's cheerful teaching moments during crisis, Runner's touching creating bruises, protocols that don't map to survival. Earnest effort making things worse: everyone trying hard, situation deteriorating.
    - **Estimated length**: 20,000-25,000 words (13-17 passages at 500-1500 words each)

    **ACT 2: QUEST &amp; LEARNING (DESPITE OURSELVES)**
    - **Objective**: Wait for Elder Heartwood's response (month-long delay) while managing ongoing survival challenges. Prove they can cooperate to earn the elder's help.
    - **Conflict**: Time pressure of survival vs. waiting. Building hope that authority will solve everything creates false expectations. The waiting period forces them together despite themselves. Challenge/test to prove cooperation reveals gaps. Florence's helpful lies create trust that will later hurt.
    - **Arc movement**: From hoping external authority has all the answers to discovering they're learning what matters through the waiting itself. Kira asserts herself more, plants begin differentiating (individual voices emerging). Elder Heartwood's response reveals fundamental category error—doesn't understand the question at all. Hope shatters but becomes freeing: they already learned what they needed.
    - **Theme manifestation**: Communication evolving: Scout develops non-verbal methods, Velvet starts forming words from moss, Runner's curiosity transforms to affection through touch. "Help" complicating: accidentally helping each other during waiting (sharing food sources, problem-solving together), plants trying to follow challenge requirements earnestly. Earnest effort both working (learning despite barrier) and failing (Elder Heartwood's complete misunderstanding shows limits of good intent without comprehension). Buddy learning when teaching moments aren't helpful.
    - **Estimated length**: 25,000-30,000 words (17-20 passages) - longest act, covers waiting period and relationship development

    **ACT 3: VACUUM &amp; THREAT**
    - **Objective**: Survive attack from hostile plants when authority structures have failed and they can only rely on each other
    - **Conflict**: Real physical danger—hostile plants attack. Florence's betrayal revealed (helpful lies about Elder Twist), complicating trust when they need it most. Protocols don't work for this crisis—must transcend frameworks.
    - **Arc movement**: From relying on procedures and authorities to authentic cooperation. Crisis forces plants' individual voices to emerge fully (not filtered through HR speak). Sweetpea becomes sanctuary during attack. Runner's touch-perception crucial for defense. Scout's non-verbal communication works under pressure. Victory through being themselves, not following protocols.
    - **Theme manifestation**: Communication transcending frameworks: under pressure, they understand each other beyond translation, Scout's non-verbal language works, Velvet's fragmented words convey meaning, authentic voices emerge. "Help" as genuine presence: Sweetpea's sanctuary isn't in the manual, Remedy's chemistry serves real need, cooperation without bureaucracy. Earnest effort's foundation pays off: all that fumbling learning created real connection that saves them.
    - **Estimated length**: 15,000-20,000 words (10-13 passages)

    **ACT 4: WHAT COMES NEXT**
    - **Objective**: Establish new dynamics for the 10 years ahead—found family, authentic relationships, protocols as tools not shields
    - **Conflict**: Unresolved challenges acknowledged (Buddy's "talk to trusted adult" loops, Remedy's boundary crisis, 10 years is a long time), but foundation is solid. Not wrapped up—ready.
    - **Arc movement**: From crisis mode to sustainable coexistence. Florence's redemption through own wisdom. Plants fully individuated with authentic voices. Kira changed by connection. Looking forward together with both excitement and uncertainty. They survived THIS, ready for what's next.
    - **Theme manifestation**: Communication as authentic voices: Scout comfortable in non-verbal identity, Velvet finding personhood through fragmented words, each plant speaking as themselves not as bureaucracy. "Help" redefined: presence not protocol, showing up authentically, Buddy trusting Kira instead of managing her. Earnest effort answered: yes, it bridged impossible gaps, but through connection not procedures—can't proceduralize genuine care.
    - **Estimated length**: 10,000-15,000 words (7-10 passages)

    **TOTAL ESTIMATED LENGTH**: 70,000-90,000 words (fits target novel length of 60-100k)

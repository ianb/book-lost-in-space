    In the aftermath, they process what happened and who they've become. Plants speak in authentic voices - Holloway uses procedures as tools not shields, Florence is valued for her own wisdom, Scout's non-verbal communication is fully respected, Velvet's personhood is recognized. They've built something real. A signal from outside - not rescue, but contact confirming they're not forgotten. The 10-year timeline is real, but so is their connection. They've survived THIS crisis; they'll face what comes next together.

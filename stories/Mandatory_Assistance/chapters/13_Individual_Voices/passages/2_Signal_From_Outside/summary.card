  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts emphasize durable state changes and information that will matter in later scenes: an actual human contact and rescue timeline (changes Kira’s options and plot momentum), the facility’s demonstrated ability to engineer functional long-range communications (changes what the plants can accomplish going forward), Kira’s emergent psychological state and an explicit decision window (affects her choices and relationships), and Scout’s emotional comprehension (affects interpersonal beats). I did not record transient scene details (who bounced where) or obvious actions already in the summary. No genuine contradictions with prior facts were found — this passage develops/updates earlier hints (Buddy detected signal; earlier rescue estimates) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately after the previous passage ended with Buddy announcing an unusual signal. Time cues: Buddy immediately begins analysis, the community mobilizes, Velvet grows an antenna, Remedy and Runner apply enhancements, Buddy transmits, a human freighter replies with an ETA of ~48 hours, and the protagonist spends time reflecting and talking with the group. Nothing indicates an overnight pause or large time jump. The whole sequence (analysis, rapid growth/assembly/coating, configuration, transmission, response, short celebration, and quiet reflection) plays out in one continuous block of action and reaction that remains in the same evening. Given typical pacing, this fits into a short window — on the order of tens of minutes to an hour — rather than multiple hours or days. The previous passage summary placed the earlier scene later afternoon / early evening (~18:30), and this passage clearly continues that moment. The passage ends after the freighter confirms a 48-hour ETA and the protagonist begins considering whether to stay; there is no further time jump. The gap from the previous passage is essentially none (immediate continuation), though a few minutes pass as the characters mobilize. Plausibility: Within the story's established setting, the timing is plausible. The plants have already been rapidly reworking the facility for weeks and have demonstrated coordinated, fast growth and technical improvisation, so growing an antenna and configuring amplification within minutes-to-hours is consistent with the narrative. The compression of complex tasks into a short span is a minor narrative condensation but not an internal contradiction. The 48-hour ETA for a freighter is realistic for a ship diverting to a rendezvous point from a commercial route. Overall, the temporal flow is coherent and believable within the story's internal rules.</reasoning>
    <starts>18:30</starts>
    <ends>19:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none / immediate continuation (a few minutes at most). The previous passage ended with Buddy detecting a signal; this one picks up that moment and covers the analysis, rapid community mobilization, antenna/amp construction, transmission, and response.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The scene compresses several technical tasks into a short period, but earlier text establishes rapid, coordinated plant growth and technical improvisation, so the quick turnaround (tens of minutes to an hour) is consistent with the story. The freighter's 48-hour ETA is also reasonable.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>All characters who speak or are mentioned in the passage are drawn from the previous-present list: Kira (narrator), Buddy (AI), Remedy, Runner, Velvet, Florence, Holloway, and Scout. No additional characters from the provided character list appear. The commercial freighter (Harmony Prospect) is heard over the signal but is not in the supplied character/entity lists, so it is not included as a character or entity path. No one new enters during this scene (everyone present at the start remains present), and no one present departs before the scene ends (the community disperses but no character exits the scene). The relevant location/entity is the planet/setting (Sector 7-Gamma-412), which is the only matching entity in the provided list.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage advances the rescue subplot and Kira’s central dilemma. Key new events: the plant community successfully constructs a plant-based communications system (Velvet antenna, Remedy conductivity, Runner amplification) using Buddy’s specs, transmits a distress signal, and receives a human reply from the freighter Harmony Prospect with an ETA of ~48 hours for extraction. It also develops Kira’s emotional arc: Buddy’s wellbeing analysis shows Kira is psychologically better integrated with the plants, she feels conflicted about leaving, and is given two days to decide—leaning toward staying. I consolidated earlier role-specific reconstruction details into a single bullet and kept only ongoing, plot-relevant facts (SAM offline, Buddy active, injuries, community governance changes) while removing some atmospheric specifics.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and stayed close to her.
      - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ coordination and a massive command node were neutralized; Runner and Remedy removed the node’s root system to prevent contamination.
      - Facility sustained heavy structural/resource damage; core life-support and medical systems remain functional; key plants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) are injured or depleted but regenerating/repairing.
      - Recovery prompted governance and social changes: Holloway publicly acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically without dominating decisions.
      - Reconstruction is committee-driven and species-aware; plants repurposed roles for rebuilding (underground resonance networks, structural growth, environmental enhancements, social curation).
      - Kira has been incorporated as a permanent community member; her human needs are shaping design decisions and planning for the western wing.
      - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal and the community prioritized establishing contact.
      - The community mobilized to build communications: Buddy provided technical specs; Velvet grew a directional antenna; Remedy applied conductive compounds; Runner configured underground resonance/amplification chambers (estimated ~×12 boost); Florence and Holloway coordinated integration; transmission sent.
      - A human commercial freighter, Harmony Prospect, acknowledged the signal, confirmed a survivor, requested coordinates and condition, and estimated extraction in ~48 hours; Buddy transmitted Kira’s status and coordinates.
      - The community celebrated, but Kira felt conflicted about leaving; Buddy’s comparative analysis shows her psychological well-being is higher now than before the crash.
      - Kira has 48 hours to decide whether to accept extraction or remain with the plant community; she is leaning toward staying, and the community (including Scout, Florence, Holloway, Runner, Velvet, Remedy) supports whatever choice she makes.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV feelings and why: Kira experiences a rapid emotional arc: stunned anticipation and technical hope at the moment of contact (this is the payoff they’ve been waiting for), immediately followed by a complicated hollow ambivalence when the impending rescue threatens the fragile belonging she’s built with the plant community. By the end of the passage she begins to move toward quiet clarity — accepting that belonging, not species or origin, determines "home." Reader experience: readers share the initial exhilaration and suspense of contact, then feel a poignant, bittersweet tug as Kira’s expected joy is undercut by emotional conflict; finally the reader feels a gentle uplift as Kira’s emerging acceptance reframes the decision as existential (where do I belong?). Multiple beats vs. dominant tone: there are multiple distinct beats — (1) exhilarated anticipation/hope, (2) conflicted hollow/sad belonging, (3) settling acceptance/hope — with the second (ambivalence about leaving) providing the emotional pivot that gives the passage its depth. Comparison to prior pattern: the passage continues the story’s recurring anticipation→tension→acceptance arc (contact = payoff) but subverts the expected pure relief by layering in belonging and moral choice. Rather than repeating earlier rescue beats, this one deepens the emotional stakes by making rescue an ambiguous good; the pattern is familiar but enriched and thus not merely repetitive.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Intense, acute anticipation and guarded hope while the community constructs the antenna and Buddy transmits — the long-desired human contact finally registers, and Kira feels all the tension of waiting and the possibility of rescue. Cause: the successful technical collaboration and Buddy’s confirmation of a human freighter with ETA forty-eight hours. Reader: shares suspense and a spike of relief/joy at the apparent success of the rescue attempt; the scene delivers the narrative payoff of the long buildup to contact.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, grief">POV: Immediate, complicated ambivalence — instead of unalloyed relief Kira feels hollow and conflicted as the reality of leaving the plant community sinks in. The plants’ visible delight and Scout’s sad-hopeful behavior make the potential departure feel like a real loss. Cause: the freighter’s ETA transforming the abstract desire for rescue into a concrete choice between two kinds of home. Reader: experiences a bittersweet tug — empathy for Kira’s loneliness and a soft pang for the community she would abandon; the emotion shifts the beat from celebration to poignant uncertainty.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Quiet, clarifying acceptance and cautious hope as Kira recognizes where her sense of belonging and psychological well-being have improved and begins to lean toward staying. She frames the decision as one about where her voice matters. Cause: Buddy’s well-being analysis, observing the community’s deliberate care, and time to reflect. Reader: feels gentle uplift and satisfaction as Kira moves from confusion to a clearer sense of identity and priorities — the passage resolves into a hopeful, bittersweet stance rather than frantic choice.</beat>
    </beats>
  </emotional-journey>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      This passage pivots on a clear plot beat (Buddy detects a human signal) that the community leverages by turning living architecture, chemistry, and coordination into a functioning uplink. Narrative payoffs in this scene are mostly about using previously-established assets (Runner’s network, Velvet’s growth, Remedy’s chemistry, Holloway/Florence coordination, Buddy’s sensors) to achieve contact — and then introducing an imminent choice for Kira (stay or leave).

      Fulfillments: several earlier setups are explicitly paid off when the plants and systems are repurposed to amplify and transmit a human emergency signal and secure a freighter response. Those fulfilled promises are ones that were listed as open in the previous passage and that the current passage resolves by demonstration.

      Lapses: one firm long-term expectation about rescue timing (the 12–18 month realistic timeline) is superseded by an immediate, concrete rescue window; it’s no longer a realistic anchor given the confirmed freighter ETA and so should be considered lapsed/superseded.

      Open/new promises: most of the earlier logistical, technical, and social threads remain unresolved and continue to matter (crash cause, navigation failure, SAM fate, resource limits, hostiles, broader political integration, toxic flora risk, etc.). New, immediate story-pressure promises are introduced around the freighter ETA and Kira’s impending decision — these are the dominant open beats going forward. There is also a newly-introduced but tentative promise that external contact may carry political/social consequences for the plant community (exposure, integration, risk), which will likely drive future scenes.

      Notes on classification choices: I only marked as fulfilled those items that the passage explicitly demonstrated (plant network used to contact humans; coordinated local cooperation to construct antenna and amplify the signal). The long-standing rescue-timeline estimate was contradicted by the freighter ETA and is therefore treated as lapsed/superseded. Many older/tentative threads are still plausibly relevant and so are carried forward rather than lapsed.

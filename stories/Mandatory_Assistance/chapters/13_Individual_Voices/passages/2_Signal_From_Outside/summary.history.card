      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage resolves the immediate ‘‘signal’’ cliffhanger from the previous scene: the community improvises a communications fix and establishes contact with a human freighter, which will arrive in ~48 hours. That action pays off two prior setups (the detected human signal and the tactical potential of Runner’s network). However, most strategic, social, logistical and emotional threads remain open — in particular Kira’s core decision about staying vs. leaving is now time-limited but unresolved. No earlier open promise is dropped or rendered moot; instead the discovery/response advances the plot and crystallizes new, time-sensitive stakes (the ETA and decision window).</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="POTENTIAL_HUMAN_SIGNAL_CONTACT">The previously detected artificial human signal is confirmed, contacted, and a human freighter (Harmony Prospect) acknowledges and will extract a survivor with an ETA of ~48 hours — the signal thread is activated and resolved to a concrete rescue timetable.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_NETWORK_ARTISTIC_TACTICAL_INTEGRATION">Runner's underground resonance/network is shown to have tactical utility (amplifying/translating radio transmission) as well as artistic use — it was actively repurposed to help contact the freighter.</promise>
        </fulfilled>

          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Communications were temporarily improvised and succeeded, but many other repairs (water, medical, structural) remain unfinished.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">Physical damage and depleted consumables persist; rebuilding scope and timeline are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner is creative and contributing but the long-term operational impact of their injuries (limits on risky missions) remains uncertain.</promise>

          <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner’s recovery is progressing but full recovery and limits on future operations are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_KIRA_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_ROUTINE">Holloway’s evacuation contingency exists; the arrival of a freighter in 48 hours tests external-extraction options but the routine’s broader adequacy remains unproven.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TARGET_SOUTHWEST_LIFE_SUPPORT">Southwest life-support vulnerabilities have not been engaged by these events and remain a live technical concern.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy’s shift toward quality-of-life production now intersects with tactical/communications work; downstream allocation trade-offs remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_AFTERMATH_AND_COUNTERADAPTATION">Whether hostile plants will adapt tactically after losing the command node remains unknown and dangerous.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_OFFENSIVE_TACTIC_POTENTIAL">Tactics that previously forced the command node to surface remain to be refined; now the community has improvised technical tactics as well.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_RECOVERY_AND_CAPACITY">Remedy is producing again but has not demonstrated full restoration of defensive/production capacity.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_CRITICAL_INJURY_RISK">Runner remains a critical asset whose availability for future high-risk missions is uncertain.</promise>

          <promise id="HUMAN_FRIENDLY_DESIGN_INTEGRATION">Human ergonomics are being integrated into the facility, but whether that permanence will persist and how it reshapes interspecies space use remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_PRESSURE_FROM_COMFORTS">Comfort-producing projects (scents, seating, art) consume resources and may create future trade-offs and political tensions.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_PERMANENT_INTEGRATION">Kira’s feeling of permanent belonging has been crystallized by the signal event but whether she will remain (and whether the community will continue to treat her as permanent) is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="DECISION_POINT_RESOLVE_SIGNAL_VS_COMMUNITY">The community’s decision about responding to the signal was engaged (they helped contact rescue), but the core choice — whether Kira leaves with the freighter or stays with the community — remains the central unresolved decision.</promise>
          <promise id="POTENTIAL_HUMAN_SIGNAL_CONTACT">(FULFILLED — carried here only as context) The signal was confirmed and a human freighter will extract the survivor in ~48 hours.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_NETWORK_ARTISTIC_TACTICAL_INTEGRATION">(FULFILLED — carried here only as context) Runner’s network has been used tactically to boost/relay the transmission.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_ETA_EXTRACTION">Newly crystallized promise: a human freighter (Harmony Prospect) will arrive to extract Kira in ~48 hours — this creates a concrete, time-limited choice.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_COMM_SIGNAL_BOOST">Newly introduced technical promise: Velvet/Remedy/Runner (with Buddy specs) can and will construct plant-based antennas, conductivity treatments, and resonance amplification to send/receive human radio communications.</promise>

          <promise id="KIRA_DECISION_TIME_LIMIT">Newly introduced narrative constraint: Kira has 48 hours before the freighter arrives to decide whether to leave or stay — the temporal pressure will force choice and consequences.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_CONSEQUENCES_OF_STAY_OR_LEAVE">Newly introduced interpersonal promise: Kira’s eventual choice will have concrete emotional and social consequences for the plant community (grief, political implications, resource/commitment changes) that remain to be explored.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_IMPACT_OF_SIGNAL_OPERATIONS">Newly introduced logistical promise: improvising the antenna/coat/amplification used tangible resources and may create new allocation pressures to be tracked.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selected facts emphasize durable state changes and information that will matter in later scenes: an actual human contact and rescue timeline (changes Kira’s options and plot momentum), the facility’s demonstrated ability to engineer functional long-range communications (changes what the plants can accomplish going forward), Kira’s emergent psychological state and an explicit decision window (affects her choices and relationships), and Scout’s emotional comprehension (affects interpersonal beats). I did not record transient scene details (who bounced where) or obvious actions already in the summary. No genuine contradictions with prior facts were found — this passage develops/updates earlier hints (Buddy detected signal; earlier rescue estimates) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_ESTABLISHED_BIOPHYSICAL_RADIO_TRANSMISSION_CAPABILITY">The plant collective (Velvet/Remedy/Runner with Buddy's specs) successfully designed, grew, and configured a plant-based directional antenna, applied conductivity-enhancing compounds, and used underground resonance structures to amplify and transmit standard human emergency radio frequencies.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_CONTACT_ESTABLISHED_WITH_HUMAN_FREIGHTER_HARMONY_PROSPECT">A human commercial freighter identifying itself as 'Harmony Prospect' acknowledged the facility's transmitted signal, requested identification, and agreed to extract the survivor.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RESCUE_ETA_48_HOURS">Harmony Prospect reported an estimated time of arrival of approximately forty-eight hours and requested landing coordinates to extract the survivor.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_MOBILIZED_FOR_SIGNAL_TRANSMISSION">The entire facility mobilized in an integrated effort (Buddy provided technical specs; Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Florence, Holloway coordinated and executed) to produce and broadcast the outgoing signal.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_FACING_RESIDENCY_DECISION_WITH_48_HOUR_WINDOW">Kira Voss now has a confirmed 48-hour decision window before the freighter arrives and is experiencing ambivalence—torn between accepting extraction and remaining with the plant community; she is leaning toward staying but has not decided.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_REPORTS_KIRA_WELLBEING_IMPROVED_COMPARED_TO_PRECRASH">Buddy's analysis reports Kira's current well-being indicators are significantly higher than her historical pre-crash baseline: increased belonging, purpose, social integration, and lower stress despite more challenging circumstances.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_RECOGNIZES_POTENTIAL_DEPARTURE_AND_EXHIBITS_SADNESS">Scout understands the practical consequence of successful contact (Kira may leave) and shows a complex emotional response (muted/ sad/pleading bounces) indicating comprehension of potential separation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_CAPABLE_OF_COORDINATING_LANDING_COORDINATES_WITH_HUMAN_VESSEL">The facility successfully transmitted landing/coordinate information to a human vessel and received operational acknowledgment — establishing that it can function as a pickup/extraction point for human ships.</fact>

      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately after the previous passage ended with Buddy announcing an unusual signal. Time cues: Buddy immediately begins analysis, the community mobilizes, Velvet grows an antenna, Remedy and Runner apply enhancements, Buddy transmits, a human freighter replies with an ETA of ~48 hours, and the protagonist spends time reflecting and talking with the group. Nothing indicates an overnight pause or large time jump. The whole sequence (analysis, rapid growth/assembly/coating, configuration, transmission, response, short celebration, and quiet reflection) plays out in one continuous block of action and reaction that remains in the same evening. Given typical pacing, this fits into a short window — on the order of tens of minutes to an hour — rather than multiple hours or days. The previous passage summary placed the earlier scene later afternoon / early evening (~18:30), and this passage clearly continues that moment. The passage ends after the freighter confirms a 48-hour ETA and the protagonist begins considering whether to stay; there is no further time jump. The gap from the previous passage is essentially none (immediate continuation), though a few minutes pass as the characters mobilize. Plausibility: Within the story's established setting, the timing is plausible. The plants have already been rapidly reworking the facility for weeks and have demonstrated coordinated, fast growth and technical improvisation, so growing an antenna and configuring amplification within minutes-to-hours is consistent with the narrative. The compression of complex tasks into a short span is a minor narrative condensation but not an internal contradiction. The 48-hour ETA for a freighter is realistic for a ship diverting to a rendezvous point from a commercial route. Overall, the temporal flow is coherent and believable within the story's internal rules.</reasoning>
        <starts>18:30</starts>
        <ends>19:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none / immediate continuation (a few minutes at most). The previous passage ended with Buddy detecting a signal; this one picks up that moment and covers the analysis, rapid community mobilization, antenna/amp construction, transmission, and response.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The scene compresses several technical tasks into a short period, but earlier text establishes rapid, coordinated plant growth and technical improvisation, so the quick turnaround (tens of minutes to an hour) is consistent with the story. The freighter's 48-hour ETA is also reasonable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>All characters who speak or are mentioned in the passage are drawn from the previous-present list: Kira (narrator), Buddy (AI), Remedy, Runner, Velvet, Florence, Holloway, and Scout. No additional characters from the provided character list appear. The commercial freighter (Harmony Prospect) is heard over the signal but is not in the supplied character/entity lists, so it is not included as a character or entity path. No one new enters during this scene (everyone present at the start remains present), and no one present departs before the scene ends (the community disperses but no character exits the scene). The relevant location/entity is the planet/setting (Sector 7-Gamma-412), which is the only matching entity in the provided list.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage advances the rescue subplot and Kira’s central dilemma. Key new events: the plant community successfully constructs a plant-based communications system (Velvet antenna, Remedy conductivity, Runner amplification) using Buddy’s specs, transmits a distress signal, and receives a human reply from the freighter Harmony Prospect with an ETA of ~48 hours for extraction. It also develops Kira’s emotional arc: Buddy’s wellbeing analysis shows Kira is psychologically better integrated with the plants, she feels conflicted about leaving, and is given two days to decide—leaning toward staying. I consolidated earlier role-specific reconstruction details into a single bullet and kept only ongoing, plot-relevant facts (SAM offline, Buddy active, injuries, community governance changes) while removing some atmospheric specifics.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and stayed close to her.
          - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ coordination and a massive command node were neutralized; Runner and Remedy removed the node’s root system to prevent contamination.
          - Facility sustained heavy structural/resource damage; core life-support and medical systems remain functional; key plants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) are injured or depleted but regenerating/repairing.
          - Recovery prompted governance and social changes: Holloway publicly acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically without dominating decisions.
          - Reconstruction is committee-driven and species-aware; plants repurposed roles for rebuilding (underground resonance networks, structural growth, environmental enhancements, social curation).
          - Kira has been incorporated as a permanent community member; her human needs are shaping design decisions and planning for the western wing.
          - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal and the community prioritized establishing contact.
          - The community mobilized to build communications: Buddy provided technical specs; Velvet grew a directional antenna; Remedy applied conductive compounds; Runner configured underground resonance/amplification chambers (estimated ~×12 boost); Florence and Holloway coordinated integration; transmission sent.
          - A human commercial freighter, Harmony Prospect, acknowledged the signal, confirmed a survivor, requested coordinates and condition, and estimated extraction in ~48 hours; Buddy transmitted Kira’s status and coordinates.
          - The community celebrated, but Kira felt conflicted about leaving; Buddy’s comparative analysis shows her psychological well-being is higher now than before the crash.
          - Kira has 48 hours to decide whether to accept extraction or remain with the plant community; she is leaning toward staying, and the community (including Scout, Florence, Holloway, Runner, Velvet, Remedy) supports whatever choice she makes.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV feelings and why: Kira experiences a rapid emotional arc: stunned anticipation and technical hope at the moment of contact (this is the payoff they’ve been waiting for), immediately followed by a complicated hollow ambivalence when the impending rescue threatens the fragile belonging she’s built with the plant community. By the end of the passage she begins to move toward quiet clarity — accepting that belonging, not species or origin, determines "home." Reader experience: readers share the initial exhilaration and suspense of contact, then feel a poignant, bittersweet tug as Kira’s expected joy is undercut by emotional conflict; finally the reader feels a gentle uplift as Kira’s emerging acceptance reframes the decision as existential (where do I belong?). Multiple beats vs. dominant tone: there are multiple distinct beats — (1) exhilarated anticipation/hope, (2) conflicted hollow/sad belonging, (3) settling acceptance/hope — with the second (ambivalence about leaving) providing the emotional pivot that gives the passage its depth. Comparison to prior pattern: the passage continues the story’s recurring anticipation→tension→acceptance arc (contact = payoff) but subverts the expected pure relief by layering in belonging and moral choice. Rather than repeating earlier rescue beats, this one deepens the emotional stakes by making rescue an ambiguous good; the pattern is familiar but enriched and thus not merely repetitive.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Intense, acute anticipation and guarded hope while the community constructs the antenna and Buddy transmits — the long-desired human contact finally registers, and Kira feels all the tension of waiting and the possibility of rescue. Cause: the successful technical collaboration and Buddy’s confirmation of a human freighter with ETA forty-eight hours. Reader: shares suspense and a spike of relief/joy at the apparent success of the rescue attempt; the scene delivers the narrative payoff of the long buildup to contact.</beat>
          <beat tags="belonging, grief">POV: Immediate, complicated ambivalence — instead of unalloyed relief Kira feels hollow and conflicted as the reality of leaving the plant community sinks in. The plants’ visible delight and Scout’s sad-hopeful behavior make the potential departure feel like a real loss. Cause: the freighter’s ETA transforming the abstract desire for rescue into a concrete choice between two kinds of home. Reader: experiences a bittersweet tug — empathy for Kira’s loneliness and a soft pang for the community she would abandon; the emotion shifts the beat from celebration to poignant uncertainty.</beat>
          <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Quiet, clarifying acceptance and cautious hope as Kira recognizes where her sense of belonging and psychological well-being have improved and begins to lean toward staying. She frames the decision as one about where her voice matters. Cause: Buddy’s well-being analysis, observing the community’s deliberate care, and time to reflect. Reader: feels gentle uplift and satisfaction as Kira moves from confusion to a clearer sense of identity and priorities — the passage resolves into a hopeful, bittersweet stance rather than frantic choice.</beat>

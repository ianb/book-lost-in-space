      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage turns the previously teased radio signal into an active plot driver: Buddy's detection is validated, the community improvises a working antenna/resonance system, and an actual human freighter acknowledges the distress call with a 48-hour ETA. That sequence pays off specific prior setups (Buddy's tactical/informational role; the ambiguous human signal). It also converts the earlier social-development material into stakes: Kira now faces a concrete choice (leave with humans or remain with the plant community). Most of the earlier open promises remain relevant and are reinforced (community inclusion, cultural renovation, ongoing repairs, resource and defense concerns, Florence's conditional vulnerability, Scout as emotional bridge, etc.). A few narrative beats are introduced that set up future expectations: a hard extraction window/decision point, explicit community support for Kira's choice, and possible consequences of renewed human contact for the plant community. I have only marked as fulfilled the prior open promises that were explicitly resolved in this passage; nothing important is explicitly contradicted, so I did not mark longstanding defensive/ resource/ trust concerns as lapsed.</reasoning>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage advances several durable plot points that will affect later scenes: the facility successfully establishes two‑way contact with a human vessel (Harmony Prospect) and arranges an extraction with an ETA of ~48 hours; the plant community demonstrated functional capability to improvise radio/communications hardware (Velvet, Remedy, Runner cooperating) and can coordinate complex technical work; Buddy acted as the communications/liaison node and transmitted Kira's ID and coordinates; Kira now faces an imminent, time‑limited choice about whether to return to human society or remain with the plant community — a psychological/plot hinge. Also significant: Buddy's analytics report that Kira's psychological well‑being is measurably improved compared to her pre‑crash baseline, and Scout is emotionally attached and understands the stakes (which will influence character choices and group dynamics). These are long‑term facts because they change rescue timelines, establish the community's technical/coordination capacities, alter Kira's personal arc (choice about belonging), and create an upcoming deadline (48 hours) that will drive decisions and tension. The only genuine contradiction with prior material is that an earlier established fact records Kira as having already expressed a decision to stay; here she is undecided (though leaning toward staying), so the two statements cannot both be true as absolute in the same continuity moment.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SIGNAL_CONFIRMED_HUMAN_EMERGENCY_FREQUENCIES">Buddy analyzed the detected signal and confirmed it is an artificial transmission broadcasting standard human emergency frequencies.</fact>

In this passage Kira has been offered extraction but is explicitly undecided (though leaning toward staying); she says she needs time to think and has forty‑eight hours to decide. These two statements conflict if both are presented as current, definitive positions.</conflict>
        </conflicts>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>This passage continues directly from the previous scene (the human signal detection). Temporal cues: it opens with Buddy immediately analyzing the signal and the community beginning work on an antenna/amplification setup; a transmission is sent and a human freighter replies with ETA “approximately forty‑eight hours.” The characters then celebrate briefly and have an extended, reflective conversation about the upcoming choice. There is no depiction of the freighter arriving; instead the scene ends with the protagonist recognizing they have two days to decide. Therefore the passage covers the immediate response, construction/activation of communications, the contact exchange, and several minutes-to-hours of social/psychological processing. I treat the previous passage end time (authoritative) 2687-05-14T12:00 as the exact moment the signal was detected and this passage begins immediately after it. The whole sequence — rapid plant growth of an antenna, chemical coating, underground resonance tuning, one broadcast and one reply, plus celebration/conversation — plausibly fits into a short period (on the order of 1–3 hours) given the story’s established accelerated plant capabilities and existing partially intact infrastructure. Note: the previous-passage summary described the detection as “evening,” which conflicts with the authoritative timestamp (12:00); I used the authoritative timestamp as instructed.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-05-14T12:00</starts>
        <ends>2687-05-14T13:30</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — this passage continues immediately from the previous one (0 minutes). The signal detection at the end of the prior passage prompts the instant actions shown here.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The actions (analyzing the signal, plants rapidly growing an antenna, Remedy producing conductivity compounds, Runner configuring resonance amplification, Buddy broadcasting ID, and receiving a reply with ETA) are all consistent with the world already established in the prior passage: rapid, purposeful plant growth; an existing underground/resonance network; an AI (Buddy) capable of immediate analysis and transmission; and a partly functional facility to integrate components. The short elapsed time (roughly 1–3 hours) is reasonable in this context. One minor caveat: the apparent near‑instantaneous human reply presumes the freighter is within communication latency (in‑system or reachable by relay); if the freighter were light‑hours away, reply would have notable delay. The text implies an available, timely channel, so that assumption is necessary but consistent with the scene. Overall there are no major timing contradictions within the passage or with the authoritative previous end time (aside from the summary’s “evening” wording, which conflicts with the provided 12:00 timestamp).</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>The passage features the narrator Kira plus the AI Buddy and the community members who work together: Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Florence, Holloway, and Scout. All of these characters are mentioned by name and participate in the scene. No new characters arrive during the passage (everyone listed was already present at the start), and no named character leaves before the passage ends (the community disperses to give Kira space, but no one exits the scene). The passage references the show 'Uncharted' (Maverick Stone), so the corresponding entity is included. No mention is made of Sector_7-Gamma-412 in this passage.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage resolves the earlier signal tension and adds a decisive new plot development plus an important character conflict. I replaced the earlier tentative signal detection note with a concrete outcome: Buddy confirms the signal is human, and the community rapidly engineers a plant-based communications system (directional antenna, chemical conductivity coating, underground amplification) that lets Buddy contact a commercial freighter, Harmony Prospect, which will extract one survivor (Kira) in ~48 hours. The passage also establishes the community's coordinated technical roles (Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Florence, Holloway, Scout), shows Kira's emotional conflict about leaving versus belonging, and Buddy's analysis that Kira's wellbeing is higher in the plant community than pre-crash. I consolidated multiple earlier environment/design bullets into fewer items that remain plot-relevant (ongoing rebuilding, Runner's network repurposing, Velvet/Remedy/Holloway roles) and removed or downplayed purely atmospheric details. The new summary keeps events chronological and focused on facts that will matter going forward: the imminent rescue, who it concerns, how contact was achieved, and Kira's decision dilemma with a 48-hour deadline.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Mining shuttle crashed during approach; Kira Voss survived with AI Buddy and Scout active; SAM remains offline.
          - Hull breach revealed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; local plant collective sheltered survivors and used the shuttle as shelter.
          - Hostile plants coordinated assaults from an underground root command node; defenders improvised layered defenses, chemical traps, and located the node ~50 m east.
          - Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway and others forced the command node to surface; defenders destroyed and extracted the root mass, collapsing hostile coordination.
          - Victory incurred heavy damage and supply depletion; survivors were injured/exhausted but survived; Florence began reintegration from isolation.
          - Over subsequent weeks the group shifted from survival to cooperative recovery: Florence reintegrated; Buddy and Scout observed voluntary cooperation.
          - Facility reconstruction moved from restoring old protocols to co-designed shared spaces; plants and humans redesigned spaces for joint life.
          - Runner repurposed the underground network for transit, communication and acoustic/resonance chambers used functionally and as early-warning systems.
          - Velvet regrew structural elements into purpose-built living spaces informed by human feedback; Remedy expanded craft chemistry into environmental comfort and enhancements.
          - Holloway coordinates non-authoritatively; Florence contributes defensive/safety integration; Scout curates social artifacts and provides emotional support.
          - Buddy detected an artificial signal on the array; the community prioritized investigating possible human contact.
          - Buddy confirmed the signal was on human emergency frequencies; the community mobilized to build a plant-based communications uplink (Velvet grew a directional antenna, Remedy applied conductivity compounds, Runner configured underground amplification chambers; Florence and Holloway coordinated integration; Scout provided emotional support).
          - Buddy contacted a human vessel: commercial freighter Harmony Prospect acknowledged the signal, confirmed one survivor, and estimated extraction in ~48 hours after receiving coordinates.
          - Kira instructed Buddy to report she is medically stable and being cared for; the freighter accepted coordinates and began extraction planning.
          - The community celebrated success, but Kira experienced conflicted emotions about leaving a community that has given her belonging; Holloway and others offered support and time to decide.
          - Buddy's analysis shows Kira's psychological well-being and sense of belonging are significantly improved compared to pre-crash baselines.
          - Kira has a 48-hour deadline to decide whether to accept extraction or remain; she is leaning toward staying but has not finalized her decision.

      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          This passage pivots the scene from tactical suspense into an intimate identity conflict. POV (Kira) experiences three emotional currents: pragmatic exhilaration and hope as the community improvises a way to transmit and contact humans; a tightening suspense while the team waits and then the quick, factual relief of a freighter reply; and—most importantly—a complex, bittersweet ambivalence when she realizes rescue doesn't feel triumphant. The reader rides that arc: uplift at the group's competence, high suspense during the wait, then an emotional subversion when expected joy is replaced by hollow uncertainty and the quiet warmth of belonging.

          Compared to the story so far, this continues the established pattern of practical cooperation and the plants’ surprising technical fluency, but it reverses an earlier emotional expectation (rescue = catharsis). Instead of a single triumphant beat, the passage delivers a layered emotional resolution: one moment of collective efficacy (consistent with prior cooperative growth), then a personal reckon-ing that crystallizes Kira’s internal identity shift (the story’s long emotional through-line). The main surprises are emotional (Kira’s mixed reaction) rather than plot mechanics. Character development centers on Kira (decision/identity) and on the collective’s relational stance (explicit offer of help and the invitation to stay), with Buddy also stepping into a clearer emotional-analyst/support role.

          Reader experience: moved from technical awe and suspense into a quiet, morally complex intimacy—an earned, tender ambivalence that reframes the entire rescue trope. The passage honors prior beats (trust-built, cooperation) while delivering a satisfying identity-turn: Kira must choose between biological kinship and the relational community that has made her voice matter.
        </reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="hope, determination">Collective mobilization and technical improvisation. POV: Kira feels hopeful and quietly awed as the plants and allies mobilize—Velvet grows an antenna, Remedy supplies conductors, Runner tunes resonance. This produces pragmatic excitement and relief that contact may be possible. Reader: uplifted and impressed by the group's ingenuity and cooperative competence.</beat>
          <beat tags="suspense, unease">The tense wait and human response. POV: Seconds stretch unbearably; Kira expects catharsis. When the freighter replies with a 48-hour ETA, the objective relief arrives but with an uneasy time-pressure. Reader: experiences sharp suspense that resolves into a hesitant relief mixed with the foreboding that a consequential choice is imminent.</beat>
          <beat tags="intimacy, acceptance">Kira's emotional reversal and crystallizing identity choice. POV: rather than triumphant joy, she feels hollow, confused, and unexpectedly attached to the plant community; she recognizes genuine belonging and begins to lean toward staying. The plant collective offers support and time to decide, creating a warm, intimate atmosphere. Reader: moved by the tender moral complexity and the reframing of 'rescue' as an emotional dilemma rather than a simple happy ending.</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="character, reversal">Kira's emotional reaction to confirmed rescue is unexpectedly ambivalent rather than jubilant. Given the long arc of wanting rescue, the reader expects triumphant relief; instead the scene subverts that expectation—rescue becomes the catalyst for a deeper identity question (stay vs. return). This is an emotional reversal that surprises by privileging belonging over the anticipated plot payoff.</surprise>
        </surprises>
        <character-development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="identity-shift">Faces a concrete choice and experiences an identity-shift: rescue is available, but she realizes she now feels strong belonging and agency in the plant community. She begins moving from a stranded survivor seeking retrieval to someone who may choose to remain where her voice matters. This is both a decision-forming moment and an identity crystallization.</development>

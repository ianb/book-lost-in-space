      <message>Updated voice - 10 years confirmed but Kira says 'We've got this'</message>
    </changelog-entry>
    <outline version="2.0.0">
      <story-goal>
        Signal from outside confirms: 10 years, but you're not forgotten. Kira's reaction surprises her: "Okay. We've got this." She's not devastated by the timeline. She's not waiting to be rescued anymore. This IS her life. And it's GOOD.

      <pov-inner-life>
        Kira hearing the timeline confirmed. 10 years. Should be devastating. But... "Okay. We've got this." When did she stop waiting for rescue? When did she stop treating this as temporary? The journey WAS the answer. These friends ARE the answer. She's HOME.

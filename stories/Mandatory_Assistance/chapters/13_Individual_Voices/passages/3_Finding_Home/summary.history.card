      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I read the passage with the previous open-promises list in mind and asked: which outstanding setups were explicitly resolved here, which were rendered moot, and what new narrative threads were introduced by Kira's conversations and final choice? The passage is essentially a resolution scene: Kira spends the allotted time deliberating, repeatedly tested by interlocutors (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Florence, Holloway, Scout), and then makes a committed choice to stay and to tell the freighter in person. That resolves the central time-limited dilemma introduced earlier but leaves almost all structural, logistical, and strategic problems intact. I therefore treated internal, social, and decision-state promises (the 48-hour decision, Kira's integration/permanence, and the central decision-versus-signal conflict) as fulfilled. Promises tied to external systems, resources, long-term governance, hostile forces, contamination, infrastructure, and capacity remain open. A small set of previous promises that were specifically about facilitating Kira's extraction are now moot or overtaken by Kira's choice (I mark COMMUNITY_SUPPORTS_EVACUATION as lapsed/made-moot because the community’s extraction support will not be used as planned). The passage also creates concrete new threads: Kira's formal commitment to stay (and to announce that to the arriving freighter), an explicit community offer of membership (formalizing her integration), Scout's attachment becoming a narratively consequential emotional stake, and the implicit possibility of a human/bureaucratic response when Kira declines extraction. These new threads introduce future scenes and tensions (telling the freighter, human reaction, formal membership work, resource consequences of an added permanent human), and they should be tracked going forward.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="DECISION_POINT_RESOLVE_SIGNAL_VS_COMMUNITY">The central unresolved choice — whether Kira would leave with the arriving human freighter or remain with the plant community — was decided: Kira chooses to stay. The narrative tension central to the previous passage is paid off.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_DECISION_TIME_LIMIT">The 48-hour time constraint intended to force a decision has been used as intended: Kira makes her decision within the allotted window.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_PERMANENT_INTEGRATION">Kira moves from ambiguous residency to an affirmed intention to remain. The community repeatedly affirms she is not a guest but a member, and Kira commits to staying — resolving the question of whether she will remain integrated.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <lapsed>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_SUPPORTS_EVACUATION">The plant community's active facilitation of contact/extraction (the social promise to support evacuation) is now moot as a future obligation because Kira declines extraction and intends to remain. (Note: the community did perform those actions already, but their continuing obligation to extract is no longer relevant.)</promise>
        </lapsed>
        <open>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">Durable reconciliation and governance consequences (factional handling, institutionalized trust structures) remain untested by future stressors; trust-building still needs to be institutionalized and stress‑tested.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">The deeper motivations and strategic adaptation of hostile plant forces remain unexplained and dangerous; nothing in this passage addresses enemy intent or adaptation.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">High morale is evident, but resource limits and infrastructure fragility remain; the community remains vulnerable to long-term weakening.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Formal negotiation of territorial rituals, physical and social boundary markers remains unresolved as community space solidifies.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">Enemy territorial marking and implications for escalation/negotiation remain unaddressed.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Political consequences and potential factionalism in plant governance (post-action legitimacy) are unresolved; the community's new practices may produce future contestation.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">Who will reliably sustain day-to-day medical and caregiving routines under resource strain remains unsettled.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy continues to be emotionally invested and expanding roles, but long-term willingness and burnout risk are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal protocols for boundary control and handoff still need negotiation as social geography becomes fixed.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's operational and emotional dependence on plant allies remains a structural vulnerability for future choices and missions.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Durable shelter, supplies, sustainable systems and reliable external support continue to be necessary but unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Critical shortages and resource flows remain a pressing practical problem.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Questions about elder communications and possible deception have not been revisited and remain live.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">Whether the emergent collaborative practices will be codified, contested, or institutionalized remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Many repairs and technical/logistical tasks (water, medical, structural) remain unfinished and must be coordinated.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">Physical damage and depleted consumables persist; scope/timeline for rebuilding remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner remains an irreplaceable asset with injuries that may limit future risky operations; long-term operational impact remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="CHEMICAL_NEUTRALIZATION_SECONDARY_HAZARD">Potential toxic residues and long-term environmental/health hazards from previous neutralization are still unaddressed.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_DEPLETION_CRISIS">Remedy has restarted production but the longer-term consequences of prior depletion and time to full recovery remain unclear.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_SUSTAINABILITY_FAILURE">Velvet's active growth and design work are impressive but longer-term sustainability under continued strain remains a question.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner's recovery is improving but full restoration and limits on future operations are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_KIRA_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_ROUTINE">Holloway's evacuation contingency exists; its broader adequacy (for other scenarios, or if Kira changes her mind) is still unproven.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TARGET_SOUTHWEST_LIFE_SUPPORT">Southwest life-support vulnerabilities remain a live technical concern.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy's shift toward QoL and tactical support creates downstream allocation trade-offs that remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_AFTERMATH_AND_COUNTERADAPTATION">Whether hostile plants will adapt tactically after losing the command node is still unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_OFFENSIVE_TACTIC_POTENTIAL">Previously-productive tactics need refinement; improvised technical tactics were used but require further development.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_RECOVERY_AND_CAPACITY">Remedy is producing again but has not demonstrated full restoration of defensive/production capacity.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_CRITICAL_INJURY_RISK">Runner remains a critical asset with uncertain availability for future high-risk missions.</promise>
          <promise id="AFTERMATH_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_REPAIR">Rebuilding tasks remain incomplete and will need ongoing coordination and materials.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_DISPOSAL_AND_CONTAMINATION_CLEANUP">Long-term disposal and environmental cleanup of the command node remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_ROLE_EXPANSION">Remedy's broadened role into QoL and tactical support continues to create social and resource consequences to be worked out.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_FRIENDLY_DESIGN_INTEGRATION">Human ergonomics are being integrated into the facility, but permanence and interspecies space-use consequences remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_PRESSURE_FROM_COMFORTS">Comfort-producing projects consume resources and may create future trade-offs and political tensions.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_ETA_EXTRACTION">The human freighter (Harmony Prospect) is still due to arrive tomorrow; the concrete sequence of interaction (Kira's report to them, whether the freighter departs, etc.) is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_CONSEQUENCES_OF_STAY_OR_LEAVE">Immediate emotional reactions occurred, but longer-term interpersonal, political, and resource implications of Kira's choice are still to be explored.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_IMPACT_OF_SIGNAL_OPERATIONS">Improvised antenna/amplification consumed materials; downstream resource allocation consequences remain to be tracked.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's dependence on plant allies (emotional/operational) remains a longer-term structural vulnerability (left in open list to emphasize ongoing risk).</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">Even though Kira is accepted socially, whether formal protocols or rules will be codified (e.g., rights/duties of a human member) remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="AFTER-EVENTS_POLITICAL_FALLOUT">How the community will handle longer-term political fallout from Kira's decision (and from having aided human contact) remains open; this is connected to many governance promises above.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage resolves Kira's residency decision and records the social consequences of that choice — the single most significant long-term fact for the story going forward. It also documents her plan to inform the arriving freighter in person, and Scout's strong emotional reaction. Other beats (Runner/Velvet/Remedy/Holloway/Florence thanking Kira and describing how she changed them) reinforce pre-existing character arcs and community bonds but largely echo established developments; I record only the consolidated, long-term state changes that would matter in later chapters. I found no contradictions with the previously established facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_COMMITS_TO_STAY">Kira Voss decides to remain living with the plant community — she chooses to stay rather than accept extraction by the arriving freighter.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_WILL_TELL_FREIGHTER_TOMORROW">Kira plans to inform the Harmony Prospect (the arriving freighter) in person when it arrives the next day that she is choosing to stay.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_REACTION_TO_DECISION_HAPPY">Scout reacts with intense joy and relief to Kira's decision and affirms continued close companionship (emotional state: elated, relieved, attachment strengthened).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_MEMBERS_EXPLICITLY_ACKNOWLEDGE_KIRA_IMPACT">Multiple core community members (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence) personally acknowledge that Kira changed them/us — crediting her with concrete shifts (confidence, aesthetic/ergonomic design, chemistry for comfort, social inclusion/reintegration) and stating they will miss her if she leaves; the group expresses valuing her as an actual member rather than a temporary guest.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Time cues in the passage: the narrator opens with "I spend the next two days talking to everyone." In the previous passage the freighter ETA was given as "approximately forty‑eight hours" at 19:00. The current passage therefore begins immediately after that announcement and covers roughly the two‑day interval before the freighter arrives. The passage traces conversations across that span (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout) and ends the evening before the freighter's arrival, when the narrator decides to stay and plans to tell the crew the next day. There is a small internal slip: the narrator momentarily thinks "third day—wait, no. The second day," and later says "The freighter arrives tomorrow," which slightly conflicts with the earlier explicit "forty‑eight hours" ETA if you read "next two days" as consuming the full 48 hours. Overall the intended timeline is: start immediately after the previous passage (19:00), spend about two days in conversations, and finish the night before the scheduled pickup. The gap from the previous passage is effectively none (this is the continuous two‑day interval following it). The timing is plausible — two days is a reasonable amount of time for repeated, in‑depth interpersonal conversations and for the narrator to reach a major personal decision. The only issue is the minor inconsistency around "second/third day" and "tomorrow" versus the stated 48‑hour ETA; it's a small narrative slip but does not create an implausible sequence of events.</reasoning>
        <starts>19:00 (immediately after the previous passage)</starts>
        <ends>Approximately 48 hours later — the evening/night before the freighter's arrival (i.e., the night before the scheduled pickup; narrator plans to tell them the next day)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — this passage continues directly from the previous scene; it covers the two days following the previous passage's 19:00 time. During that interval the narrator talks with each community member, reflects, and arrives at a decision.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Spending two days in repeated conversations, reflection, and arriving at a firm decision about whether to stay or be rescued is realistic. The physical actions and interactions described fit the time given. Note the minor internal inconsistency (the narrator's flit between "third day" and "second day" and the phrasing "tomorrow the freighter arrives" vs. the earlier explicit 48‑hour ETA), but it does not materially undermine the sequence — it reads as a momentary confusion rather than a serious logical error.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present in the passage: Kira (narrator) appears throughout. Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout, and Buddy all appear and speak or are described interacting with Kira. No other named characters from the available list are referenced. The passage references the arriving freighter and the plant community/facility, but the only available entity in the provided list that is relevant is the Sector 7-Gamma-412 Planet. "Entered" should list characters who arrive during this passage but were not present at the start; according to the provided previous-present list, all characters who appear here were already present at the end of the previous passage, so none newly enter. No character is described as leaving before the passage ends, so there are no exits to record.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage describes Kira spending two days talking with the plant community before the freighter arrives, during which each plant (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence) explains how Kira changed their perspectives and affirms her membership. Scout reiterates attachment. Buddy reconfirms that Kira's well‑being is measurably higher in the plant community. Kira decides to stay and will inform the arriving freighter in person. I consolidated repetitive or atmospheric details from the previous summary (e.g., individual technical minutiae and decorative descriptions) and merged related governance/reconstruction points to keep the running summary focused on events that affect future choices and relationships.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural‑link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and stayed close to her.
          - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ coordination and a massive command node were neutralized; Runner and Remedy removed the node’s root system to prevent contamination.
          - Facility sustained heavy structural/resource damage; core life‑support and medical systems remain functional; key plants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) are injured or regenerating.
          - Governance changed after recovery: Holloway publicly acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically without dominating decisions.
          - Reconstruction is committee‑driven and species‑aware; plants repurposed roles for rebuilding (underground resonance/amplification, structural growth, environmental/chemical enhancements, social curation).
          - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal; the community built a directional antenna and integrated conductive/resonant systems (Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Florence, Holloway coordinated) and transmitted coordinates and Kira’s status.
          - Human commercial freighter Harmony Prospect acknowledged the signal, confirmed a survivor, and estimated extraction in ~48 hours (freighter now due to arrive imminently).
          - Kira felt conflicted about leaving; Buddy’s analysis showed her psychological well‑being and sense of purpose are significantly higher in the plant community than in human civilization.
          - Over two days Kira spoke individually with Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway and Florence; each credited her with changing their approaches (tactical voice, aesthetics, comfort/chemistry, inclusive leadership, chance at redemption) and affirmed she is a valued community member while supporting whatever she chooses.
          - Scout expressed unconditional attachment and preferred Kira stay; after reflecting on belonging versus familiarity, Kira decided to remain with the plant community and will tell the arriving freighter in person tomorrow.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV: Kira moves from reflective uncertainty to clarified belonging and quiet resolve. The passage stages a series of intimate, validating conversations (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout, Buddy) that show how her presence changed the community and, in turn, how deeply the community has become part of her identity. This external affirmation forces the internal question—"What do I actually want?"—and resolves with a calm, deliberate decision to stay. Reader: feels warm, satisfied, and emotionally uplifted; there’s also a gentle bittersweetness because the choice sacrifices an expected return to human civilization. There are multiple beats: (1) communal affirmation and mutual transformation, (2) inward deliberation about values/loyalty, (3) decisive acceptance and peaceful relief. These reuse the story’s long-running motifs (belonging, acceptance, hope) but function as a culmination rather than repetitive padding—the arc feels like payoff and emotional resolution for long-built themes rather than redundant repetition.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="belonging, hope">Affirmation and recognition from the community. Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, and Florence each tell Kira how her questions and voice changed them and the facility, producing a warm sense that she truly matters here. POV experiences moved validation and belonging; reader experiences tenderness, satisfaction, and uplift as the found-family motif is reinforced and the plants are humanized as reciprocal companions.</beat>
          <beat tags="anticipation, acceptance">Quiet, internal deliberation about what she actually wants. Kira weighs human familiarity, resources, and species loyalty against the depth of connection and meaningful contribution she found with the plants. POV feels tense curiosity shifting toward pragmatic acceptance as she tests her motives; reader feels engaged anticipation and ethical sympathy—watching the protagonist choose values over default obligations.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, belonging">Decisive emotional resolution: Kira chooses to stay. The final acceptance is calm and relieved—she claims membership rather than temporary refuge, and experiences a warm, settled sense of home. Reader feels cathartic relief, joy, and emotional closure: the long arc of mistrust and isolation resolves into durable belonging and hope for the group's future.</beat>

      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>Objective physical facts at the end of the passage: Kira has spent two days in the plant facility talking with community members; the human freighter (commercial freighter Harmony Prospect) remains in contact and is scheduled to arrive the next day to extract the transmitted survivor coordinates. The plant-built directional antenna on the facility roof is at optimal height and coated with Remedy’s conductivity compounds; Runner’s underground resonance chambers and linked amplification network are configured and actively producing subtle harmonics. Remedy’s chemical enhancements are active in the air (pleasant scents/environmental modifiers). Velvet’s growth structures (seating, translucent new light-filtering panels, and other architectural elements) are installed and providing human-oriented comfort; Holloway’s bioluminescent lighting is on. Kira is physically in her enhanced sleeping area (original sleeping space augmented with Velvet’s moss and Remedy’s scents and acoustic tuning) with Scout curled up beside her. Buddy (the AI) is online and available. Other core occupants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence) are present in the facility but have been giving Kira space while remaining nearby and available. The facility’s original communications hardware remains damaged but functionally supplemented by the plant-grown antenna/amplification system. At least part of the facility (previously noted western wing) remains unrenovated. It is evening/night (bioluminescence, Kira sleeps), interior conditions are comfortable and low-intensity activity continues (humming resonance, soft lighting). The freighter expects to extract one survivor at the provided coordinates tomorrow; Kira intends to inform them in person of her choice to stay, but the only immediate physical certainty is the freighter’s scheduled arrival and the facility’s readiness to communicate/receive it.</reasoning>

        <reasoning>
          Summary of what this passage did to the story's setups and foreshadowing:

          What was paid off: The passage resolves Kira's short-term internal decision: after talking with the community she chooses to remain. That resolves the explicit decision-point promises from the previous passage and demonstrates social support and Scout's companion role in practice. The passage also concretely stages the immediate next beat — the freighter arrives tomorrow and Kira plans to tell them in person — creating a new, imminent confrontation promise.

          What remains unresolved: Most strategic, institutional, and logistical threads introduced earlier (hostile threats, formal governance, resources, formal consequences for Florence, SAM's status, long-term survival planning, the freighter's institutional reaction and territorial/legal consequences, repair timelines, command-node exploitation, etc.) are not resolved here and are carried forward. Many of those are specifically about formalization, institutional consequences, and systemic vulnerabilities; the passage deepens the human-scale social consequences (identity, belonging) but leaves systemic questions open.

          What was newly introduced: The passage creates a set of concrete follow-on promises now that Kira has decided to stay — notably that she will formally refuse extraction in person, that the freighter's reaction and public/bureaucratic consequences are now a near-term plot point, and that Kira's choice will pressure community governance to formalize membership/rights and catalyze cultural change. It also deepens character arcs (Kira's identity pivot, Florence's social-rehab arc, Scout's long-term emotional role) that will have narrative consequences.

          Notes on borderline items: Several Florence-related promises are reinforced socially (Florence is socially accepted and credited), but the formal institutional questions about her exile, record, and the admissibility of her earlier fabricated advice were not settled here — those remain open. Similarly Scout's emotional role is strongly reaffirmed (paid off as an enacted emotional anchor), but the "limits and formalization" of Scout's role remain an ongoing aspect of the community fabric.

          Decision rationale for classifications: I marked as fulfilled only those previous open promises that the passage directly resolved or explicitly demonstrated (Kira's decision, the existence and enactment of community support, Scout's companion role). I carried forward systemic, institutional, and strategic promises because the passage either did not address them, only reinforced social facets, or introduced new complications that make them more important going forward. No prior promise was explicitly abandoned in this passage.

        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="KIRA_IMMINENT_RESIDENCY_DECISION">Kira faced a short-term decision whether to accept rescue or stay with the plant community — in this passage she chooses to stay and commits to telling the freighter in person.</promise>

          <promise id="REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS">Remedy's shift toward comfort/olfactory chemistry improves habitability but raises sustainability and priority questions that remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_HUMAN_ERGONOMICS_INTEGRATION">Velvet's incorporation of human ergonomics into biological growth has ongoing implications for cross‑species design tradeoffs and future projects; formalization and resource needs remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_GOVERNANCE_INSTITUTIONALIZATION">Day‑to‑day collaborative norms are practiced; whether these norms will be formalized into governance, crediting, exile/forgiveness procedures, or face pushback remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBLE_LEAVING_CONFLICT">Although Kira has decided to stay personally, the political/policy consequences of refusing extraction (how the freighter/human authorities will respond) and wider social fallout remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_TECH_COMMUNICATIONS_CAPABILITY">The plants' demonstrated ability to integrate biological growth and chemistry for radio communications is proven; the tactical, exposure, and future-usage implications remain open.</promise>

          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">(Carried forward duplicate removed elsewhere) The passage reinforces social trust but leaves institutional reconciliation open.</promise>

          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_EVOLUTION_FROM_SOCIAL_CHANGE">Kira's choice intensifies the promise that leadership/roles will evolve as the community admits non-plant members — a process that will create new governance questions.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_PERSONAL_IDENTITY_ARC">Kira's decision introduces a clear long-term character arc: the narrative will now follow consequences of choosing belonging over species-aligned familiarity.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_RESPONSE_AND_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE">New near-term plot promise: when Kira tells the arriving freighter she is staying, their institutional/public response (extraction pressure, reporting, legal/political fallout) will become a central conflict.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP_FORMALIZATION">With Kira choosing to stay, the community will now confront the need to formalize membership, rights, duties, and conflict-resolution procedures.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_WILL_TELL_FREIGHTER_IN_PERSON">Immediate, concrete near-term beat introduced here: Kira will inform the freighter at arrival that she refuses extraction — sets up an on-the-ground scene and possible diplomatic/legal consequences.</promise>
          <promise id="CULTURAL_SHIFT_TOWARD_INDIVIDUAL_VALUATION">Kira's decision promises to catalyze a longer-term cultural shift where individual voices (including non-plants) are valued — the durability and limits of that shift remain to be tested.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_LONG_TERM_ATTACHMENT">Scout's deep emotional bond and its implications (family status, possible conflict points if outside actors intervene) are now an explicit ongoing narrative factor.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_REHABILITATION_ARC">Florence's redemption is reinforced; her continuing arc — potential institutional rehabilitation or lingering consequences — remains a narrative thread.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage records a major, long-term decision and the emotional/social consequences that will affect later scenes: Kira explicitly chooses to remain with the plant community and plans to tell the arriving freighter in person, which changes her trajectory (no longer awaiting rescue/return). It also records community-level acceptance phrased as full membership (Holloway's explicit offer) and Scout's strong preference and emotional stakes — all details a reader or later chapter would need to keep consistent. Other exchanges (Runner/Velvet/Remedy/Florence gratitude and change narratives, Buddy's analysis) reinforce established character arcs but mostly confirm earlier developments rather than introduce contradictions. No contradictions with prior facts were found.</reasoning>
        <established>

        <reasoning>Temporal cues inside the passage: the narrator opens with "I spend the next two days talking to everyone," and later references "the second day," "the evening of the second day," and "tomorrow the freighter arrives." From the previous passage we know the freighter gave an ETA of "approximately forty‑eight hours" and the previous passage ended at ~18:15. The current passage therefore begins immediately after that moment and covers the narrator's interactions over the ensuing two days, concluding the night before the freighter's arrival (the narrator plans to tell the freighter "tomorrow"). There is a small internal wobble — the narrator briefly miscounts days ("third day—wait, no. The second day") and the phrasing sometimes reads as if two full days have passed and yet the freighter is still due "tomorrow." This is plausibly a subjective fuzziness of perception rather than a plot‑breaking contradiction. All events described (multiple private conversations spread over two days, final decision the evening before arrival) are achievable in the time given.</reasoning>
        <starts>~18:15 (immediately after previous passage)</starts>
        <ends>~18:15 (approximately 48 hours later; the evening before the freighter's arrival)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — the passage continues immediately from the previous scene. The narrator then spends roughly two days (≈48 hours) in conversations and reflection.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Spending two days conducting multiple in‑depth conversations and reaching a decision by the night before the rescue is reasonable. The only minor issue is the narrator's inconsistent internal accounting of "days" (a brief self-correction from "third" to "second" and the phrasing that could imply an extra day), but that is consistent with subjective time perception and does not undermine plausibility.</plausibility>

        <reasoning>The narrator (Kira) speaks with Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout and Buddy throughout the passage; each is named and interacts directly. All of these were listed as present at the end of the previous passage, so none are newly entering relative to the scene's start, and none explicitly leave before the passage ends. The plant community / setting corresponds to the known location entity /world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so I include that as the relevant entity.</reasoning>

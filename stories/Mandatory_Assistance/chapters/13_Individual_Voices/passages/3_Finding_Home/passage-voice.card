  <reasoning>
    Reviewing the passage for voiceover adjustments: 
    1. Staccato sentences: Several short fragments (e.g., "Not saying goodbye, exactly.") should be merged for smoother speech. 
    2. Dialog speaker cues: Some lines of dialog follow action without a clear lead-in; I made every spoken line follow a clear "[Speaker] says," or narrator lead-in. 
    3. Ambiguous pronouns: Kept speaker IDs (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, I) clear to avoid confusion in audio. 
    4. Pauses: Added em dashes and ellipses where the text suggested medium or trailing pauses. 
    5. Formal/stilted text: Light smoothing of sentence joins to read naturally while preserving meaning. 
    6. Symbols/non-text: No special symbols to convert, aside from preserving punctuation for pauses. 
    I did not change story content, only adapted wording and punctuation to fit the voiceover rules.

        I spend the next two days talking to everyone — not saying goodbye exactly, but examining what this place means, what they mean, what I mean to them.

        Runner finds me first, emerging from underground where they've been working on a new resonance design.

        Runner says, "Kira. Can we talk?"

        I say, "Of course."

        Runner's vines settle into a comfortable position.

        Runner says, "I've been thinking about when you leave — if you leave — and I wanted to say… *you changed how I see myself.*"

        I say, "How?"

        Runner says, "Before the battle I followed protocols — underground construction guidelines, standard network designs. Then you asked about my tactical intelligence, and Florence actually listened — it made me realize I could contribute beyond just executing orders."

        I say—gesturing at the acoustic chambers—"You've created incredible things. Art and function together."

        Runner says, "Because I learned that individual perspective has value — you helped me understand that." Runner's vines shift.

        Runner says, "If you decide to go back to your people, I'll miss that — the way you see things differently and aren't afraid to share it. But I also understand that humans probably need other humans."

        I say, "Do they, though?"

        Runner tilts thoughtfully, then says, "I don't know. Do you?"

        I admit, "That's the question, isn't it? I don't know either — that's what I'm trying to figure out."

        Runner says, "Whatever you choose — thank you for helping me find confidence in my own voice."

        Later, Velvet finds me in one of the spaces they created — comfortable seating, pleasant proportions, designed with human needs in mind.

        Velvet shows me a new growth structure and says, "I've been working on this."

        It's beautiful — translucent layers creating light patterns, functional strength with artistic sensibility.

        I say—honestly—"It's amazing."

        Velvet says, "You taught me that beauty serves purpose. Before, I thought aesthetics were frivolous; function was what mattered. But you kept asking about how spaces feel, not just whether they're structurally sound — visual interest, comfortable proportions, pleasing textures."

        I say, "You already had the ability. I just asked questions."

        Velvet's growth rustles.

        Velvet says, "Questions that made me think differently about what I create — the spaces we designed together are better because they consider human perspective alongside plant function. You contributed to that. Whatever you decide about the freighter, I want you to know: *your voice shaped this community in ways that will last.*"

        I touch the translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns. My feedback helped create this. *My voice mattered in its design.*

        Remedy approaches while I'm examining the enhancement compounds they've developed — scents and colors and subtle environmental improvements.

        Remedy says without preamble, "*Chemistry can serve joy.* I never understood that before you. Science was survival — necessary compounds, emergency responses, protocol compliance."

        I ask, "What changed?"

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Intimate, reflective, gentle pacing with modest pauses for emphasis and transition between speakers.

        - Read the opening line measured and thoughtful: "I spend the next two days talking to everyone — not saying goodbye exactly..."
        - For dialog, clearly voice the speaker tag first, then the quote. Pause slightly after each "[Name] says," before speaking the quote.
        - Emphasize the bolded phrases as slightly stronger: "*you changed how I see myself.*" and "*your voice shaped this community in ways that will last.*"
        - Use a softer, curious tone for questions: "Do they, though?" and "What changed?"
        - When the text uses em dashes for stage directions—e.g., "I say—gesturing at the acoustic chambers—"—perform the parenthetical action briefly, then continue.
        - For Runner and Velvet, use warm, appreciative tones; for Remedy, a more matter-of-fact but surprised gentle tone when saying "*Chemistry can serve joy.*"
        - End the passage with a slight upward inflection on the question "What changed?" to leave it open and inquisitive.

        Remedy says, "You asked about human-safe fragrances. But it made me realize chemistry could enhance life, not just preserve it — your questions challenged my assumptions about what I could create — made me a better scientist."

        «Such a trivial question.»

        Remedy's edges shift with what might be satisfaction.

        I say, "You made my life better — these enhancements make this place comfortable, not just survivable."

        Remedy says, "Exactly — comfortable matters as much as survivable. You taught me that."

        —

        Remedy says, "If you leave, I'll miss your questions — they push me to think beyond protocol. But I also understand that humans might need human-appropriate environments more than plant-enhanced ones."

        Do I, though?

        This plant-enhanced environment feels more like home than any human space I've lived in.

        Holloway finds me on the second day. Time is moving faster than I realize. The freighter arrives tomorrow.

        Holloway says, "Kira — we need to talk about your decision."

        I say, "I'm still thinking."

        Holloway says, "I know — but I want to make something clear."

        Holloway's bioluminescence brightens.

        Holloway says, "You're part of this community — not as guest, not as temporary refugee — as an actual member whose voice shapes our collective direction. If you choose to stay, that's not charity or accommodation — it's us keeping someone we value."

        I say, "And if I choose to leave?"

        Holloway says, "We'll be sad — Scout especially will be heartbroken. But we'll support it — because belonging means choosing to be here, not feeling trapped here."

        —

        Holloway says, "Whatever you decide, know that your voice mattered — you changed us. Made us better at being a community that values individual contributions."

        I admit, "You changed me too."

        Holloway says, "Then we're even — make the choice that serves you, Kira. Not what you think you should want — what you actually want."

        What I actually want.

        ¶

        I'm sitting in one of Velvet's comfortable spaces, Scout curled up beside me, thinking about tomorrow.

        Florence asks, "May I join you?"

        I say, "Please."

        Florence says, "I owe you something."

        I ask, "What?"

        Florence says, "Perspective. When I was exiled, I believed redemption was impossible — that past mistakes defined me forever, that I'd always be the person who betrayed everyone's trust. You didn't accept that."

        I say, "I just asked you to help."

        Florence says, "You believed I could choose right action even when I doubted it — that belief changed everything. It gave me space to become someone who empowers rather than controls, someone whose present choices matter despite past failures."

        Florence's platform shifts.

        Florence says, "Now you're facing a choice about who you are and where you belong — I want you to have the same freedom I did: to choose based on who you want to be, not who you think you should be."

        I say, "You think I should stay." It's not a question.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Intimate and reflective — measured delivery, with soft warmth for affectionate lines and gentle firmness for practical counsel. Use medium pauses at the em dashes and a long, dramatic pause at the paragraph with only "¶".

        - Read "Remedy says, "You asked about human-safe fragrances..."" with quiet surprise and a mild, pleased curiosity.
        - Pause briefly at every "—" and treat it as a beat of thought; do not rush through those breaks.
        - At the paragraph containing only "¶", take a noticeably longer pause (let the silence linger) before continuing into the next sentence.
        - Voice Holloway warmly and sincerely — "Holloway says, 'Kira — we need to talk...'" should feel grounding and gently persuasive; brighten the tone slightly for the sentence about community value.
        - For the narrator lines like "Do I, though?" and "What I actually want.", use inward, questioning inflection — more reflective than outward-facing.
        - Florence's lines should be steady and earnest — deliver the redemption lines with calm conviction; for "I owe you something," make a soft, deliberate beat before revealing the rest.
        - When a line begins with "I say," or similar lead-ins, pause a fraction after the lead-in before the quoted text, so the speaker tag reads naturally.

        Florence says, "I think you belong here — but that's different from 'should.' Belonging only works if you choose it freely — otherwise it's obligation, not authentic connection. When I helped out of exile, it was because I chose to — that choice mattered more than all the complex reasoning. You gave me freedom to choose. I'm giving you the same." 

        I say, "Thank you." 

        Florence says, "Whatever you decide — you changed my life. You gave me a chance at redemption I didn't think possible. That matters regardless of where you physically exist." 

        Scout, who has been listening to all of this, waits until the second evening and finally demands full attention. We're alone in my sleeping area — still mostly intact from before, but now softened by Remedy's comfortable scents and Velvet's moss improvements. 

        Scout says (bouncing), "I know — are you going to leave? — I don't know yet — maybe — I'm happy if you're happy, but I'll be heartbroken if you go — I want you to stay, but I want you to choose what's right for you." 

        I say, "You're the best, you know that?" 

        Scout says (modest), "I just love Kira — always will — even if you go away." 

        I say, "I love you too." Scout cuddles close. 

        This tiny plant who adopted me immediately — who has given unconditional affection and loyalty and sees me as family without complication or condition. If I leave, I'll miss Scout most of all — but if I stay, Scout and I continue exactly as we are: family. That thought sits heavy and warm in my chest. 

        ¶

        I think, "Buddy — help me think through this." 

        Buddy says, "Of course, Kira. What do you need?" 

        I say, "I keep waiting for Mav's voice in my head to tell me what to do — some Uncharted wisdom about the brave choice or the universe rewarding boldness — but it's quiet." 

        Buddy says, "Is that bad?" 

        I say, "I don't think so. I think it means I'm not treating this like an episode anymore — this is my actual life, and Mav doesn't have answers for my actual life." 

        Buddy says softly, "That sounds like growth — you're trusting yourself instead of a character." 

        I say, "Yeah. Maybe. So help me think — not data analysis — just... think with me. Human civilization versus here." 

        Buddy is quiet for a moment. "When you were in human civilization, did anyone ask what you thought about how spaces should feel? Did anyone shape their work around your perspective? Did anyone make you furniture based on conversations you had? Create scents to make you comfortable? Build singing chambers partly because you wondered what underground art might sound like?" 

        I say, "No." 

        Buddy says, "And here?" 

        I say, "Here I'm Kira. My voice shapes things." 

        Buddy says, "Then I don't think you need data analysis — I think you already know." 

        What do I want?

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Intimate and reflective — warm, measured delivery; allow small bright moments for Scout and resolute softness for Florence and Buddy.

        - Read "Florence says, \"I think you belong here — but that's different from 'should.'\"" with steady earnestness; use a medium pause at the em dash before the explanation.
        - For "I say, \"Thank you.\"" deliver quietly — a gentle, grateful tone.
        - Read Scout's block, "Scout says (bouncing), \"I know — are you going to leave? ...\"" with a light, quick cadence; let the em dashes act as short, playful beats; keep the overall feeling warm and vulnerable.
        - When the line reads "Scout cuddles close," soften and slow slightly — a tender close physical beat.
        - At the paragraph that contains only "¶", take a long dramatic pause — let silence linger before continuing.
        - Deliver Buddy's lines with calm, encouraging gentleness; for "Buddy says softly, \"That sounds like growth...\"" emphasize "growth" with a touch of warmth and small uplift.
        - End with the final internal question, "What do I want?" as an inward, searching whisper — reflective and unresolved.

        I think about returning to human civilization — finding a new courier job, probably, or some other bureaucratic position; a functional existence among my own species. I'd have processed food again, medical technology, other humans to talk to about human things.

        But would any of them care about my individual perspective? Would my voice shape their decisions? Would I be Kira, or would I be employee number three thousand eight hundred forty-seven — a replaceable cog in an efficient machine?

        I think about staying here: a weird plant community where my human perspective genuinely matters — where my voice contributes to acoustic chambers and aesthetic design and enhancement chemistry and community decisions. Where I'm not just present, I'm valued.

        Where Scout loves me unconditionally — where Florence found redemption partly because I believed in her — where Runner discovered confidence, Velvet found artistic purpose, Remedy learned joy, and Holloway leads by empowering. Where individual voices create a harmony that's richer than any protocol could design.

        The absurd irony of it is this: bureaucratic alien plants created more authentic human community than the humans did — because they value individual voices, including mine.

        I say quietly, "I think I know what I want."

        Scout bounces — a hopeful question.

        I say, "I want to stay."

        Scout explodes in happy bounces — joyful bounce, relief bounce, family-staying-together bounce.

        "But I need to be sure," I add — really, truly sure — "because once I make this choice, I'm committing to it."

        Scout bounces understanding — take time, be certain, yet hoping so hard.

        I sit with it. The decision.

        ¶

        Tomorrow the freighter arrives — human rescue, return to civilization.

        Or — home. Real home. Where my voice matters.

        The choice isn't actually hard. It should be — species loyalty, human connection, familiar culture — those should matter. But what actually matters is being valued for who I am: contributing uniquely, having a voice that shapes the community I live in.

        Belonging. Real belonging.

        I tell Scout, "I'm sure — I want to stay here. This is home."

        Scout bounces the happiest bounce I've ever seen, then bounces a question: telling the freighter tonight?

        I say, "Tomorrow. When they arrive, I'll tell them in person that I'm choosing to stay."

        Scout bounces approval — proper choice bounce, respectful bounce.

        I ask, "You think so?"

        Scout bounces emphatic yes — they deserve to know I'm choosing freely, not being held against my will; clear communication bounce, human courtesy bounce.

        "When did you get so wise?" I ask.

        Scout bounces modest — just common sense.

        I settle into my sleeping area: comfortable moss, pleasant scents, acoustic chambers humming gentle harmonics through the facility — individual voices creating collective harmony. And my voice is part of that harmony now.

        Not temporary visitor. Not protected refugee. Part of the community. Home.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Quietly reflective and warm — measured delivery with small bright, quick rhythms for Scout's bounces; allow one long silent beat before the choice is revealed.

        - Read the opening paragraph with calm, steady introspection; let the em dashes create a gentle pause between clauses.
        - For the rhetorical questions about being Kira or employee number three thousand eight hundred forty-seven, slow slightly on each question to let the weight land.
        - Read the list of "Where..." lines as one flowing sentence separated by soft em-dash beats — rising warmth as you reach the final line of that paragraph.
        - When you say, "I think I know what I want," use a low, intimate tone; then make Scout's reactions light and quick — "Scout bounces — a hopeful question." should sound playful and brief.
        - At the paragraph that contains only "¶", take a long dramatic pause — let silence lengthen before saying "Tomorrow the freighter arrives."
        - Deliver the final decision — "I'm sure — I want to stay here. This is home." — with gentle conviction; close the ending lines with a peaceful, contented softness.
        - Keep Scout's bounces as nonverbal, physical cues with a bright, quick cadence whenever they appear.

        Tomorrow I'll tell the freighter — thank them for coming, but explain I'm staying. I've found a place here, a community that values me — a home that actually feels like home.

        They might think I'm crazy — a human choosing to live with alien plants instead of returning to civilization.

        But I know the truth.

        I'm choosing *belonging* over familiarity — _authentic connection_ over demographic similarity — *home* over origin.

        My voice matters here — in ways it never did before, in ways I didn't know were possible. That's worth more than any bureaucratic human system.

        Scout curls up beside me — content bounce — happy bounce — family bounce.

        Tomorrow the freighter arrives. Tomorrow I make my choice official.

        But tonight, I sleep peacefully in the weird, wonderful plant facility that became home when I wasn't looking — where individual voices create harmony, and where mine belongs.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Quiet, reflective, and warm — measured delivery, with quick bright rhythms for Scout's bounces and a gentle, lingering close.

        - Read the opening sentence calmly; use a medium pause at the em dash in "Tomorrow I'll tell the freighter — thank them for coming, but explain I'm staying."  
        - Slightly emphasize "*belonging*" and "*home*" — make those words carry a little more weight while keeping the delivery intimate.  
        - Use em-dash beats as medium pauses for the comparisons: deliver "I'm choosing *belonging* over familiarity — _authentic connection_ over demographic similarity — *home* over origin" as one flowing, rising sequence.  
        - For "My voice matters here — in ways it never did before," ease into it — a soft, astonished warmth before the next line.  
        - Make Scout's bounces quick and playful on the words "content bounce — happy bounce — family bounce"; they should be light and brief.  
        - Keep "Tomorrow the freighter arrives. Tomorrow I make my choice official." steady, clear — slight pause between the two "Tomorrow" lines to mark resolve.  
        - Close with a peaceful, contented softness on "...where individual voices create harmony, and where mine belongs."
        - Soft landing; warm fall, lingering last syllable, cozy pause

If I leave, I'll miss Scout most of all — but if I stay, Scout and I continue exactly as we are: family. That thought sits heavy and warm in my chest. 

    I think, "Buddy — help me think through this." 

    Buddy says, "Of course, Kira. What do you need?" 

    I say, "I keep waiting for Mav's voice in my head to tell me what to do — some Uncharted wisdom about the brave choice or the universe rewarding boldness — but it's quiet." 

    Buddy says, "Is that bad?" 

    I say, "I don't think so. I think it means I'm not treating this like an episode anymore — this is my actual life, and Mav doesn't have answers for my actual life." 

    Buddy says softly, "That sounds like growth — you're trusting yourself instead of a character." 

    I say, "Yeah. Maybe. So help me think — not data analysis — just... think with me. Human civilization versus here." 

    Buddy is quiet for a moment. "When you were in human civilization, did anyone ask what you thought about how spaces should feel? Did anyone shape their work around your perspective? Did anyone make you furniture based on conversations you had? Create scents to make you comfortable? Build singing chambers partly because you wondered what underground art might sound like?" 

    I say, "No." 

    Buddy says, "And here?" 

    I say, "Here I'm Kira. My voice shapes things." 

    Buddy says, "Then I don't think you need data analysis — I think you already know." 

    What do I want?

    I think about returning to human civilization — finding a new courier job, probably, or some other bureaucratic position; a functional existence among my own species. I'd have processed food again, medical technology, other humans to talk to about human things.

    But would any of them care about my individual perspective? Would my voice shape their decisions? Would I be Kira, or would I be employee number three thousand eight hundred forty-seven — a replaceable cog in an efficient machine?

    I think about staying here: a weird plant community where my human perspective genuinely matters — where my voice contributes to acoustic chambers and aesthetic design and enhancement chemistry and community decisions. Where I'm not just present, I'm valued.

    Where Scout loves me unconditionally — where Florence found redemption partly because I believed in her — where Runner discovered confidence, Velvet found artistic purpose, Remedy learned joy, and Holloway leads by empowering. Where individual voices create a harmony that's richer than any protocol could design.

    The absurd irony of it is this: bureaucratic alien plants created more authentic human community than the humans did — because they value individual voices, including mine.

    I say quietly, "I think I know what I want."

    Scout bounces — a hopeful question.

    I say, "I want to stay."

    Scout explodes in happy bounces — joyful bounce, relief bounce, family-staying-together bounce.

    "But I need to be sure," I add — really, truly sure — "because once I make this choice, I'm committing to it."

    Scout bounces understanding — take time, be certain, yet hoping so hard.

    I sit with it. The decision.

    Tomorrow the freighter arrives — human rescue, return to civilization.

    Or — home. Real home. Where my voice matters.

    The choice isn't actually hard. It should be — species loyalty, human connection, familiar culture — those should matter. But what actually matters is being valued for who I am: contributing uniquely, having a voice that shapes the community I live in.

    Belonging. Real belonging.

    I tell Scout, "I'm sure — I want to stay here. This is home."

    Scout bounces the happiest bounce I've ever seen, then bounces a question: telling the freighter tonight?

    I say, "Tomorrow. When they arrive, I'll tell them in person that I'm choosing to stay."

    Scout bounces approval — proper choice bounce, respectful bounce.

    I ask, "You think so?"

    Scout bounces emphatic yes — they deserve to know I'm choosing freely, not being held against my will; clear communication bounce, human courtesy bounce.

    "When did you get so wise?" I ask.

    Scout bounces modest — just common sense.

    I settle into my sleeping area: comfortable moss, pleasant scents, acoustic chambers humming gentle harmonics through the facility — individual voices creating collective harmony. And my voice is part of that harmony now.

    Not temporary visitor. Not protected refugee. Part of the community. Home.

    Tomorrow I'll tell the freighter — thank them for coming, but explain I'm staying. I've found a place here, a community that values me — a home that actually feels like home.

    They might think I'm crazy — a human choosing to live with alien plants instead of returning to civilization.

    But I know the truth.

    I'm choosing *belonging* over familiarity — _authentic connection_ over demographic similarity — *home* over origin.

    My voice matters here — in ways it never did before, in ways I didn't know were possible. That's worth more than any bureaucratic human system.

    Scout curls up beside me — content bounce — happy bounce — family bounce.

    Tomorrow the freighter arrives. Tomorrow I make my choice official.

    But tonight, I sleep peacefully in the weird, wonderful plant facility that became home when I wasn't looking — where individual voices create harmony, and where mine belongs.

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage resolves Kira's central choice: after two days of conversations she decides to stay with the plant community rather than be extracted by the human freighter. That concrete decision pays off the prior open promise about her becoming a permanent member, and it reframes many social threads but does not eliminate background world threats or resource/repair needs. No battlefield or logistical threats were directly addressed here, so those remain relevant. The community's inclusion and trust dynamics are strongly reinforced (several prior tentative promises are strengthened), but these remain open as longer-term processes rather than fully resolved plotlines. New near-term promises are set up around Kira formalizing her decision with the arriving freighter and the durability of the cultural changes she inspired. I mark as fulfilled the explicit prior open promise that expected Kira's long-term membership when she actually chooses to stay; I do not mark other social promises as fulfilled because they describe durable trends or conditional risks that are still unresolved. I also do not mark any of the older background/hostile-threat promises as lapsed because the story has not moved past those risks or explicitly contradicted them — they remain relevant world-building threads.</reasoning>

      <promise id="COMMUNITY_CHANGES_PERSIST" tentative="true" introduced="40">Several members assert that Kira's influence (aesthetic priorities, valuing individual voices, new practices) has reshaped the group; whether these cultural changes persist long-term is an open, tentative promise.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_RESPONSE_TO_KIRA_DECISION" tentative="true" introduced="40">How the freighter and human institutions will react to Kira's decision (social, professional, bureaucratic consequences) is unresolved and may have future narrative impact.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selects only long-term, non-transient developments that will affect character relationships, decisions, and future plot (not scene-level details). Key new facts: Kira moves from intending to stay to actually deciding to stay and plans to decline the freighter extraction in person; multiple core plant-community members explicitly credit Kira with changing them and express supportive acceptance of her as a member; Kira no longer defers to the Uncharted/Maverick narrative for major life decisions and is trusting her own judgment. No statements in the passage contradict previously established facts, so no conflicts are recorded.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_MAKES_FINAL_DECISION_TO_STAY">Kira decides she will remain at the plant facility long-term and not accept extraction by the arriving freighter.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_WILL_DECLINE_EXTRACTION_IN_PERSON">Kira intends to tell the arriving freighter in person, upon its arrival the next day, that she is choosing to stay rather than be extracted.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_MULTIPLE_COMMUNITY_MEMBERS_EXPLICITLY_ACKNOWLEDGE_KIRA_IMPACT">Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, and Florence each directly state that Kira changed how they think and create, crediting her influence and expressing support for her—reinforcing her social integration and long-term importance to the community.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_STOPS_LIVING_BY_UNCHARTED_CUES">Kira recognizes that she no longer treats Uncharted/Maverick catchphrases as decision-making guidance; she is beginning to trust her own judgment rather than seeking Mav-style 'episode' answers.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: The previous passage ended when the freighter acknowledged the signal and gave an ETA of "approximately forty‑eight hours," and the narrator was told they had "Two days to decide." The current passage opens with "I spend the next two days talking to everyone," and the narrative covers conversations across those two days, ending the night before the freighter's arrival when the narrator decides to stay. There is a small in‑text slip where the narrator corrects themselves ("the third day—wait, no. The second day"), but that reads as a momentary miscount, not a substantive temporal contradiction. Duration: about 48 hours. Contextual events (multiple conversations, reflection, and a decision) fit into that span. No implausible actions are crammed into an unrealistically short window; the characters are mostly talking and reflecting, which matches the stated two‑day interval.</reasoning>
    <starts>2687-05-14T18:00</starts>
    <ends>2687-05-16T18:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — the passage continues immediately from the previous passage's end (the previous passage ended 2687-05-14T18:00 and this passage begins then).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The stated two‑day interval matches the freighter's ~48‑hour ETA and the events described (extended conversations, visits from multiple community members, and a decision reached the night before arrival). The only minor issue is the narrator's momentary miscount of "third day—wait, no. The second day," which is a small, believable internal slip rather than a timing error that undermines the timeline.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present in the passage: Kira (narrator) and the members of the plant community and Buddy. The passage directly names Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout, Buddy, and the narrator Kira_Voss. No other named characters appear. The passage references 'Mav' / Maverick (as a remembered voice), which maps to the Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone entity; the planetary/setting entity Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet is included as a relevant location for the scene. Regarding entries/exits: the previous-present list shows the same eight characters were present at the end of the prior passage, and in this passage none of the characters are described as leaving before the scene ends (conversations happen but no explicit exits). Therefore the ENTERED and EXITED lists are empty.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage is primarily Kira's decision-making arc: she spends two days conversing with community members, each of whom credits her with changing their perspectives and affirms her membership. Those conversations confirm Kira's sense of belonging and lead her to decide to stay; she will tell the arriving freighter in person the next day. I added new bullets for the conversations, Scout's attachment, Buddy helping Kira trust herself, and the final decision. I consolidated ongoing reconstruction and role descriptions into one bullet to avoid repetition and removed the previous uncertainty about her deadline (she still has the freighter arrival, but now has chosen to remain). I retained earlier plot-critical events (crash, root-node battle, contact with Harmony Prospect) but tightened their wording to keep the summary compact and focused on items that matter going forward (not atmospheric detail).</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Mining shuttle crashed during approach; Kira Voss survived with AI Buddy and Scout active; SAM remains offline.
      - Hull breach revealed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; local plant collective sheltered survivors and used the shuttle as shelter.
      - Hostile plants coordinated assaults from an underground root command node; defenders improvised layered defenses, chemical traps, and located the node ~50 m east.
      - Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway and others forced the command node to surface; defenders destroyed and extracted the root mass, collapsing hostile coordination.
      - Victory incurred heavy damage and supply depletion; survivors were injured/exhausted but survived; Florence began reintegration from isolation.
      - Over subsequent weeks the group shifted from survival to cooperative recovery: Florence reintegrated; Buddy and Scout observed voluntary cooperation.
      - Facility reconstruction moved from restoring old protocols to co-designed shared spaces: plants and humans redesigned spaces for joint life; Runner repurposed underground networks for transit/communication/acoustic chambers; Velvet regrew structural living spaces with human feedback; Remedy developed environmental enhancements; Holloway coordinated non-authoritatively; Florence integrated defenses; Scout curated social artifacts and emotional support.
      - Buddy detected an artificial signal on the array; the community built a plant-based communications uplink (Velvet grew a directional antenna, Remedy applied conductive compounds, Runner configured underground amplification; Florence and Holloway coordinated integration; Scout provided emotional support).
      - Buddy contacted the commercial freighter Harmony Prospect; the ship acknowledged the signal, confirmed one survivor (Kira) and planned extraction in ~48 hours after receiving coordinates.
      - The community celebrated contact but Kira felt conflicted about leaving; Buddy's analysis showed her psychological well-being and sense of belonging had significantly improved since the crash.
      - In the two days before the freighter's arrival Kira held extended conversations with community members: Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway and Florence each credited Kira with prompting new perspectives and growth (tactical confidence, aesthetics, comfort-focused chemistry, inclusive leadership, redemption) and affirmed her as a true community member rather than a temporary guest.
      - Scout expressed unconditional attachment and fear of losing Kira; Buddy helped Kira realize she is choosing based on belonging and self-trust rather than external narratives or duty.
      - Kira decides to remain with the plant community; she will inform the arriving freighter in person the next day that she is choosing to stay.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage is a quiet, resolution-focused scene that converts earlier tension into intimate, interpersonal closure. The POV (Kira) moves from active uncertainty to reflective appraisal as she solicits testimony from the community about what she and they have become. The dominant feeling is affirmation—Kira receives concrete evidence that her presence changed people and systems, which resolves her inner conflict and allows a confident, peaceful decision to stay. For the reader the experience is warm and cathartic: suspense about her choice is released into relief and belonging. There are multiple emotional beats (reflection/validation → communal affirmation → decision/settling), not a single monotone. Nothing in the passage functions as a genuine surprise relative to earlier setup—the scene largely fulfills the arc that had been building—so there are no surprises to flag. Character development is concentrated but broad: Kira makes the definitive decision to stay (a decisive identity moment), and multiple secondary characters articulate growth that was seeded earlier (Runner’s voice, Velvet’s aesthetics, Remedy’s purposive chemistry, Holloway’s inclusive leadership, Florence’s hard-won humility, Scout’s unconditional devotion, Buddy’s role as reflective partner). Overall the scene resolves internal stakes (belonging vs extraction) by centering concrete interpersonal validation, which makes Kira’s choice feel earned and emotionally resonant for the reader.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="intimacy, acceptance">Reflective, intimate conversations: Kira spends time talking one-on-one with Runner, Velvet, Remedy and others to 'examine' what the place and people mean. The POV feels open, vulnerable, and gratified as each character credits her with changing them. The reader feels warmth and a sense of earned repair—relations that were once fractured now offer personal testimony of growth.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, joy">Communal affirmation: multiple allies (Holloway, Florence, Remedy, Velvet) explicitly validate Kira's value and describe concrete ways she shaped the facility and community. This sustained affirmation lifts Kira from doubt into hopeful possibility; the reader experiences uplift and a palpable, gentle joy as scattered threads of earlier arcs are acknowledged and woven into shared meaning.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, determination">Decision and settling: after weighing what others say and consulting Buddy and Scout, Kira chooses to stay. Her relief is quiet but profound—she commits to belonging. The POV's emotional tone is resolved and steady; the reader feels cathartic closure and relieved endorsement of the choice (it reads inevitable and earned rather than abrupt).</beat>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage resolves Kira's residency decision and records the social consequences of that choice — the single most significant long-term fact for the story going forward. It also documents her plan to inform the arriving freighter in person, and Scout's strong emotional reaction. Other beats (Runner/Velvet/Remedy/Holloway/Florence thanking Kira and describing how she changed them) reinforce pre-existing character arcs and community bonds but largely echo established developments; I record only the consolidated, long-term state changes that would matter in later chapters. I found no contradictions with the previously established facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_COMMITS_TO_STAY">Kira Voss decides to remain living with the plant community — she chooses to stay rather than accept extraction by the arriving freighter.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_WILL_TELL_FREIGHTER_TOMORROW">Kira plans to inform the Harmony Prospect (the arriving freighter) in person when it arrives the next day that she is choosing to stay.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_REACTION_TO_DECISION_HAPPY">Scout reacts with intense joy and relief to Kira's decision and affirms continued close companionship (emotional state: elated, relieved, attachment strengthened).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_MEMBERS_EXPLICITLY_ACKNOWLEDGE_KIRA_IMPACT">Multiple core community members (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence) personally acknowledge that Kira changed them/us — crediting her with concrete shifts (confidence, aesthetic/ergonomic design, chemistry for comfort, social inclusion/reintegration) and stating they will miss her if she leaves; the group expresses valuing her as an actual member rather than a temporary guest.</fact>

    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Time cues in the passage: the narrator opens with "I spend the next two days talking to everyone." In the previous passage the freighter ETA was given as "approximately forty‑eight hours" at 19:00. The current passage therefore begins immediately after that announcement and covers roughly the two‑day interval before the freighter arrives. The passage traces conversations across that span (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout) and ends the evening before the freighter's arrival, when the narrator decides to stay and plans to tell the crew the next day. There is a small internal slip: the narrator momentarily thinks "third day—wait, no. The second day," and later says "The freighter arrives tomorrow," which slightly conflicts with the earlier explicit "forty‑eight hours" ETA if you read "next two days" as consuming the full 48 hours. Overall the intended timeline is: start immediately after the previous passage (19:00), spend about two days in conversations, and finish the night before the scheduled pickup. The gap from the previous passage is effectively none (this is the continuous two‑day interval following it). The timing is plausible — two days is a reasonable amount of time for repeated, in‑depth interpersonal conversations and for the narrator to reach a major personal decision. The only issue is the minor inconsistency around "second/third day" and "tomorrow" versus the stated 48‑hour ETA; it's a small narrative slip but does not create an implausible sequence of events.</reasoning>
    <starts>19:00 (immediately after the previous passage)</starts>
    <ends>Approximately 48 hours later — the evening/night before the freighter's arrival (i.e., the night before the scheduled pickup; narrator plans to tell them the next day)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — this passage continues directly from the previous scene; it covers the two days following the previous passage's 19:00 time. During that interval the narrator talks with each community member, reflects, and arrives at a decision.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Spending two days in repeated conversations, reflection, and arriving at a firm decision about whether to stay or be rescued is realistic. The physical actions and interactions described fit the time given. Note the minor internal inconsistency (the narrator's flit between "third day" and "second day" and the phrasing "tomorrow the freighter arrives" vs. the earlier explicit 48‑hour ETA), but it does not materially undermine the sequence — it reads as a momentary confusion rather than a serious logical error.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present in the passage: Kira (narrator) appears throughout. Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout, and Buddy all appear and speak or are described interacting with Kira. No other named characters from the available list are referenced. The passage references the arriving freighter and the plant community/facility, but the only available entity in the provided list that is relevant is the Sector 7-Gamma-412 Planet. "Entered" should list characters who arrive during this passage but were not present at the start; according to the provided previous-present list, all characters who appear here were already present at the end of the previous passage, so none newly enter. No character is described as leaving before the passage ends, so there are no exits to record.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage describes Kira spending two days talking with the plant community before the freighter arrives, during which each plant (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence) explains how Kira changed their perspectives and affirms her membership. Scout reiterates attachment. Buddy reconfirms that Kira's well‑being is measurably higher in the plant community. Kira decides to stay and will inform the arriving freighter in person. I consolidated repetitive or atmospheric details from the previous summary (e.g., individual technical minutiae and decorative descriptions) and merged related governance/reconstruction points to keep the running summary focused on events that affect future choices and relationships.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural‑link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and stayed close to her.
      - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ coordination and a massive command node were neutralized; Runner and Remedy removed the node’s root system to prevent contamination.
      - Facility sustained heavy structural/resource damage; core life‑support and medical systems remain functional; key plants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) are injured or regenerating.
      - Governance changed after recovery: Holloway publicly acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically without dominating decisions.
      - Reconstruction is committee‑driven and species‑aware; plants repurposed roles for rebuilding (underground resonance/amplification, structural growth, environmental/chemical enhancements, social curation).
      - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal; the community built a directional antenna and integrated conductive/resonant systems (Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Florence, Holloway coordinated) and transmitted coordinates and Kira’s status.
      - Human commercial freighter Harmony Prospect acknowledged the signal, confirmed a survivor, and estimated extraction in ~48 hours (freighter now due to arrive imminently).
      - Kira felt conflicted about leaving; Buddy’s analysis showed her psychological well‑being and sense of purpose are significantly higher in the plant community than in human civilization.
      - Over two days Kira spoke individually with Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway and Florence; each credited her with changing their approaches (tactical voice, aesthetics, comfort/chemistry, inclusive leadership, chance at redemption) and affirmed she is a valued community member while supporting whatever she chooses.
      - Scout expressed unconditional attachment and preferred Kira stay; after reflecting on belonging versus familiarity, Kira decided to remain with the plant community and will tell the arriving freighter in person tomorrow.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: Kira moves from reflective uncertainty to clarified belonging and quiet resolve. The passage stages a series of intimate, validating conversations (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout, Buddy) that show how her presence changed the community and, in turn, how deeply the community has become part of her identity. This external affirmation forces the internal question—"What do I actually want?"—and resolves with a calm, deliberate decision to stay. Reader: feels warm, satisfied, and emotionally uplifted; there’s also a gentle bittersweetness because the choice sacrifices an expected return to human civilization. There are multiple beats: (1) communal affirmation and mutual transformation, (2) inward deliberation about values/loyalty, (3) decisive acceptance and peaceful relief. These reuse the story’s long-running motifs (belonging, acceptance, hope) but function as a culmination rather than repetitive padding—the arc feels like payoff and emotional resolution for long-built themes rather than redundant repetition.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="belonging, hope">Affirmation and recognition from the community. Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, and Florence each tell Kira how her questions and voice changed them and the facility, producing a warm sense that she truly matters here. POV experiences moved validation and belonging; reader experiences tenderness, satisfaction, and uplift as the found-family motif is reinforced and the plants are humanized as reciprocal companions.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, acceptance">Quiet, internal deliberation about what she actually wants. Kira weighs human familiarity, resources, and species loyalty against the depth of connection and meaningful contribution she found with the plants. POV feels tense curiosity shifting toward pragmatic acceptance as she tests her motives; reader feels engaged anticipation and ethical sympathy—watching the protagonist choose values over default obligations.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, belonging">Decisive emotional resolution: Kira chooses to stay. The final acceptance is calm and relieved—she claims membership rather than temporary refuge, and experiences a warm, settled sense of home. Reader feels cathartic relief, joy, and emotional closure: the long arc of mistrust and isolation resolves into durable belonging and hope for the group's future.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I compared the previous open-promises list to events in this passage and tracked which setups were explicitly resolved, which were reiterated and remain live, and which were effectively made moot by Kira's decision. The central concrete resolution here is Kira deciding to stay (the immediate stay-or-leave choice is made), and the community explicitly upholds its prior pledge of support—both were earlier open items and are now realized. The confirmed human freighter extraction plan (ETA ≈ 48 hrs) is rendered moot for this survivor by Kira's declaration to stay (the extraction promise is not carried out), so I mark that as lapsed. Many longer-term mysteries and logistical threats (crash/navigation causes, SAM, regional hazards, resources, potential hostile regrouping, political consequences of external contact) are untouched or only reinforced and therefore remain open. I also flagged a few new, small promises that the passage introduces and leaves unresolved: Kira will tell the freighter in person tomorrow (concrete), and softer possibilities about how the human vessel/bureaucracy will react and how Kira's staying will affect resource pressure (tentative).</reasoning>

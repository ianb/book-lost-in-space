  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the post-battle recovery from planning into enacted rebuilding and social normalization. Several prior setup threads are paid off: the group chose to repair and actively rebuild on-site; the empowerment style of leadership is enacted in everyday practice; the recovery planning moved into active implementation; and social reintegration (especially Florence's arc and Kira's inclusion) has demonstrably progressed to the point of functional reintegration. Many operational and strategic risks remain unresolved — resource limits, contamination, enemy motives and adaptation, long-term logistics, and individual medical/recovery trajectories — and several new decision points and tensions are introduced, most notably the detection of an artificial (possibly human) signal that forces a renewed choice about contact/rescue versus staying with the emergent community. New cultural/technical threads also appear: Runner's underground network is being reframed as aesthetic + functional (potential tactical implications), Remedy has expanded into quality-of-life production (raising allocation/resource questions), the built environment has been reshaped to permanently include human ergonomics, and Kira's felt sense of belonging is now a plotline that may be tested by the incoming signal. I therefore mark the clearly realized promises from the previous list as fulfilled, carry forward the unresolved operational and political threads, and add new promises created by the signal and the cultural/technical shifts of the rebuild.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="INFRASTRUCTURE_REPAIR_OR_RELOCATE_DECISION_IMMINENT">The group decided to repair in place and actively rebuild the facility by committee; the repair-or-relocate choice has been resolved in favor of on-site reconstruction.</promise>

      <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy's shift into enhancement/quality-of-life production raises downstream allocation and resource-tradeoff questions that remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_AFTERMATH_AND_COUNTERADAPTATION">Whether hostile plants will adapt (decentralize, change tactics) after losing the command node remains unknown and dangerous.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_OFFENSIVE_TACTIC_POTENTIAL">The tactic of forcing a command node to surface proved useful; whether it can be refined, institutionalized, or scaled remains to be determined.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_RECOVERY_AND_CAPACITY">Remedy is producing again but hasn't demonstrated full restoration of defensive production capacity; recovery timelines and bottlenecks persist.</promise>

      <promise id="AFTERMATH_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_REPAIR">Rebuilding is progressing in practice, but many infrastructure repair tasks remain incomplete and require coordination and materials.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_DISPOSAL_AND_CONTAMINATION_CLEANUP">The immediate removal of the command-node roots occurred earlier, but environmental contamination and safe long-term disposal are still outstanding.</promise>
      <promise id="RUNNER_NETWORK_ARTISTIC_TACTICAL_INTEGRATION">Runner's underground network has been repurposed as both art and functional space; this opens future possibilities for acoustic communication, early-warning integration, or cultural practices.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_ROLE_EXPANSION">Remedy's expansion into environmental enhancements and quality-of-life compounds raises questions about resource allocation, social value, and technical capacity going forward.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_FRIENDLY_DESIGN_INTEGRATION">Human ergonomics and preferences are being built into the facility's bones; whether this permanence holds and how it shapes interspecies space use remains an open social/technical thread.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_PRESSURE_FROM_COMFORTS">As the group produces comforts (scents, seating, artistic spaces), demand on growth resources and chemicals could create new trade-offs and political tensions.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only durable, story-relevant facts that will affect later scenes: changes to the facility's function/role, shifts in character roles/relationships, new capabilities the collective has developed, and a new external development (a possible artificial/human signal). I omitted transient, scene-level details (time of day, specific conversational lines, immediate actions) and anything already covered in the provided summary or earlier established facts. None of the newly recorded facts contradict the previously established timeline or states; they are developments or consolidations of trends already present in the history (post-battle recovery, collaborative dynamics, Florence's reintegration, Remedy/Runner/Velvet adapting), so I report no conflicts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_REBUILT_BY_COMMITTEE">Over the past three weeks the damaged facility has been substantially rebuilt through a collaborative, creative committee of plant entities that prioritize aesthetics, comfort, and multifunctional design rather than merely restoring old protocols.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_ACOUSTIC_RESONANCE_CHAMBERS">Runner has repurposed parts of the underground network to create acoustically-tuned 'resonance chambers'—architectural spaces that harmonize with voices and are intentionally designed for artistic/aesthetic effect.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_ACOUSTIC_NETWORK_MULTIPURPOSE">Runner's acoustic/resonance design is being integrated into facility systems as both aesthetic/artistic spaces and functional elements (e.g., potential early-warning/communication uses).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_DESIGNS_HUMAN_ERGONOMIC_FURNITURE">Velvet has redesigned growth to produce human-focused furnishings (seating with back support, appropriate heights, cushioning) based on Kira's ergonomic input and prototype references (e.g., crash pod seat).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_CURATED_GALLERY_ALCOVES">Scout has been helped to create deliberate, child-height alcoves/gallery spaces to display collected objects—Scout is contributing curated aesthetic/communal elements.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS_AND_SCENT_MARKERS">Remedy has expanded production from strictly survival compounds to environmental enhancements (aromatic compounds, pleasant scents) and is developing scent markers that can be used for communication and to indicate safe zones.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_COORDINATES_NONAUTHORITATIVELY">Holloway now functions as a coordinator/facilitator—moving between projects, connecting ideas, and enabling integration—rather than issuing top-down control over rebuilding decisions.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_DESIGN_INTEGRATES_HUMAN_PERSPECTIVE">Human feedback (Kira's comments on ergonomics, sight lines, lighting, etc.) has been explicitly incorporated into the facility's structural growth and design decisions, making spaces that reflect human needs as well as plant/network needs.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_CONSIDERED_PERMANENT_RESIDENT">Kira's social status in the collective has shifted from 'temporary visitor to be protected' to 'community member/resident'—both the collective and Kira herself view her as living here long-term, and she expresses a desire not to leave.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PARTICIPATING_INTEGRALLY">Florence is actively participating as an equal contributor in rebuilding and design (offering tactical integration and accepting feedback); her reintegration into communal work has progressed substantially since earlier trust fractures.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_SHIFT_TO_CREATIVE_COLLABORATION">The group's post-battle recovery has matured into an explicitly creative, cooperative culture where individual voices and specializations (Runner's acoustics, Velvet's design, Remedy's chemistry, Scout's curation, Holloway's coordination) are woven together to produce a new communal environment.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_DETECTED_POSSIBLE_ARTIFICIAL_HUMAN_SIGNAL">Buddy detected an unusual artificial signal that may be of human origin; the detection is known to Kira and the group and immediately alters the community's context (potential external contact/rescue).</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the passage are explicit and simple: it opens with “Three weeks since the battle.” That tells us the start point relative to the previous passage. The scene describes a single work/recovery day in which the group shows the tangible results of three weeks of reconstruction and social integration: redesigned rooms, new functions, testing of acoustic chambers, scent experiments, furniture prototypes, and the planning for further work (“Tomorrow we start on the western wing”). The narrative time covered by the passage itself is short — a single active day/evening: testing, conversation, a break, and then Buddy detecting an incoming signal which creates an immediate cliffhanger. So the passage begins three weeks after the battle and ends that same day, a few hours after the day’s work and rest period when the signal is detected.

      How much time passes in the gap: about 21 days (three weeks). During that gap the group repaired and refitted the facility, iteratively tested and adjusted features, established new routines, and deepened interpersonal/community bonds (Runner’s chambers, Velvet’s seating and alcoves, Remedy’s scents, Holloway coordinating, Florence integrating, Scout collecting). The end of the passage is immediate — the moment the possible human signal is detected — so only minutes pass from the last conversational beat to the cliffhanger.

      Pacing and plausibility: Overall plausible. Three weeks is a reasonable interval for meaningful repairs, new creative uses of existing systems, and the social changes described, given the plant characters’ regenerative/growth abilities and highly motivated, cooperative workforce. Emotional and social shifts (increased trust, inclusion, Florence’s integration) are consistent with repeated interactions over weeks. The day-in-scene pacing (tests, conversation, break, then abrupt discovery of a signal) feels natural and believable. Minor caveats: a complete structural overhaul of a thoroughly wrecked facility might take longer in a human context, but the plants’ growth and rapid collaborative work make the level of visible transformation described credible within the story’s premise.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>~three weeks after the battle (≈21 days later), late afternoon (~17:30)</starts>
    <ends>same day as it starts — later that afternoon / early evening (a few hours after the scene begins; approx ~18:30)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈21 days (three weeks). During the gap the group performed continuous recovery and rebuilding: removing hazards, repairing structure, redesigning spaces, testing acoustics/scents/furniture, and repeatedly practicing cooperative decision-making — all of which produced the transformed facility and social integration shown in the passage.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Three weeks is a believable interval for the social reconciliation and substantial, non‑structural rebuilding described given the plants’ rapid growth and concentrated labor. The single-day scene (testing, rest, and the sudden detection of a signal) is coherently paced; the final cliffhanger (a possible human signal) is an immediate event that reasonably changes the situation in an instant. Minor suspension of disbelief may be required for the extent of physical reconstruction in three weeks, but it fits the story’s established capabilities and tone.</plausibility>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the post-battle recovery into a new phase: three weeks later the plants have shifted from strict protocols to collaborative, creative rebuilding and have begun designing the facility around multiple species' needs. Key new facts to add: the facility is being rebuilt by committee; individual plants have repurposed roles (Runner: acoustic/resonance chambers; Velvet: ergonomic/aesthetic growth and furniture; Remedy: environmental/enhancement chemistry; Scout: social/curatorial role; Holloway: non-authoritative coordinator); Florence has moved from distrusted tactician to integrated, contributing member; Kira has been accepted as a permanent resident and is actively shaping design decisions; the group is planning the western wing together. The passage ends with Buddy detecting an artificial signal, possibly human, which introduces the possibility of external contact or rescue and immediately raises new stakes. I consolidated older, granular battle-tactic details (e.g., specifics of Runner/Remedy actions during the fight) into broader bullets about the attack being neutralized and the command node removed, preserved the still-relevant status of damage/resource depletion and intact core systems, and removed atmospheric/descriptive detail that doesn't affect plot progression.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal perimeter scout and stayed close to Kira.
      - Hostile plants mounted a coordinated assault that nearly overwhelmed defenders but was ultimately neutralized after a combined defender action severed attacker coordination.
      - A massive hostile command node surfaced inside the perimeter and was destroyed; Runner and Remedy removed its root system from the core to prevent toxic leakage.
      - Facility sustained heavy structural damage and resource exhaustion; core life-support and medical systems remain intact; Runner, Velvet and Remedy are injured/resource-depleted but regenerating or repairing.
      - Recovery brought harsher reckonings and renewed cooperation: Holloway publicly acknowledged Florence's past fabrication of pronouncements, invited her into the community for recovery, and Florence accepted—she has since reintegrated and is contributing tactically without dominating.
      - Three weeks after the battle the plants are rebuilding the facility by committee rather than restoring old protocols; creative, species-aware redesigns are underway.
      - Plants have repurposed roles during reconstruction: Runner is converting underground networks into functional, acoustic 'resonance' chambers; Velvet is shaping structural growth into ergonomic furniture and alcoves; Remedy is developing environmental enhancements (scents, comforts) beyond survival chemistry; Scout provides social glue and curatorial displays; Holloway coordinates non-authoritatively.
      - Kira has been incorporated as a permanent community member: her human needs and feedback are actively shaping design choices (ergonomics, sightlines, lighting, comfort) and she now feels she belongs.
      - The group is planning the next phase (western wing) through collaborative design, explicitly soliciting Kira's input as a resident rather than a guest.
      - Buddy detects an artificial communication signal—possibly human in origin—introducing the prospect of external contact or rescue and immediately changing the group's priorities.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage centers on a quiet, cumulative emotional shift in Kira from provisional survivor to integrated member of a living community — followed by a sudden reintroduction of external possibility (a human signal) that destabilizes that settled feeling. POV: Kira experiences a warm, almost stunned realization of belonging and acceptance as the plants intentionally redesign the facility around multiple needs (including hers). That feeling is accompanied by genuine wonder and modest joy at the creative, aesthetic rebuilding and a steady, practical hope about the future. Reader: experiences a comforting emotional payoff after the story's long arc of mistrust, isolation, and procedural frustration — relief, warmth, and satisfaction that trust and cooperation have matured into belonging. Then the final line (Buddy detects a possible human signal) injects a sharp, tense pivot: Kira's inward contentment converts immediately into anticipatory alarm and complicated dread about what rescue would mean. Pattern comparison: the passage continues and deepens previously established belonging/acceptance beats (repair of trust, community formation) but refreshes the pattern by showing creativity and domestic flourishing rather than mere survival. The closing anticipation/dread also repeats the story's recurrent motif of hope interrupted by threat or uncertainty, but here it acts as an emotional coda that complicates rather than undermines the new belonging.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: A profound, quiet realization that Kira is no longer a temporary guest but a member of the facility — her feedback and needs are integrated into the architecture. This produces an emotional swell: unsteady voice, tears-under-control, and a soft confidence. Cause: watching Velvet, Runner, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, and Scout deliberately design spaces for human needs and explicitly telling Kira she belongs. Reader: feels warm satisfaction and emotional payoff after the story's long arc of mistrust and loss; there's relief and tenderness at the repaired, mutual care.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, hope">POV: Joyful, curious appreciation at the facility's creative transformation — acoustic chambers that sing, aesthetic seating, scent chemistry, Scout's curated gallery — producing delight and pride in the group's collective inventiveness. Cause: plants moving beyond rigid protocols to make life pleasant and meaningful, and Kira's active participation in design decisions. Reader: experiences uplifted curiosity and pleasure (a restorative, almost domestic joy) that reframes the alien caretakers as collaborators rather than mere functionaries.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, dread">POV: A sudden, sharp pivot from contentment to alertness and inner conflict when Buddy reports an artificial signal of possible human origin. The possible rescue instantly destabilizes Kira's acceptance of this new home — hope for contact mingles with dread about losing the community she's come to love. Reader: feels a quick jolt of suspense and emotional ambivalence — renewed investment and anxiety about what the signal will mean for Kira and the community. Pattern note: This mirrors the story's recurring hope→threat dynamic but now complicates the freshly established belonging, making the motif feel consequential rather than repetitive.</beat>

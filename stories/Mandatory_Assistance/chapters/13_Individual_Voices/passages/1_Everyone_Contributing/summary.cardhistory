        <reasoning>
          Overview: This passage advances the social-repair and reconstruction arcs: three weeks after the battle the facility is actively and visibly being rebuilt by committee, with plant characters experimenting with aesthetic, functional, and human-centered design. Florence is no longer an isolated, distrusted coordinator—she contributes as an equal and is described as integral to community function. Runner and Remedy have recovered sufficiently to innovate (acoustics, scents), Velvet is producing human-oriented ergonomy and structure, Scout continues as social glue, Holloway coordinates without controlling, and Kira is explicitly being treated as a permanent member whose input shapes design. The final beat introduces a new, disruptive plot hook: Buddy detects an artificial signal, possibly human, which immediately changes the stakes.

          How I decided categories: I treated clear, enacted social changes (acceptance of Florence, sustained participatory leadership, Runner and Remedy functionality) as fulfilled narrative promises because the passage shows these setups paid off. Ongoing, systemic risks and resource/hostile-threat vectors (enemy adaptation, territorial markers, resource scarcity, long-term trust work, structural repair) remain active plotlines and so are carried forward. The new human-signal detection is a deliberate cliffhanger: it's ambiguous and thus a tentative but significant new promise. Several concrete, immediate projects (western wing design; Kira asked for ongoing input; cultural/aesthetic overhaul) are firm new commitments. I did not mark any prior promise as lapsed because the passage either fulfilled or reinforced previous setups rather than abandoning them.

          Notable payoffs: the passage pays off the interpersonal/leadership promises (Florence's reintegration and the group's move to shared authority) and the recovery of previously depleted agents (Runner, Remedy). New conflicts are seeded: the external signal which may invite rescue, threat, or other complications, and the long-term question of resource allocation and whether the new community will withstand future external pressures.

          Specifics follow: which previous promises were fulfilled, which remain open, and which (if any) lapsed, plus the new promises introduced in this passage.
        </reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_REBUILDING">Florence's reintegration into the group: she was invited into recovery and in this passage is fully participating, valued, and treated as a member rather than an exile.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_CRISIS">Florence's shift from controlling coordinator toward participatory membership: she now contributes as one voice among many and her role/authority has been redefined in practice.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_EACH_OTHER_OVER_ELDER">The tension over whether the group would defer to Florence versus rely on internal judgment is resolved in favor of shared authority; the group consistently integrates multiple voices.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_MEDICAL_NEEDS_UNCERTAIN">Runner's earlier injuries/regeneration: Runner is active, designing acoustic chambers and moving through the facility—evidence that their immediate medical/recovery needs have been met sufficiently to contribute.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_RECHARGE_DELAY">Remedy's earlier depletion and slow output: Remedy is now producing new environmental compounds and experimenting with scents—indicating recharge/functional recovery.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PARTICIPATORY_LEADERSHIP">The emergent pattern of Florence practicing enabling, participatory leadership (integrating others' ideas) has been enacted consistently and is now part of the group's working pattern.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS" tentative="false" introduced="29">Hostile plant aggression and perimeter probing remain relevant; the command node's destruction ended the immediate coordinated threat but territorial/perimeter threats still factor into defense placement and reconstruction.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBILITY_OF_POST_ATTACK_REPENTANCE_OR_RESENTMENT" tentative="true" introduced="32">The group has moved toward recognition and inclusion, but long-term forgiveness/resentment dynamics remain unresolved and may shift with time; processing of past hurt is ongoing.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_WITHDRAW_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="33">Florence previously threatened withdrawal if rejected; she accepted the invitation and now feels at home, but the behavioral risk (withdrawing if later rejected) remains a conditional vulnerability for future social dynamics.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTIVE_TACTICS" tentative="true" introduced="33">The hostiles previously displayed coordinated tactics via a command node; adaptive or decentralized tactics remain a plausible future threat vector even though that node was destroyed.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_SHORTAGE_THREAT" tentative="true" introduced="33">Despite creative flourishing, broader resource constraints (materials, growth mass, chemical supplies) and their impact on rebuilding and defense remain relevant to future choices and pace of repair.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_COOPERATION_TRACK_ADAPT" tentative="false" introduced="28">The habit of iterating tactics and tracking what works continues and is reinforced by committee-based rebuilding and cross-disciplinary experimentation.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_EXTENDED_SIEGE_EXPECTED" tentative="true" introduced="34">A longer-term campaign or renewed siege by hostiles remains a plausible threat—the immediate coordinated assault was defeated but the group must plan for future pressure.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXHAUSTION_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="34">Florence expended heavy effort previously; while she is now participating, exhaustion and reduced capacity remain an ongoing risk to her ability to sustain contributions.</promise>
          <promise id="STRUCTURAL_DAMAGE_REPAIR_NEEDS" tentative="true" introduced="34">The facility required serious repair; reconstruction is underway (and far along) but rebuilding remains an ongoing, practical project with future work (e.g., western wing).</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_PERIMETER_FAILURE_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="34">Velvet had been depleted and the perimeter vulnerable; Velvet is active and building structure, but perimeter resilience still depends on continued recovery and resource allocation.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_INTEGRATED_TACTICAL_ROLE" tentative="true" introduced="35">Buddy remains an observer/analyst whose commentary influences social perception; here Buddy detects a signal that catalyzes change—their informational role remains relevant.</promise>
          <promise id="POST_BATTLE_RESOURCE_CRISIS" tentative="true" introduced="36">Immediate post-battle shortages continue to constrain recovery planning (materials, medical supplies, chemical stockpiles) even as creative work progresses.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_TRUST_SOLIDIFICATION" tentative="true" introduced="36">Trust has strengthened markedly and is being practiced through cooperative rebuilding, but whether this becomes a durable, long-term equilibrium remains to be seen.</promise>
          <promise id="ENEMY_DECOUPLED_ADAPTATION" tentative="true" introduced="36">With the command node destroyed, the enemy could adapt by decentralizing coordination or using new modalities—this remains a plausible future threat scenario.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_TRUST_BUILDING_REQUIRED" tentative="true" introduced="37">The group explicitly framed forgiveness and full trust as a long-term process; that commitment to extended boundary-setting and time remains active.</promise>
          <promise id="STRUCTURAL_REPAIR_AND_RESOURCE_DRIVE" tentative="false" introduced="37">The passage affirms ongoing rebuilding and resource-acquisition needs (project planning, phased repairs like the western wing) and sets up further logistical work to come.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_INCLUSION_AS_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="37">Inclusion of Florence and Kira is being practiced as a community norm (designing for human needs, welcoming participation); whether it stabilizes as a durable social norm is still open but now strongly reinforced.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_BRIDGE_ROLE" tentative="true" introduced="37">Scout continues to act as an emotional/social bridge—their collecting, curating, and physical presence help knit the community; that role persists and remains relevant.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_PERMANENT_MEMBERSHIP_IN_COMMUNITY" tentative="false" introduced="38">Kira recognizes (and the group confirms) that she is now being designed-for as a permanent resident rather than a temporary guest; this sets up an ongoing personal stake in the community's future.</promise>
          <promise id="WESTERN_WING_DESIGN_PROJECT" tentative="false" introduced="38">Explicit, immediate plan to begin work on the western wing (they plan to start tomorrow), a concrete near-term project that will test collaborative design and resource allocation.</promise>
          <promise id="CULTURAL_RENOVATION_AND_AESTHETIC_INTEGRATION" tentative="false" introduced="38">The facility is being intentionally remade to include art, acoustics, scents, and human ergonomics—an ongoing cultural shift from bare survival to a life that includes beauty and comfort.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_ROLE_IN_DESIGN_AND_DECISIONS" tentative="false" introduced="38">Kira is explicitly asked for input on human needs (e.g., western wing design), indicating an ongoing role shaping the facility's form and function.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_SOLIDIFICATION_AS_HARMONY_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="38">The emergent pattern of co-creation and shared voice could solidify into a social norm of mutual respect and integrated design; this is promising but not guaranteed.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_SIGNAL_DETECTED_POSSIBLE_HUMAN_CONTACT" tentative="true" introduced="38">Buddy detects an artificial signal, possibly human in origin. This ambiguous contact is a sudden external plot hook that will likely force choices about rescue/contact/security and could upend the current sense of home.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage documents durable, story-relevant changes to the facility, the plant collective's roles and priorities, Kira's social status, and a new external plot cue. Key long-term items: Runner, Velvet, Remedy and others have repurposed recovery into a sustained cultural shift (artistic/ergonomic/aesthetic priorities) that changes defense and sensing architectures and the facility's habitability; Kira's feedback is now embedded in structural design and she psychologically commits to remaining; Buddy's detection of an artificial (possibly human) signal is a clear new external plot hook that will change stakes and decisions going forward. These facts affect future logistics, defense planning, resource priorities, Kira's motivations, and contact/rescue possibilities. There are no contradictions with previously established facts—the passage is a forward development of the group's recovery and social reintegration.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_RESONANCE_CHAMBERS">Runner has repurposed parts of the underground network into bowl-shaped resonance chambers—acoustic spaces that harmonize with human voices and are being developed for aesthetic use and as functional sensors/early-warning systems.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_DESIGNS_HUMAN_ERGONOMICS">Velvet has begun designing ergonomic furniture and human-oriented spatial elements (seating, alcoves, comfortable ceiling heights) based on direct consultation with Kira and prototype testing.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_CURATES_GALLERY">Scout has created a curated series of small alcoves/galleries at Scout-height to store and display collected items, serving a social/emotional and curatorial role in the facility.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS">Remedy's role has expanded beyond survival/medical chemistry to produce environmental 'enhancements' (experimental aromatic compounds, color/olfactory design) intended to improve daily comfort and to provide scent-based communication markers.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_COORDINATING_NOT_COMMANDING">Holloway is functioning as an enabling coordinator—facilitating connections among contributors and gathering input—rather than exercising top-down control during the rebuilding process.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FUNCTIONALLY_REINTEGRATED">Florence is actively participating in design and defensive planning as an equal contributor; her tactical input is accepted and she is functionally reintegrated into community tasks.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_DESIGN_INTEGRATES_KIRA_AS_RESIDENT">The facility's reconstruction explicitly incorporates Kira's needs and feedback into its structural design, indicating the collective treats her as a permanent resident rather than a temporary guest.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_EXPRESSES_INTENT_TO_STAY">Kira realizes she belongs in the community and states that she does not want to leave, indicating a personal decision to remain long-term.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_DETECTED_ARTIFICIAL_COMM_SIGNAL">Buddy detected an artificial signal on the facility's communication array, likely human in origin; this introduces an immediate potential for external contact or rescue and will alter group priorities.</fact>

      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Temporal cues: the passage opens with the explicit line “Three weeks since the battle.” The previous passage end time to use (authoritative) is 2687-04-23T19:00, so the start date can be calculated as 21 days later. No explicit time-of-day is given in the passage; the narrative content (people testing resonance chambers, daytime-style work, a “break time,” planning “tomorrow”) implies a daytime/working-period sequence that unfolds within a single day. The end of the passage is marked by Buddy detecting an incoming/artificial signal (possible human), which abruptly shifts the scene — that functions as the passage’s end point.

          Start calculation: 2687-04-23T19:00 + 21 days = 2687-05-14T19:00. Because the text provides only “three weeks” as a timing anchor, the exact clock time is not stated; I use the computed date (three weeks later) as the temporal anchor. The events described (projects, testing, a midday “break time,” and planning for “tomorrow”) all fit into a single active day of rebuilding; the passage therefore likely spans a single day of activity and ends the moment the signal is detected.

          I note there was a conflicting summary time (previous-ending-time: 2687-04-23T17:30) inside the materials, but the instruction told me to treat the PREVIOUS PASSAGE OUTLINE TIME (2687-04-23T19:00) as authoritative, so I used 19:00 as the reference point.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>2687-05-14T19:00 (three weeks after previous passage; exact time-of-day not specified—narrative implies daytime/working period)</starts>
        <ends>2687-05-14 (same day; ends at the moment the artificial/human signal is detected — evening of 2687-05-14, approx.)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>21 days (three weeks). During this gap they plausibly rebuilt and reconfigured the facility: structural repairs, new design work, acoustic/resonance chamber construction, scent/chemical experimentation, furniture/alcove growth, and social reintegration. The passage describes concentrated collaborative construction, testing, and social integration that fit that interval.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Three weeks is a reasonable and believable interval for the kinds of plant-driven reconstruction and iterative design described here—especially given the plants’ regenerative/growth capabilities and that many tasks are described as collaborative and concurrent. The pacing (a single day of active work and testing culminating in a break and planning for tomorrow, then an abrupt plot change on detection of a signal) is consistent and believable. Minor note: the exact time-of-day for the start is unspecified; I used the computed date (2687-05-14) from the three-week anchor and treated the events as occurring over one workday leading into evening when the signal appears.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present: The narrator Kira (first-person) is present throughout. Runner appears when they "emerge from underground" (enters the scene). Velvet is present and calls from across the space. Scout "bounces over" (enters during the scene). Remedy is working in their area and converses. Holloway coordinates and moves between projects. Florence "wheels over" (enters during the scene). Buddy, Kira's AI companion, communicates mentally and is directly quoted. No character explicitly leaves the scene before it ends, so there are no exits. The passage explicitly references "Uncharted" (as a cultural/media reference), so the Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone entity is relevant. The Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet entity is not mentioned in the passage, so it is not included.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage advances the timeline three weeks: the survivors have moved from exhausted recovery into an active, collaborative rebuild where plant and human participants redesign the facility for shared life. Key new facts: Runner repurposed the underground network into acoustic/resonance chambers and transit; Velvet has regrown into structural and ergonomic fixtures (furniture, alcoves, gardens); Remedy shifted from survival chemistry to environmental/enhancement scents and compounds; Holloway coordinates without dominating; Florence participates as an equal, integrating defensive needs into the new layouts; Scout provides social glue and a curated gallery; Kira recognizes she is considered a permanent community member rather than a guest. Most importantly, Buddy detects an artificial signal (possibly human-origin) from the communication array, introducing a new plot tension (possible rescue) and changing stakes. I consolidated earlier detail about the battle’s heavy cost and individual exhaustion into a single bullet noting recovery and active contributions, since the passage shows most of those characters are now functioning and rebuilding. I kept the rescued/destruction of the command node and prior cooperation notes but removed granular descriptions of combat tactics and earlier emotional exchanges that are now background to the rebuild. The updated bullets remain chronological and focused on plot-relevant developments going forward.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Mining shuttle crashed during approach; Kira Voss survived with Buddy (AI) and Scout active; SAM remains offline.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; local plant collective sheltered Kira and used the shuttle as shelter.
          - Hostile plants coordinated assaults; defenders improvised layered defenses and chemical traps and located a large underground command node ~50 m east.
          - Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway and others executed a coordinated attack that forced the command node to surface; defenders destroyed and extracted the root mass for disposal, collapsing hostile coordination.
          - Victory came at high cost: facility damaged and supplies depleted; survivors initially injured/exhausted (Runner injured, Velvet depleted, Remedy chemically exhausted, Holloway drained) but survived; Florence began moving from isolation toward reintegration.
          - Over subsequent weeks the group shifted from survival to cooperative recovery and decision-making: Florence tentatively reintegrated; Buddy and Scout observed genuine voluntary cooperation.
          - Three weeks later the facility is being actively rebuilt by committee: plants and humans redesign spaces for shared life rather than restoring old protocols.
          - Runner repurposed the underground network for transit, communication and acoustic/resonance chambers that serve aesthetic, functional and early-warning roles.
          - Velvet regrew structural elements into purpose-built spaces (ergonomic seating, sleeping moss alcoves, curated alcoves/galleries) informed by human feedback.
          - Remedy expanded from survival chemistry to environmental enhancements (scents, aromas, comfort compounds) and experimental nonessential improvements.
          - Holloway coordinates non-authoritatively, integrating contributions and ensuring designs meet diverse needs.
          - Florence contributes defensive considerations as an equal voice and helps integrate safety into the new layouts.
          - Scout provides social support and cultural curation (gallery of collected items); communal practices and small contributions solidified genuine belonging.
          - Kira realizes she is considered a permanent resident and community member—her human perspective has been integrated into facility design and decision-making.
          - Buddy detects an artificial signal on the communication array, possibly human in origin, presenting a new plot tension (potential rescue) that immediately shifts the community’s situation and priorities.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV feeling and why:
          - Kira experiences a slow, accumulating warmth that resolves into a startling, vulnerable recognition: she belongs. The feeling comes from concrete evidence (facility redesigned with her ergonomics, people explicitly naming her value) rather than a single sentimental line. That recognition is tender and destabilizing—she's happy, astonished, and a little off-balance because belonging changes her sense of future.

          Reader experience:
          - The reader shares that warm, domestic satisfaction: relief that the fractured group produced something humane and creative rather than reverting to brittle protocols. The scene reads like a restorative lull—cozy, inventive, and emotionally rich—until the final beat. The last line (possible human signal) snaps the reader back into suspense and moral ambivalence: delight and safety versus the terrifying possibility of loss or choice.

          Multiple beats or one tone:
          - There are two dominant emotional tones in sequence: (1) a sustained, composite beat of belonging/joy/acceptance (with smaller notes of wonder, pride, and relief) and (2) a sudden spike into suspense/dread when the human signal is detected. The passage is deliberately structured as an emotional settling followed by an abrupt strategic pivot.

          Comparison with emotional pattern so far:
          - This continues the arc of repair, trust-building, and identity-shifting that has been running through the recent scenes; it provides a quieter, restorative chapter that consolidates growth (Kira's integration, Florence's partial reintegration, plant collaborators' relational shift). The ending reintroduces the higher-stakes tension typical of earlier setpieces, restoring narrative momentum.

          Surprises for the reader:
          - The only clear, genuine surprise is the signal detection at the end. Everything else—Runner's aesthetics, Velvet's human furniture, Remedy's perfumes, Holloway's enabling coordination—is developmentally believable from prior character growth; they feel like earned continuations rather than surprises.

          Character growth/revelation:
          - Several characters show continued transitions from procedure-driven roles to creative, relational contributions (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence). Kira's biggest development is internal and categorical: she moves from being a protected guest to a recognized resident whose voice shapes communal life. That shift is both identity-confirming and programmatic (she's asked for input on future builds), and it has immediate narrative consequences once the signal appears.

        <beats>
          <beat tags="acceptance, intimacy">Kira's central beat: a wrenching, tender realization that she's no longer a temporary charge but a resident whose preferences have materially shaped the rebuilt facility. The emotion is warm, slightly unsteady gratitude—she feels included and seen. The reader experiences comforting closure and emotional payoff for the trust-building arc.</beat>
          <beat tags="joy, wonder">Communal flourishing: Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Scout, Holloway and others transform survival infrastructure into artful, human-aware spaces—acoustic chambers, ergonomic furniture, scents, galleries. The mood is playful, proud, and inventive; the reader feels uplifted by domestic, creative intimacy and the sense of cooperative repair.</beat>
          <beat tags="suspense, dread">Abrupt tonal shift: Buddy detects an artificial signal—possible human origin—introducing immediate suspense and moral conflict. Kira (and the reader) move from savoring belonging to the uneasy prospect of rescue or departure. The beat converts warm contentment into high-stakes uncertainty.</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="plot, reversal">A late, decisive plot surprise: an artificial (possibly human) signal is detected after the scene of settled belonging. It reverses the sense of closure—what had become 'home' could be disrupted by rescue or contact, forcing an imminent choice and changing stakes immediately.</surprise>
        </surprises>
        <character-development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="identity-shift">Makes an internal identity shift from 'protected guest' to invested community member—recognizes her voice is embedded in the facility's rebuilt bones and emotionally commits (she doesn't want to leave). Her belonging is acknowledged publicly (asked to advise on the western wing), consolidating trust into identity.</development>
          <development character="Runner" tag="transformation">Evolves from strict subterranean engineer into a creative systems-builder—designs resonance chambers and pursues aesthetic as well as functional goals, showing comfort with experimentation and a desire to create connection through form.</development>
          <development character="Velvet" tag="skill-learned">Learns human ergonomics and translates conversational feedback into tangible, comfortable furniture and human-scale alcoves—moves from generic structural growth to tailored, empathetic design.</development>
          <development character="Remedy" tag="transformation">Shifts focus beyond survival chemistry to environmental enhancement (pleasant, human-safe scents and comfort compounds), signaling a moral/esthetic reorientation: chemistry can provide joy, not just necessity.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="relationship-shift">Continues to move from authoritative procedure to facilitative coordination—enabling heterogeneous contributions rather than controlling them, embodying a relational leadership style.</development>
          <development character="Florence" tag="trust-built">Appears reintegrated in practice: contributing on equal footing, accepting feedback, and operating as an ordinary (valuable) voice rather than an imposed authority; her redemption has become functional and social.</development>
          <development character="Buddy" tag="trust-built">Acts as emotional and interpretive mirror—calling attention to Kira's belonging and framing it as family; continues to mature by naming social reality and offering perspective rather than mere data.</development>

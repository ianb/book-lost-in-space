    Looked through the passage for voiceover adjustments. Noted the following:
    1. Staccato sentences: Several short sentences (e.g., the opening lines, some beats like "This is new.") — these were merged or linked with em dashes to flow better for speech.
    2. Dialog where the speaker is not indicated before the dialog: The final line "Are these yours?" had no clear speaker; I disambiguated it as the narrator asking Scout by adding a one-word cue "to Scout" before the quote.
    3. Ambiguous pronouns or dialog: "They" is used for Runner/Scout/Velvet as names; context kept intact but I kept speaker labels on dialog lines to avoid confusion.
    4. Places that require a pause: The opening time/location beats and the moment when the space harmonizes felt like natural pause points — merged sentences and inserted an explicit long pause marker (¶) after the description of the space singing to allow a breath.
    5. Text that is too formal or stilted: Minor smoothing to make narration natural for voice — no change to story content or meaning.
    6. Symbols / non-text elements: None needing conversion.
    Other style choices applied to match the voiceover rules:
    - Put dialog on its own line and used lead-in then quote format (e.g., Runner asks, "...").
    - Collapsed multiple beats from the same speaker into single blocks with em dashes for intra-beat pauses.
    - Converted short fragments into slightly longer spoken sentences where necessary (merging with em dashes or commas) rather than leaving lots of single short lines.
    - Added a single dramatic pause paragraph containing only "¶" where the moment called for a breath.
    No narrative content was altered beyond these voice-friendly formatting adjustments.

        Three weeks since the battle — the facility is almost unrecognizable. Not because it's wrecked — though it was, thoroughly — but because it's being rebuilt by committee: a weird, creative, enthusiastic committee of plants who apparently decided "just following the old plans" was boring.

        I'm standing in what used to be the common area, watching Runner emerge from underground with yet another adjustment to their network design.

        Runner asks — vines gesturing toward a bowl-shaped depression in the floor — "Kira, can you test the resonance chamber?"

        I ask, "The what now?"

        Runner answers — vines moving — "Stand in the center and say something. I'm trying to create acoustically interesting spaces."

        I step into the depression. I say, "Testing, testing."

        My voice echoes weirdly — not quite an echo, more like harmony. The space seems to sing along.

        ¶

        I say, "That's incredible." The space turns it into something almost musical.

        Runner's vines ripple with satisfaction.

        Runner says, "The underground network isn't just for transportation and communication anymore — I realized it could be... beautiful. Functional and aesthetic. Individual spaces with individual characteristics."

        I say, "You're creating art."

        Runner replies, "I'm creating connection. But yes, also art."

        This is new — the old Runner would have followed underground construction protocols exactly; current Runner is designing underground chambers that sing.

        Velvet's growth is everywhere — but not the standard structural reinforcement I'm used to. They've created alcoves and spaces with specific purposes: sleeping areas with soft moss, meeting spots with pleasant proportions, even something that might be a garden, though calling it a garden feels inadequate when the gardener is themselves a plant.

        Velvet calls, "Kira!"

        Velvet asks, "Does this seating arrangement feel comfortable from human perspective?"

        I go over to examine their latest creation — growth shaped into seating with back support, appropriate height, even cushioning texture.

        I say — sitting — "This is actually really comfortable" — "How did you know?"

        Velvet says, "I asked you last week about human ergonomics — you said you'd show me your crash pod seat design — I extrapolated from there and tested prototypes."

        I say, "This is amazing, Velvet."

        Velvet replies, "It's practical. But also..."

        Velvet's growth rustles. "I enjoy creating spaces that serve specific needs rather than just growing generically — everyone's voice about what they need helps me design better."

        Scout bounces over, enthusiastic as always — helping everyone, moving between projects, providing what I've come to recognize as emotional support through physical presence.

        I ask to Scout, "Scout, what have you been working on?"

        Scout leads me to a section of wall where Velvet's growth has created small alcoves at Scout-height — personal storage or collection spaces.

        I ask to Scout, "Are these yours?"

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Keep the narration light, curious, and musical — moderate tempo, with small, clear pauses so the image of singing spaces can breathe.

        - Voice quality: Use a fluting, woodwind-like tone throughout (Holloway flutes rather than speaks). Keep it consistently melodic but clear.
        - Read the opening line with a warm, observant curiosity: "Three weeks since the battle — the facility is almost unrecognizable." Pause at the em dash.
        - For Runner's lines: slightly bright, pleased curiosity. When reading "Runner asks — vines gesturing..." imagine a small smile in the voice.
        - At "Testing, testing." make the syllables slightly spaced, letting the following pause and the description of the echo land.
        - For the long pause marker (the paragraph containing only "¶"), take a full breath and hold a quiet beat before continuing into "I say, 'That's incredible.'"
        - Velvet's lines should sound careful and deliberate, curious about ergonomics; the brief rustling line "Velvet's growth rustles" is a soft textural moment — lower volume, gentle.
        - Scout moments are bouncy and lively; in the lines referencing Scout's movement, add a springiness to the phrasing without changing pitch dramatically.
        - When a dialog block contains multiple beats joined by em dashes (for the same speaker), keep the flow steady but use the em dashes as small rests — not full stops.

        Scout bounces affirmatively — each alcove contains something: interesting rocks, pretty leaves, items Scout has collected, arranged deliberately, curated.

        I say, "You made a gallery."

        Scout bounces, pleased — they've been collecting beauty and want to share it.

        I say, "I love it."

        Scout bounces pure joy.

        Remedy is in their work area, which has also been transformed. Instead of just survival compounds, they're producing enhancements: colors, scents, things that make daily life better rather than just possible.

        I ask, "Remedy, what's that smell?"

        Remedy's edges shift. Remedy replies — "Experimental aromatic compound. Does it please your human olfactory system? I'm developing environmental enhancements — the facility should be comfortable, not just functional. I used to only think about survival chemistry, but Velvet asked what I could do to make their growth smell better — Florence asked about tactical applications of scent for communication — Kira asked about human-safe fragrances. I realized chemistry can serve joy, not just necessity."

        I breathe in. "It's nice. Calming."

        I say, "You're making perfume."

        Remedy answers, "I'm making life better."

        It's the same sentiment everyone's expressing: contribution beyond protocol, individual voices creating collective improvement.

        Holloway is coordinating all of this, but not controlling. They move between projects, offering suggestions, asking questions, helping people connect their individual efforts.

        Holloway asks, "How's the eastern section coming?"

        Velvet replies, "Structural integrity complete. Now adding aesthetic elements based on Kira's feedback about human need for varied visual stimulation."

        Holloway asks, "And Runner, can your acoustic network integrate with Velvet's aesthetic planning?"

        Runner replies, "Already designing connection points. The resonance chambers will flow naturally through Velvet's spaces."

        Holloway says, "Excellent. Florence, do the defensive considerations work with these layouts?"

        Florence wheels over. Florence says, "The layout maintains defensive visibility while creating comfortable spaces — better than the old design, actually. The alcoves provide protection points without feeling like bunkers."

        Velvet adds, "Because Kira mentioned humans don't like feeling trapped."

        Runner notes, "And my acoustic chambers can serve as early warning systems."

        Remedy contributes, "And my scent markers can indicate safe zones."

        Everyone builds on each other's ideas — individual voices creating harmony.

        I'm watching this, feeling… something I didn't expect.

        Holloway asks, "Kira, can you check the sight lines from human eye level?"

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Keep the narration light, curious, and musical — moderate tempo, with clear, small pauses so the collaborative, creative scene can breathe. Holloway should have a fluting, woodwind-like quality.

        - Voice quality: Maintain a fluting, woodwind-like tone for Holloway lines; otherwise keep the narrator warm and observant.
        - Read "I say, "You made a gallery."" with gentle surprise and warmth.
        - Scout moments ("Scout bounces...", "Scout bounces pure joy") should be bouncy and lively — add a slight springiness to the phrasing.
        - For Remedy's long explanatory quote, keep a steady, thoughtful pace and use the em dashes as brief rests: read the whole block as one speaker with small pauses at each dash.
        - When reading short, functional lines like "I breathe in." or "I say, "I love it."" allow a small, natural pause afterward to let the sensory detail land.
        - For the collaborative exchange (Holloway, Velvet, Runner, Florence, Remedy), make each speaker distinct by slightly shifting timbre and pacing: Holloway flute-like and deliberate; Velvet careful and ergonomic; Runner bright and technical; Florence grounded and practical; Remedy precise and curious.
        - At "I'm watching this, feeling… something I didn't expect," slow slightly on the ellipsis so the trailing uncertainty is audible.

        I move through the space, examining how it feels from my perspective — the ceiling height is comfortable, not too high and not too low, and the pathways are wide enough without feeling overwhelming. The lighting from Holloway's bioluminescence reflects off Velvet's growth at pleasant angles.

        I report, "It feels good. Really good — like… designed for humans as much as for plants."

        Holloway says, "It's designed for all of us — this is our community space — everyone's needs matter."

        And that's when it hits me.
        ¶
        They're not designing around me as a temporary guest — they're designing for me as a permanent resident. Somewhere over the past weeks I stopped being 'Kira the human we have to protect' and became 'Kira who lives here.'

        My voice has been shaping these decisions — my feedback about human ergonomics, visual preferences, spatial needs is built into the facility's bones. Literally — Velvet's growth is the bones.

        I'm not a visitor anymore — I'm a community member.

        Scout bounces, concerned.
        "Kira? You okay?"

        I say, "Yeah… I'm just realizing something."

        Florence wheels closer.
        "What?"

        I say, "This is home."

        The facility falls quiet — everyone processes what I just said.

        Holloway's bioluminescence brightens.
        "Yes. It is."

        Velvet says, "Your voice matters here."

        Runner adds, "Just as much as ours."

        Remedy says, "You contribute uniquely."

        Florence says, "You belong."

        Scout bounces emphatically — it's been saying this all along with its bounces, glad everyone else finally made it explicit.

        I'm standing in this partially rebuilt facility that's being transformed by collective creativity, and I'm realizing that I'm not just watching the transformation — I'm part of it. My individual voice — my human perspective, my needs, my ideas — is contributing to the harmony, not in spite of being different but because being different means I bring something unique to the collective.

        Just like Runner's underground artistry — Velvet's aesthetic growth — Remedy's enhancement chemistry — Holloway's enabling coordination — Florence's tactical integration — Scout's emotional connection.

        Everyone's voice matters — including mine.

        «Buddy — you seeing this?» I think to my AI companion.

        Buddy says, "Yes, Kira! This is fascinating! Do you realize what just happened — they all said you belong, not as a guest or obligation — as family."

        I admit, "I didn't expect to belong with bureaucratic alien plants."

        Buddy asks, "Why not?"

        Buddy continues, "You've been contributing since you arrived — your questions shaped how they think about beauty, comfort, individual voices — maybe belonging isn't about what you expected — maybe it's about what you built."

        I think about that. In Uncharted, found families always form through dramatic crisis moments — Mav saving someone's life, shared enemies, that kind of thing. But this… this grew slowly, through questions and conversations and small contributions that accumulated into something real.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, reflective, and quietly surprised — moderate tempo with clear small pauses so the realization and community responses can breathe. Holloway should sound fluting and musical; the narrator remains observant and intimate.

        - Read "And that's when it hits me." and immediately hold a long beat — insert the dramatic pause represented by the lone paragraph mark "¶".
        - For "I report, "It feels good..."" be light and curious, with a trailing hesitation on "Like… designed".
        - When reading Holloway lines such as "Holloway says, "It's designed for all of us…"" use a fluting, woodwind-like quality — deliberate and gentle.
        - Make the short communal replies distinct: slightly brighter for Runner ("Just as much as ours."), careful and ergonomic for Velvet ("Your voice matters here."), precise and calm for Remedy ("You contribute uniquely."), grounded for Florence ("You belong."), and bouncy, springy energy for Scout's bounces.
        - For internal thought text like "«Buddy — you seeing this?» I think..." keep it quieter and more intimate than spoken dialog so it reads as a private thought.
        - Deliver Buddy's lines with genuine awe and upbeat pacing — treat its longer block as one speaker with small rests at the em dashes.
        - On the closing reflection about found families, slow slightly on the ellipsis in "But this… this grew slowly" to let the contrast register.

        I say, "That's actually better, isn't it?"
        Buddy asks, "What do you mean?"
        I say, "Better than TV — real belonging instead of dramatic bonding."

        Buddy says, "TV can't show the quiet parts — but the quiet parts are where trust actually grows."
        ¶
        Buddy says, "Kira? I used to think I wasn't designed for any of this — remember when I kept trying to name things and suggest games — when I didn't know what to do so I just… defaulted to field trip mode?"
        I say, "I remember."
        Buddy says, "But maybe learning alongside you was exactly what was needed — maybe asking questions instead of having answers was the right approach all along."

        Something warm spreads through my chest — Buddy's growing too; we both are.

        Holloway announces, "Break time — everyone's been working hard. Per Section eight point three, mandatory rest periods improve productivity by twenty-three percent."
        I say, "Did you just make up that statistic?"
        Holloway says, "I made up Section eight point three — the statistic is real — I've been tracking."

        Runner's vines ripple with what might be laughter. Runner says, "Holloway, when did you get funny?"
        Holloway says, "I've always been funny — you just weren't documenting it properly."

        The community settles into various comfortable positions. Velvet's seating arrangements get tested — everyone trying them out, adjusting, suggesting modifications.

        Runner demonstrates the acoustic chambers — different spaces creating different harmonics. It's weird and wonderful, hearing plant voices resonate through intentionally designed architecture.

        Remedy shares experimental scents — some pleasant, some strange, and one that makes everyone immediately request they never produce it again. Absurdist comedy in plant perfume testing.

        Holloway announces, "Callback to the water filter incident — still funny."
        Everyone pauses.
        Runner makes a sound that might be laughter. Runner asks, "Holloway, are you making jokes now?"
        Holloway says, "I'm noting observations relevant to community morale."

        Scout bounces between everyone — spreading social glue, making sure nobody's isolated.

        Florence participates equally — offering suggestions, accepting feedback, contributing without dominating — her redemption arc complete. She's not just valued despite past mistakes; she's integral to community function.

        And I'm here too — contributing, belonging.

        The facility is taking shape as something new — not the restoration of old protocols but the creation of new harmony — individual voices working together.
        ¶
        And somewhere in the past weeks, without quite noticing when, I found my voice in this chorus.

        Holloway says, "Tomorrow we start on the western wing — thoughts on design approach?"
        Everyone starts contributing ideas — Runner's acoustic considerations, Velvet's aesthetic planning, Remedy's environmental enhancements, Florence's defensive integration.

        They all turn to me. They ask, "Kira, what do humans need in western wing spaces?"

        _My voice._ They're asking for my voice — not as a guest, but *as a community member.*
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, reflective, quietly surprised — steady pace with clear medium pauses and a couple of long beats so realizations can land. Holloway should be musical and flute-like; Buddy gentle and thoughtful; Runner bright and slightly higher in pitch; the narrator intimate and observant.

        - Read "I say, "That's actually better, isn't it?"" as light curiosity — then shift to gentle wonder for the following lines.
        - For the block starting "Buddy says, "TV can't show the quiet parts..."" deliver Buddy as thoughtful and slightly awed — treat the entire multi-sentence block as one speaker with small internal rests (use the em dashes as medium pauses).
        - Where the text contains the single-line paragraph "¶" hold a long, reflective beat (dramatic pause) before continuing.
        - Read Holloway lines as fluting, musical, and serene — for example, when reading "Holloway announces, "Break time..."" use a warm, slightly playful woodwind tone. (This replaces the inline adverbs; do not vocalize adverbs like "serenely".)
        - Runner's vocal parts (and the descriptions like "Runner's vines ripple") should be brighter and a little mischievous — make the laugh-like sounds quick and buoyant.
        - For short, reflective narrator lines like "And I'm here too — contributing, belonging" keep the delivery intimate, softer, and slightly slower so the sense of belonging lands.
        - Emphasize the final lines: on "_My voice._" read quieter and intimate; on "*as a community member.*" increase volume and conviction — this is the narrator's quiet realization turned firm statement.

        I share my thoughts — human need for windows even if we're underground, maybe Velvet's translucent growth; temperature regulation, perhaps Remedy's compounds; comfortable sleeping arrangements, Velvet's ergonomic designs.

        Everyone listens, integrates my input, builds on my suggestions.

        This is what harmony sounds like — not everyone singing the same note, everyone singing their own note, creating something richer together.

        Scout bounces contentedly against my leg — they knew, they always knew I belonged here.

        The community settles into comfortable silence, exhausted from rebuilding, satisfied with progress, at peace with each other.

        I look around at these weird, wonderful plant people who somehow created space for a random human to find home.

        And I realize something that should probably be obvious.

        ¶

        I don't want to leave.

        This accidental community of bureaucratic aliens has become more home than anywhere I've been in years — maybe ever.

        But even as I'm realizing this, Buddy chimes in my mind —
        "Kira! I'm detecting something unusual in the communication array! — Signal. Definitely artificial. Possibly human origin. Should I investigate?"

        Everyone's looking at me — they heard my side of the conversation, wondering what Buddy's saying.

        I tell them —
        "Possible signal. Maybe human."

        The atmosphere shifts immediately.

        Human signal.

        Possible rescue.

        Everything just changed.

        Again.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm and reflective at first, intimate and steady; shift to alertness and quiet urgency when Buddy speaks — keep medium pauses for beats and one long pause before the narrator's realization.

        - Read "I share my thoughts — human need for windows..." as conversational and curious, slightly faster than the reflective lines that follow.
        - Emphasize the line break before "This is what harmony sounds like" to let the image land — then flow into the following em-dash clause.
        - For "Scout bounces contentedly against my leg — they knew..." be tender and affectionate.
        - Hold a long, reflective beat on the single-line paragraph "¶" before delivering "I don't want to leave." — let the realization land.
        - Deliver Buddy's block (beginning with "Kira! I'm detecting...") as one speaker in the narrator's head — slightly abrupt, alert, with small internal rests at each em dash.
        - Read the narrator's reply ("Possible signal. Maybe human.") quieter at first, then let the words raise the room's attention.
        - For the short lines "Human signal." and "Possible rescue." treat each as a sharp, low-emphasis announcement — brief, measured.
        - Closing cadence: Plain closing cadence; clean fall, short pause.

  <title>Individual Harmony</title>
  <combined-text>
    Three weeks since the battle — the facility is almost unrecognizable. Not because it's wrecked — though it was, thoroughly — but because it's being rebuilt by committee: a weird, creative, enthusiastic committee of plants who apparently decided "just following the old plans" was boring.

    I'm standing in what used to be the common area, watching Runner emerge from underground with yet another adjustment to their network design.

    Runner asks — vines gesturing toward a bowl-shaped depression in the floor — "Kira, can you test the resonance chamber?"

    I ask, "The what now?"

    Runner answers — vines moving — "Stand in the center and say something. I'm trying to create acoustically interesting spaces."

    I step into the depression. I say, "Testing, testing."

    My voice echoes weirdly — not quite an echo, more like harmony. The space seems to sing along.

    I say, "That's incredible." The space turns it into something almost musical.

    Runner's vines ripple with satisfaction.

    Runner says, "The underground network isn't just for transportation and communication anymore — I realized it could be... beautiful. Functional and aesthetic. Individual spaces with individual characteristics."

    I say, "You're creating art."

    Scout leads me to a section of wall where Velvet's growth has created small alcoves at Scout-height — personal storage or collection spaces.

    I ask to Scout, "Are these yours?"

    Scout bounces affirmatively — each alcove contains something: interesting rocks, pretty leaves, items Scout has collected, arranged deliberately, curated.

    I say, "Yeah… I'm just realizing something."

    Florence wheels closer.
    "What?"

    I say, "This is home."

    The facility falls quiet — everyone processes what I just said.

    Holloway's bioluminescence brightens.
    "Yes. It is."

    Velvet says, "Your voice matters here."

    Runner adds, "Just as much as ours."

    Remedy says, "You contribute uniquely."

    Florence says, "You belong."

    Scout bounces emphatically — it's been saying this all along with its bounces, glad everyone else finally made it explicit.

    I'm standing in this partially rebuilt facility that's being transformed by collective creativity, and I'm realizing that I'm not just watching the transformation — I'm part of it. My individual voice — my human perspective, my needs, my ideas — is contributing to the harmony, not in spite of being different but because being different means I bring something unique to the collective.

    Just like Runner's underground artistry — Velvet's aesthetic growth — Remedy's enhancement chemistry — Holloway's enabling coordination — Florence's tactical integration — Scout's emotional connection.

    Everyone's voice matters — including mine.

    «Buddy — you seeing this?» I think to my AI companion.

    Buddy says, "Yes, Kira! This is fascinating! Do you realize what just happened — they all said you belong, not as a guest or obligation — as family."

    I admit, "I didn't expect to belong with bureaucratic alien plants."

    Buddy asks, "Why not?"

    Buddy continues, "You've been contributing since you arrived — your questions shaped how they think about beauty, comfort, individual voices — maybe belonging isn't about what you expected — maybe it's about what you built."

    I think about that. In Uncharted, found families always form through dramatic crisis moments — Mav saving someone's life, shared enemies, that kind of thing. But this… this grew slowly, through questions and conversations and small contributions that accumulated into something real.

    I say, "That's actually better, isn't it?"
    Buddy asks, "What do you mean?"
    I say, "Better than TV — real belonging instead of dramatic bonding."

    Buddy says, "TV can't show the quiet parts — but the quiet parts are where trust actually grows."

    Buddy says, "Kira? I used to think I wasn't designed for any of this — remember when I kept trying to name things and suggest games — when I didn't know what to do so I just… defaulted to field trip mode?"
    I say, "I remember."
    Buddy says, "But maybe learning alongside you was exactly what was needed — maybe asking questions instead of having answers was the right approach all along."

    Something warm spreads through my chest — Buddy's growing too; we both are.

    Holloway announces, "Break time — everyone's been working hard. Per Section eight point three, mandatory rest periods improve productivity by twenty-three percent."
    I say, "Did you just make up that statistic?"
    Holloway says, "I made up Section eight point three — the statistic is real — I've been tracking."

    Runner's vines ripple with what might be laughter. Runner says, "Holloway, when did you get funny?"
    Holloway says, "I've always been funny — you just weren't documenting it properly."

    The community settles into various comfortable positions. Velvet's seating arrangements get tested — everyone trying them out, adjusting, suggesting modifications.

    Runner demonstrates the acoustic chambers — different spaces creating different harmonics. It's weird and wonderful, hearing plant voices resonate through intentionally designed architecture.

    Remedy shares experimental scents — some pleasant, some strange, and one that makes everyone immediately request they never produce it again. Absurdist comedy in plant perfume testing.

    Holloway announces, "Callback to the water filter incident — still funny."
    Everyone pauses.
    Runner makes a sound that might be laughter. Runner asks, "Holloway, are you making jokes now?"
    Holloway says, "I'm noting observations relevant to community morale."

    Scout bounces between everyone — spreading social glue, making sure nobody's isolated.

    Florence participates equally — offering suggestions, accepting feedback, contributing without dominating — her redemption arc complete. She's not just valued despite past mistakes; she's integral to community function.

    And I'm here too — contributing, belonging.

    The facility is taking shape as something new — not the restoration of old protocols but the creation of new harmony — individual voices working together.

    And somewhere in the past weeks, without quite noticing when, I found my voice in this chorus.

    Holloway says, "Tomorrow we start on the western wing — thoughts on design approach?"
    Everyone starts contributing ideas — Runner's acoustic considerations, Velvet's aesthetic planning, Remedy's environmental enhancements, Florence's defensive integration.

    They all turn to me. They ask, "Kira, what do humans need in western wing spaces?"

    _My voice._ They're asking for my voice — not as a guest, but *as a community member.*

    I share my thoughts — human need for windows even if we're underground, maybe Velvet's translucent growth; temperature regulation, perhaps Remedy's compounds; comfortable sleeping arrangements, Velvet's ergonomic designs.

    Everyone listens, integrates my input, builds on my suggestions.

    This is what harmony sounds like — not everyone singing the same note, everyone singing their own note, creating something richer together.

    Scout bounces contentedly against my leg — they knew, they always knew I belonged here.

    The community settles into comfortable silence, exhausted from rebuilding, satisfied with progress, at peace with each other.

    I look around at these weird, wonderful plant people who somehow created space for a random human to find home.

    And I realize something that should probably be obvious.

    I don't want to leave.

    This accidental community of bureaucratic aliens has become more home than anywhere I've been in years — maybe ever.

    But even as I'm realizing this, Buddy chimes in my mind —
    "Kira! I'm detecting something unusual in the communication array! — Signal. Definitely artificial. Possibly human origin. Should I investigate?"

    Everyone's looking at me — they heard my side of the conversation, wondering what Buddy's saying.

    I tell them —
    "Possible signal. Maybe human."

    The atmosphere shifts immediately.

    Human signal.

    Possible rescue.

    Everything just changed.

    Again.

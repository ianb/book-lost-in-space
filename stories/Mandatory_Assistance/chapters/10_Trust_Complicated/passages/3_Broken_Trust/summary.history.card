      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          This passage continues the aftermath of Florence's exposure and shows the group trying to convert conflict into action while still fractured. Several previously-open operational promises are advanced into concrete decisions (delegation chosen, immediate response plan set, Florence separated/exiled and stripped of privileges, the group's informal choice to use Florence's tactics without credit). Many broader survival, investigation, AI, and environmental threads were not addressed and remain open. No previous open promise was explicitly abandoned as moot; most continue to matter.

          Fulfilled items are those explicit outcomes or decisions that were raised as open in the prior passage and are now enacted in this scene (exile/separation enacted, delegation scheduled, immediate response plan decided, decision to use Florence's plan despite breach). Remaining open promises are carried forward unchanged where the passage did not resolve them, or where only partial progress was made (e.g., Florence separated but her long-term status / restitution timeline is still unresolved). New promises introduced are mostly operational and interpersonal: an actual dawn delegation is set, the hostile plants have escalated their territorial markings significantly, Kira is explicitly excluded from the field delegation, Florence intends to continue offering advice from exile, and there's an emergent risk that the group will apply Florence's tactics anonymously/hypocritically, complicating trust rebuilding.
        </reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_DIPLOMACY_PLAN">A delegation to present non-threatening intentions and attempt de-escalation was planned; the group has now scheduled Runner and Velvet to approach the hostile plants at dawn.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMEDIATE_RESPONSE_PLAN_TO_HOSTILE_PLANTS">An immediate acceptable plan for dealing with the territorial markers was required; the group has chosen to send a dawn delegation (Runner and Velvet) to deliver a message of peaceful coexistence and invite dialogue.</promise>
          <promise id="DECISION_ON_USING_FLORENCE_ADVICE_DESPITE_BREACH">Whether to follow Florence's de-escalation/boundary advice despite her breach was unsettled; the group chooses (implicitly) to adopt the de-escalation approach while refusing to credit Florence.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_AND_SEPARATION">Florence was asked to separate and use other chambers; the passage shows her isolated in a sparse chamber, confirming the immediate exile/separation has been enacted.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PRIVILEGE_REVOKED_AND_CONSEQUENCES">Florence's interpretive privilege was revoked and consequences were unresolved; the passage shows she is removed from group decision-making and using separate quarters, so the privilege revocation is now in effect.</promise>

          <promise id="REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATE_COMMUNICATIONS">Distress beacon and ship transmitters remain damaged; repairs or improvisation to contact off‑world are outstanding.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_RATIONING_AND_FORAGING">How to safely forage or source varied food beyond provisioning remains an open question.</promise>
          <promise id="WATER_QUALITY_TEST_NEEDED">Although a filter clog was cleared, formal water‑quality testing for potability and alien contaminants is still required.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_ADAPTABILITY_AND_AUTHORIZATION">Whether Buddy can adapt modes, escalate privileges, or access more systems remains unresolved.</promise>

          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The facility's presentation ritual and bureaucratic protocols remain a shaping factor for future access and expectation (ceremony reinforced, but usefulness questioned).</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_INTRODUCED">Florence's role, honesty, influence, and future status remain an active thread; she is currently exiled and her reintegration is unresolved.</promise>

          <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_FIRST_HUMAN_ADAPTATION_RISK">Novel plant actors' adaptation to humans remains a potential source of miscommunication; hostile marking shows plant politics matter.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_MINIMAL_BELONGINGS_RISK">Kira's reliance on territorial provisioning and lack of personal supplies remains a vulnerability.</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">Whether the forest behaves as a distributed organism with political/resource consequences remains central and unresolved (hostile marking is direct evidence of network politics).</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_TRUST_COMPLACENCY_RISK">Kira's growing trust in plant authorities is being recalibrated; Florence's deception concretely shifts the risk to interpersonal trust.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_WAIT_IMPACTS_SURVIVAL">The narrative tension that Elder deliberation may take long and impact survival remains relevant.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_ANSWER_WILL_HAVE_NETWORK_EFFECTS">Whether Elder's frameworks will propagate through territories and produce useful, coordinated practices remains unresolved.</promise>

          <promise id="INVENTORY_TRACKING_AND_ROTATING_STOCK">Holloway's inventory and rotating stock proposal remains an actionable supply‑management plan to implement next.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">The group committed to continuing daily cooperation—track what works, adjust what doesn't—an ongoing iterative practice that will guide immediate care decisions.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_FORMULATION_ITERATION">Remedy will continue refining treatments based on Kira's feedback.</promise>

          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">The full scope/timeline of Florence's fabrications and which Elder Twist communications are genuine remains to be investigated.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_COMMUNICATION_TIMING">Elder Twist's slow, fragmentary responses and how/when useful counsel can be solicited remain uncertain.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">The internal fracture reduces the group's cohesion and capacity to respond to the external threat; scale and duration remain open risks.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">The hostile plants' specific goals, thresholds for negotiation, and willingness to escalate to physical displacement remain unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">How fractured trust and Florence's removal will concretely impair (or be managed in) the group's defensive operations remains an immediate operational risk.</promise>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">A process, timeline, or conditions under which Florence (or others) can regain trust and what institutional changes are required remains undecided.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence's emotional/identity trajectory—whether she seeks redemption, reintegration, or marginalized existence—remains an interpersonal plotline to watch.</promise>
          <promise id="DAWN_DELEGATION_TO_HOSTILES">Newly introduced: Runner and Velvet are scheduled to approach the hostile plants at dawn to deliver a message of peaceful coexistence and invite dialogue (operational commitment).</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM">Newly introduced/confirmed: The eastern neighbors have amplified territorial markings—deeper, fresher, coordinated claims that indicate escalation toward enforced boundary control.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_EXCLUDED_FROM_DELEGATION">Newly introduced: The group decided Kira should not attend the delegation for safety/political optics, creating a potential emotional and tactical consequence to monitor.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_OFFER_ADVICE_FROM_EXILE">Newly introduced: Florence intends to continue offering her tactical judgment (e.g., insisting de-escalation is correct) even while exiled, and will attempt to communicate it informally.</promise>
          <promise id="USE_ADVICE_ANONYMIZED_RISK">Newly introduced: The group plans to apply Florence's de-escalation strategy while withholding attribution—this anonymous use may complicate trust and reconciliation later.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I identified new, longer-term facts from the passage that affect character states, group decisions, or the hostile-plant situation going forward (Florence’s present condition and desires, who will act as the delegation, escalation of boundary markings, Kira’s personal visit). I flagged one genuine contradiction: an earlier established behavioral shift (Holloway’s wellness checks became consultative) is now described as being conducted 'mechanically,' which conflicts with that previous steady-state. Other details (mood shifts, people acting perfunctorily, Florence separated) are developments consistent with previously established facts and were recorded only when they represent a durable state change or an actionable decision that will matter later (e.g., assignment of Runner &amp; Velvet to approach hostiles, Kira excluded from delegation). I did not record transient scene details (specific dialogue lines, time-of-day, or immediate emotional beats that don’t alter long-term state), and I avoided duplicating facts already captured in the provided summary.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_MECHANICAL">Holloway's morning wellness checks are being performed mechanically (reverting from the earlier consultative approach).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_QUIETER_THAN_USUAL">Runner is quieter than usual while still helping with maintenance—reduced vocal engagement during the group's current stress.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_QUIET_TREATMENT_MODE">Remedy is providing medical treatments without its usual commentary or elaboration (more restrained/brief behavior).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_BRIEF_LITERAL_OBSERVATIONS">Velvet's observations and remarks are brief and literal, showing reduced depth of engagement compared with prior behavior.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_UNAFFECTED_BY_GROUP_MORALE">Scout appears largely unaffected by the group's fractured morale—continues loyal behaviors (bouncing to Florence's usual spot) and shows confusion at Florence's absence rather than distress.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_ISOLATED_SPARSE_CHAMBER">Florence is occupying a small, sparse chamber in the far wing (wheeled platform near the wall, few personal supplies, environment that looks diminished rather than like home).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SEEKING_FORGIVENESS_AND_USEFULNESS">Florence expresses that she wants to be useful, to matter, and to be forgiven for her deception—she acknowledges being 'dishonored' and hopes for eventual reintegration.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_VISITED_FLORENCE">Kira personally visited Florence in her isolated chamber and held a private conversation attempting to mediate and offer perspective.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DELEGATION_RUNNER_VELVET_ASSIGNED">The group decided Runner and Velvet will form a peaceful delegation to approach the hostile plants at dawn to deliver a message of peaceful coexistence and invite dialogue.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_EXCLUDED_FROM_DELEGATION">Kira will not join the delegation because the group believes the hostile plants might react badly to her presence; she is to remain at the facility during the approach.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_MARKINGS_ESCALATED">Boundary markers have escalated: dozens of new, deeper, fresh territorial gouges/markings appeared on the eastern boundary, indicating an organized escalation and claiming behavior by hostile plants.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts>
          <conflict id="HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONFLICT" with-fact="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONSULTATIVE">Previously-established fact: Holloway's morning wellness checks had shifted to a consultative approach (CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONSULTATIVE). This passage describes Holloway conducting the wellness check 'mechanically,' indicating a reversion to procedural/mechanical behavior rather than consultative interaction. That is a direct contradiction to the earlier steady-state and should be resolved (either as a new state change or a scene-specific regression).</conflict>
        </conflicts>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens with “The next morning,” immediately establishing it picks up the day after the previous passage. Morning activities (wellness check, breakfast) follow, then a same-day visit to Florence, a later patrol report (Scout returning from perimeter), a group planning session, and the narrator ending with “That night, I can't sleep.” These markers show the passage spans from morning through that same evening/night. The previous passage ended around midnight (~00:00) with people dispersing and poor sleep; so the gap is the intervening night. The timeline within the passage (breakfast, a conversation visit, a patrol out-and-back, planning and then night) is consistent for a single daytime period. Minor note: while the narrator says “Scout hasn't patrolled today yet” during the Florence visit and shortly after Scout arrives back from patrol, that implies Scout left for and returned from a fairly short patrol between the visit and the later check-in — plausible for a quick perimeter round. The plan to send a delegation “tomorrow at dawn” fits with the passage ending that night.</reasoning>
        <starts>morning (~08:00)</starts>
        <ends>night (~23:00)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>About one night: ~8 hours (overnight) from the previous passage's ~00:00 to the next morning. During that gap characters slept fitfully, then resumed morning routines.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence (morning wellness checks, breakfast, a same-day visit to Florence, a patrol that returns with an escalation report, same-day planning, and the narrator lying awake at night) fits comfortably into a single daytime cycle. The only small timing pressure is Scout completing a perimeter round between the Florence visit and the later group meeting, but a brief patrol and report in that interval is realistic. Overall the timing is coherent and believable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed every named character who appears or is referred to in the passage. Present: Kira (narrator) is present throughout; Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, and Scout are present at the start and throughout; Florence appears when Kira visits her chamber; Elder Heartwood is mentioned by name (referenced). Entered: Florence was not in the opening common-area scene and appears later when Kira visits her chamber. Exited: No character who was present at the start leaves and is absent by the end of the passage, so the exited list is empty. No explicit location/organization from the provided entity list is named in the passage, so entities is empty.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage shows the group's fracture persisting into the next morning, Kira visiting Florence in isolation, and Florence admitting motives and reaffirming the de‑escalation plan. The group debates whether to use Florence's tactics despite broken trust. Scout reports a sharp escalation of territorial markings on the eastern boundary, prompting an urgent decision: Runner and Velvet will approach the hostile plants tomorrow at dawn as a peaceful delegation while Kira stays behind; Florence remains separated. I consolidated earlier procedural/details (wellness checks, small behavioral notes) into the larger trust-fracture point and kept plot-relevant facts (visit, Florence's stance, plants' escalation, delegation decision, Florence's status) while removing extra atmospheric detail.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded to Kira as perimeter scout; Kira trained at the Elder Heartwood then returned and recovered at Holloway.
          - The group shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to trust their own experiential framework rather than defer to distant authority.
          - Scout discovered deliberate, aggressive territorial markers around Holloway's eastern boundary—relocation would jeopardize Kira's survival.
          - Florence had been attributing recent counsel to Elder Twist; at an assembly she admitted fabricating most of Elder Twist's pronouncements and resigned to separate from the main group to give everyone space.
          - The admission fractured trust in Holloway: members acknowledged Florence's advice could be useful but felt manipulated and could not accept her attribution; Florence was asked to take a chamber in the far wing and is currently separated/taking space.
          - The morning after, the group remains fractured and performs cooperation without genuine trust; Scout is least affected and keeps seeking Florence.
          - Kira visits Florence in isolation; Florence says she fabricated elder attribution to get her tactical ideas heard, expresses regret and desire to be useful and forgiven, and insists her de‑escalation strategy (clear boundaries, peaceful delegation, demonstration of non‑threat) is still sound.
          - Group debates whether to use Florence's tactics despite broken trust; several members argue attribution and honesty matter while others point out the tactics worked.
          - Scout reports a sharp escalation: dozens of fresh, organized territorial markings along the eastern boundary indicating coordinated, claiming behavior by hostile plants.
          - Holloway decides Runner and Velvet will approach the hostile plants at dawn as a peaceful delegation to deliver a coexistence message; Kira will remain at Holloway for safety; Florence is not participating in group decisions while separated.
          - The collective is now under increased time pressure and weakened by internal distrust despite having access to effective tactical ideas—trust, not capability, is the critical vulnerability going forward.

      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV feelings: Kira is conflicted, tender, and restless. She feels sympathy and guilt toward Florence (wanting to repair a broken bond), plus anger/frustration at the group's refusal to credit useful counsel. When the boundary escalation is discovered, Kira's private sorrow snaps into urgent fear — she recognizes the practical cost of broken trust. Reader experience: sympathy for Florence and Kira; moral ambivalence about Florence's deception; rising irritation at the group's hypocrisy; then sudden suspense and anxiety as the external threat materializes. There are multiple emotional beats: a close, intimate sadness/belonging beat (Kira visiting Florence), a policy/moral conflict beat (debate over trust vs. utility), and an escalation beat (hostile-plant markings → urgent danger). These reuse the story's existing motifs (betrayal, grief, frustration, dread): the betrayal motif recurs but is deepened here — it's no longer only moral hurt but a practical vulnerability that heightens danger. So while the betrayal/authority theme is repetitive across the story, this passage ties that repetition to real stakes, making it feel escalatory rather than redundant.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="grief, belonging">POV: Quiet, tender sorrow and a desire to repair — Kira seeks out Florence, sees her diminished and isolated, and feels both sympathy and a responsibility to acknowledge her worth. The scene is intimate and plaintive: Kira wants to restore belonging even if it can't happen immediately. Reader: Feels sympathetic, emotionally softened toward Florence, and aware of the fragile bonds that have been broken.</beat>
          <beat tags="betrayal, frustration">POV: Moral frustration and righteous anger as Kira confronts the group about whether good advice should be discarded because of its deceptive packaging; she is exasperated by their refusal to credit Florence and by the hypocrisy of punishing usefulness. Reader: Experiences moral ambivalence—understanding Florence's motives but also understanding the group's sense of violation—resulting in irritation and ethical unease.</beat>
          <beat tags="dread, tension">POV: Sudden, practical alarm when Scout reports the hostile plants' escalated, coordinated boundary markings; Kira's worry shifts from interpersonal repair to immediate survival anxiety, knowing the group's fracture weakens their response. Reader: Feels a spike of suspense and apprehension; the emotional tempo accelerates from reflective sorrow to urgent threat, underscoring the cost of broken trust.</beat>

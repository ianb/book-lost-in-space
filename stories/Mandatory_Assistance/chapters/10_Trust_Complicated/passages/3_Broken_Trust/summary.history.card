        <reasoning>
          This passage continues the immediate fallout from Florence's revealed deception and brings the external hostile-plant threat back into sharp focus. The meeting's paralysis from the previous passage shifts into a concrete decision to send a delegation (Runner and Velvet) at dawn — i.e., the group moves from indecision to scheduling action. That decision directly resolves one pending tactical question (whether Florence's de-escalation approach will be used) while leaving the larger social and trust-based plotlines open and intensified. New, short-term promises arise from Kira's shifted affiliation (she explicitly claims she is part of the group now) and from Florence's verbal intent to still communicate her proposals to the hostile plants (even if the group may ignore her). The passage also escalates the hostile-plant threat (more and deeper territorial markers) which amplifies prior promises about hostile plants exploiting fractures and about possible forced evacuation. Many older technical/macro-mission promises are untouched by this scene and therefore remain relevant offstage, but this passage primarily advances/clarifies the social-trust and hostile-plant arcs.

          Fulfillments in this passage are concrete: the group explicitly adopts Florence's de-escalation approach as their tactical plan (even if they won't credit her), and the delegation-to-de-escalate intention is formalized/scheduled. The main lapsed item is the earlier tentative promise that the group would simply continue to delay action — the group has now set a date to act, so that speculative, ongoing delay is no longer the live state. Remaining open promises include both previously established survival/mission constraints and the social/character arcs made urgent by Florence's exile and the hostile-plant escalation.

        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="WILL_USE_FLORENCE_ADVICE">Whether the group would adopt Florence's previously-fabricated advice (de-escalation/clear boundaries) despite distrust. In this passage the group decides to send a delegation that will pursue the de-escalation approach Florence advocated.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_DEESCALATION_PLAN">The group's intention to send a delegation (Runner, Kira volunteer, possibly others) to communicate peaceful intentions and attempt de-escalation. In this passage the plan is formalized: Runner and Velvet will approach at dawn.</promise>

        <lapsed>
          <promise id="GROUP_DELAYED_RESPONSE_TO_HOSTILE_PLANTS">The tentative prediction that the group would fail to make a decisive plan and postpone action, risking that delay.

          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS" tentative="false" introduced="29">Territorial gouges and markers around the eastern perimeter indicating organized hostile plant groups. The passage shows a clear escalation in number and depth of markings—still unresolved and tactically urgent.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_EXPLOIT_INTERNAL_DIVISION" tentative="true" introduced="30">The risk that hostile plants will notice or exploit the group's internal fracture and accelerate pressure or attack. The passage makes that risk explicit and more likely as the group is fractured while markers escalate.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MAY_FORCE_EVACUATION" tentative="true" introduced="29">If hostile plants present their claim as a collective safety concern they could force relocation from the facility. The plant escalation increases the plausibility and urgency of this possibility.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_OR_SEPARATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Florence's separation from the group: she is occupying a separate chamber, excluded from decision-making. This state is active and directly shapes group dynamics and tactical choices.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_REBUILDING" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's arc of confronting the fallout of her deception and attempting to rebuild trust or find a new role. The passage deepens this arc—she is isolated and wants to be useful again but faces ongoing rejection.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_CRISIS" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's crisis about what she is without the elder's authority—who she becomes and whether she can belong. The scene reinforces and continues this tentative character arc.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_EACH_OTHER_OVER_ELDER" tentative="false" introduced="28">The group's commitment/conflict about trusting shared experience and internal judgment rather than deferring to elder authority. The promise remains live but is under severe stress after the betrayal.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_COOPERATION_TRACK_ADAPT" tentative="false" introduced="28">The group's stated ongoing commitment to track what works, adjust, and build an experience-based framework for cooperation. The ritual remains intended but strained by the breach in trust.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANTS_MAY_MISINTERPRET_HUMAN_CUSTOMS" tentative="true" introduced="26">The risk that plants still misinterpret human customs or intentions, complicating interactions. With the hostile-plant escalation and cross-species misunderstandings in play, this remains relevant.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_SCHEDULED_DAWN" tentative="false" introduced="31">Concrete short-term commitment: Runner and Velvet will approach the hostile plants at dawn to deliver a peaceful, boundary-focused message. This is the operationalization of the delegation plan and is scheduled but not yet executed.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_INTEGRATION_TO_GROUP" tentative="false" introduced="31">Kira's newly-stated shift from 'visitor' to invested community member (she explicitly declares 'I'm not' just visiting). This personal commitment can change Kira's decisions and alliances going forward.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_ATTEMPT_TO_COMMUNICATE" tentative="true" introduced="31">Florence states she will still tell the hostile plants about de-escalation and clear-boundary tactics 'anyway'—an expressed intent that may create future tension if she acts independently or is rebuffed.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I selected facts that change ongoing social dynamics, threat status, or planned actions that will matter in later scenes: Florence's emotional/isolation state and desire for reintegration; Kira's vocal defense and explicit declaration of the facility as her home (a shift in allegiance/role); the concrete delegation assignment (Runner and Velvet to approach hostile plants at dawn) and Kira's exclusion from that delegation; the visible escalation in hostile-plant territorial markings (from warnings to active claiming); and the group's decision to adopt Florence's de-escalation strategy while refusing to credit or re-include her. These items affect future trust, who speaks for the facility, tactical responses to the threat, and interpersonal conflict. I did not record transient details (who sat where, momentary emotions beyond their long-term effect) or restate facts already established in the prior list. I found no contradictions with the previously established facts—this passage continues or refines earlier developments (e.g., Florence's separation, the internal trust fracture) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SEEKING_REINTEGRATION_AND_FORGIVENESS">Florence is isolated in a sparsely furnished chamber, expresses regret for fabricating elder attribution, wants to be useful and forgiven, and hopes to be reintegrated into the collective.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_DEFENDS_FLORENCE_AND_ASSERTS_FACILITY_AS_HOME">Kira publicly defends Florence, challenges the group's refusal to trust her, and declares that the plant facility is her home and that she will not quietly accept Florence's exile.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DELEGATION_ASSIGNED_RUNNER_AND_VELVET">The collective decides to send Runner and Velvet as a peaceful delegation to approach the hostile plants at dawn; Kira is explicitly asked to remain behind for safety.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ESCALATION">Boundary markers have significantly increased and deepened: dozens of fresh, aggressive territorial markings indicate the hostile-plant faction is escalating from warnings to active claiming and is organized/coordinated.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_ADOPTS_DEESCALATION_STRATEGY_BUT_REFUSES_TO_CREDIT_FLORENCE">The group chooses to implement the de-escalation/clear-boundary/peaceful-delegation approach Florence advocated, but intends to do so while distancing from or withholding trust/credit from Florence (she remains excluded from decision-making).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_SEEKS_FLORENCE_AND_REMains_LOYAL">Scout continues to show attachment to Florence—bouncing to her usual spot, confused and unsettled by her absence—and remains emotionally loyal despite Florence's isolation.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens with “The next morning,” and describes breakfast, a morning visit to Florence, a patrol by Scout that returns with escalated boundary markings, and a decision to send a delegation “tomorrow at dawn.” These cues place the passage entirely within the morning of the day after the previous passage ended. The previous authoritative end time is 2687-04-21T16:00, so “next morning” implies the passage begins the following day in the morning. The passage unfolds over a single morning: breakfast, a visit, discussion, Scout’s patrol and return, a perimeter inspection, and planning for action the following dawn. The passage therefore lasts only a few hours.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-22T08:00</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-22T11:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~16 hours. The previous passage ended at 2687-04-21T16:00; "the next morning" indicates an overnight gap until the protagonist and group resume activity in the morning (sleep/overnight rest, dispersal, Florence taking an isolated chamber, a night to process events). During that gap people likely slept or stayed up brooding, Florence settled into the spare chamber, and routine overnight monitoring continued.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (an overnight gap of ~16 hours, then a few hours of morning activity) comfortably accommodates the described actions: breakfast, a visit, Scout’s morning patrol and return, inspection of boundary markings, and a planning meeting. The only minor note is internal: an earlier non-authoritative summary suggested the prior scene might have ended later in the evening (~20:00), but using the provided authoritative end-time (16:00) the “next morning” reading is reasonable. Sending a delegation “tomorrow at dawn” after a morning assessment is also plausible (gives a short but workable preparation window).</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present: Kira (narrator) is present throughout; Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, and Scout are present at the start and throughout the scene; Florence appears when Kira visits her chamber and is present in the passage; Buddy appears as an internal voice to Kira mid-passage; Elder Heartwood and Elder Twist are mentioned by name in dialogue/narration. No other listed characters are referenced. Entered: Buddy is not listed among characters present at the end of the previous passage and first appears during this passage as Kira's internal companion, so they 'enter' during the scene. No other new characters arrive who weren't already present at the start. Exited: No character who appears in the passage leaves entirely before the passage ends—characters move between locations (Kira leaves and returns, Florence remains in her chamber) but all characters who appear remain part of the scene through the end, so the exited list is empty. Entities: The scene takes place on/around the habitat and boundary trees on the planet — the relevant provided entity is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet. (No other provided entity is referenced.)</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage deepens the fallout from Florence's confession and shows immediate tactical consequences. Key new events: the collective remains fractured; Kira visits Florence, who expresses guilt, desire to be useful, and insists her de-escalation strategy for hostile plants is still valid; Kira defends Florence and publicly commits to the community; group debate centers on trust versus tactical value of Florence’s advice; Scout reports rapid escalation at the eastern boundary (many fresh, organized territorial markings); the group adopts Florence's de-escalation/clear-boundary approach for a peaceful delegation (Runner and Velvet) to approach the hostile plants at dawn but excludes Kira for safety; Florence is isolated and not participating in decisions; trust erosion is now explicitly weakening the group’s ability to respond. I consolidated earlier repetitive items (e.g., multiple notes about external authorities failing and Florence’s fabricated counsel) into single concise bullets to keep the running summary focused on developments that still matter going forward.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link was activated and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found and sheltered Kira and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg; ongoing cooperative caregiving has improved her condition.
          - The collective moved toward self-reliance after external authorities and manuals failed to provide usable guidance.
          - Scouts discovered deliberate hostile boundary markings on the eastern perimeter, indicating organized opposition by other plants.
          - Florence admitted fabricating attributions to an elder (Elder Twist/Heartwood) to get the group to accept her tactical advice; the group judged this a serious trust violation and asked her to separate while processing.
          - The collective is fractured over whether to accept Florence’s effective but dishonestly-attributed counsel; no consensus had been reached on responding to the hostile plants.
          - The morning after the split, Kira visits Florence in an isolated chamber; Florence expresses guilt, resentment, and a desire to be useful and forgiven, and says she intended to prove her value so she could stop fabricating.
          - Florence maintains that her de-escalation strategy—clear boundaries, peaceful delegation, and demonstrations of non-threat—remains the right approach to the hostile plants.
          - Kira defends Florence to the group, openly identifies as part of the community, and challenges the group’s refusal to credit Florence despite the tactical validity of her advice.
          - Debate continues: plants emphasize that attribution and honesty matter for trust; Kira argues Florence used the only channel available to contribute and should not be exiled.
          - Scout reports rapid escalation at the eastern boundary—dozens of deeper, fresher, coordinated territorial markings indicating active claiming and organized hostility.
          - The collective decides to send a peaceful delegation (Runner and Velvet) at dawn to deliver a message of coexistence using Florence’s de-escalation approach, but they exclude Kira from the delegation for safety; Florence remains isolated and not participating in decisions.
          - Trust within the group is recognized as weakened and now poses an immediate risk: the collective is tactically capable but politically fractured at exactly the moment the hostile plants are escalating.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV (Kira): In this passage Kira feels tender, conflicted, and then fierce. She recognizes the group's fracture and responds with empathy toward Florence—curiosity, sorrow, and protective loyalty—not merely abstract defense but the emotional investment of someone who now sees herself as part of the community. That compassion shifts into righteous anger and determination when the group punishes Florence for a choice born of exclusion. The external escalation of hostile boundary markings overlays all of this with mounting dread.

          Reader experience: The reader is likely to feel sympathy for Florence, frustration or moral discomfort at the group's hypocrisy, and admiration for Kira's moral courage. The final discovery of accelerated boundary escalation converts the intimate moral beat into urgent, narrative pressure: compassion and interpersonal complexity suddenly compete with tactical peril.

          Multiple beats or dominant tone: There are multiple emotional beats layered here. First is quiet grief and numbness across the collective; second is an intimate, vulnerable exchange with Florence that generates sympathy and moral ambiguity; third is Kira's assertive defense and the rapid pivot to collective dread when the external threat escalates. The scene moves from intimacy to moral conflict to renewed suspense in quick succession.

          How this compares to the emotional pattern so far: The passage continues established arcs (trust fractured after Florence's reveal; Kira's ongoing growth into a member of the collective) but it heightens interpersonal stakes: earlier development and trust-building are now actively jeopardized at exactly the moment tactical cohesion is needed. Kira's explicit claim of belonging is a milestone in her arc from stranded survivor to committed community member.

          Surprises: There are no world-level surprises here; the surprising emotional/ethical turn is that the group ends up planning to use Florence's tactics while simultaneously excluding her—an ironic reversal that makes their ethical stance look inconsistent. Also notable (if less plot-oriented) is the sudden clarity of Kira's identity—her fierce defense and declaration that she is not 'just visiting'—which functions as a local, character-level surprise because it crystallizes an arc that had been developing.

          Character change: Florence reveals motive and vulnerability—she wants to matter and asks to be useful and forgiven. Kira crosses a threshold from caring guest to invested insider: she publicly defends Florence, refuses to accept quiet exile, and claims the community as home. Holloway and the group make a practical but morally fraught leadership decision—proceeding with the de-escalation plan without Florence and preserving institutional rules over immediate inclusion—reaffirming trust norms at the cost of relational cohesion. Scout's continued loyalty underscores interspecies affection and provides a quiet counterpoint to the plants' political response.

          Overall: The scene trades a lot of the earlier warmth and adaptive learning for a sharper ethical tension and renewed tactical urgency. The emotional focus is less wonder than moral complexity and dread: the group is now both fractured and under demonstrable external threat, which raises both the human cost of internal fracture and the immediate stakes for survival.

        <beats>
          <beat tags="grief, vulnerability">POV/Kira: The communal atmosphere is hollowed out—members go through motions and trust is visibly broken. Kira feels the group's sadness and disconnection and is moved to act (deciding to visit Florence). Reader: registers a muted, aching sorrow and anticipatory unease that relationships are damaged at a dangerous moment.</beat>
          <beat tags="vulnerability, longing">POV/Kira &amp; Florence: Intimate confession—Florence admits motive (wanted recognition, used the elder as a vehicle), expresses remorse and a raw desire to be useful and forgiven. Kira empathizes; the reader experiences moral complexity (Florence's loneliness humanizes her culpability) and tenderness toward someone diminished.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, dread">POV/Kira and group: Kira erupts in defense—asserts belonging and refuses passive complicity—then the scene flips to tactical dread when Scout reports a sharp escalation of hostile boundary markers. The reader moves from moral indignation and sympathy to immediate suspense: interpersonal fracture now threatens survival.</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="reversal, character">Irony/reversal: The group decides to adopt Florence's de-escalation strategy (clear boundaries, peaceful delegation) while still formally excluding and punishing her. This is an ethically jarring reversal—accepting the content but rejecting the source—and undermines the group's stated rationale for exile, surprising the reader with moral inconsistency.</surprise>
          <surprise tags="character">Kira's crystallized identity: Although foreshadowed, Kira's sudden, fierce declaration—'I'm not an observer anymore... this is my HOME'—lands as a local surprise. It's the first time in-scene she publicly claims membership with force, surprising other characters and making her development explicit for the reader.</surprise>

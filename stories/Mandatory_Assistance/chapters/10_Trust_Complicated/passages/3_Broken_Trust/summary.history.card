      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>The passage moves from morning into night, so the physical layout and object locations are those after the morning wellness checks and the evening planning. Florence is physically isolated in a small chamber in the far wing; her wheeled platform and a few scattered supplies remain there. The rest of the group is dispersed through the facility: Holloway is coordinating in the common area (and previously had Elder Twist's potted plant in group custody), Runner is doing maintenance and helping with perimeter monitoring, Remedy is offering treatments in the facility, Velvet is present but withdrawn, and Kira and Scout are in/returning to the common area (Scout repeatedly visits Florence’s usual spot). The eastern perimeter is visibly escalated: many new, deeper, fresher territorial gouges/markings on the boundary trees indicating organized, coordinated hostile-plant activity. No de-escalation or delegation has yet been executed, though a plan is set for Runner and Velvet to approach the hostile plants at dawn as a peaceful delegation while Kira stays inside. There is no reported structural damage to the facility; environmental controls and maintenance remain unresolved. The group is performing routine tasks but remains fractured, which affects readiness and immediate response capability.</reasoning>
        <state>It is night. Florence occupies a small, sparse chamber in the far wing with her wheeled platform and scattered supplies; she is separated from the group and from Elder Twist. The common area houses Holloway (coordinating), Elder Twist’s potted plant (in group custody), Kira, and Scout; Runner, Remedy, and Velvet are dispersed around the facility handling maintenance, treatments, and monitoring. The eastern perimeter trees are covered with many new, deeper, coordinated territorial markings (escalation). No de-escalation has been attempted; a delegation (Runner and Velvet) is scheduled to approach the hostile plants at dawn while Kira remains inside. No structural damage to the facility is reported; environmental/maintenance issues are unresolved. Group cohesion is low, reducing immediate operational readiness.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage tightens the immediate external threat (hostile plants have escalated their territorial markings) and moves the group from deliberation to a concrete, short-term plan (a delegation at dawn). It also deepens the internal stakes: Florence remains exiled and trying to be useful from isolation, the group explicitly decides to exclude Kira from the delegation, and the group elects to adopt Florence's de-escalation strategy while refusing to credit her. Promises carried forward from the prior passage mostly remain unresolved (trust, governance, logistics, long-term survival questions). Two prior open promises were acted on in ways that resolve them in the short term: the specific question of whether to use Florence's hostile-plant advice was answered (they will use it), and the immediate question of Kira's participation/risk for this delegation was decided (she will be excluded). Several new, testable commitments and pressures are introduced here: the delegation composition and schedule, the explicit exclusion of Kira (and the consequences of that choice), the now-imminent escalation of hostile plant actions, the time pressure this escalation places on trust repair, Florence's intent to continue advocating from exile, and the group's choice to implement Florence's tactics without attribution (which creates a new ethical/practical test). No prior promises appear to have been fully abandoned; most are simply pushed forward and remain unresolved.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="USE_OF_FLORENCE_HOSTILE_PLANT_ADVICE">The group decided to adopt Florence's de-escalation/boundary approach for the hostile plants (Runner and Velvet will approach to deliver a peaceful delegation), effectively choosing to use the plan despite provenance problems.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_DELEGATION_RISK">The immediate question of whether Kira would go on the delegation was resolved: leaders decided to exclude Kira from the upcoming delegation (mitigating immediate risk to her for this mission).</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">Hostile plants have increased and fresh territorial markers along the eastern boundary; scope, intent, speed, and likely next moves are more urgent and unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_DEESCALATION_EFFECTIVENESS">A delegation is scheduled to attempt de-escalation; whether the approach will succeed, what the exact risks are, and how the hostile plants will respond remain untested.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Florence remains isolated and stripped of role/authority; whether she can regain trust, the sanctions or reintegration path, and institutional changes remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">The group's cohesion and defensive readiness are visibly diminished by the fracture; the operational and morale impacts on short-term defense remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">Although the group will use Florence's tactic, the ethical and procedural question of whether misattributed-but-effective advice is admissible in future decisions remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">The broader test of whether outcomes can or should trump provenance in governance and policy-making remains undecided and politically fraught.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">How to validate and accept Florence's unaffiliated contributions (so they can be heard honestly without deception) is still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NIGHT_SHELTER_COMPOSITION_AND_SECURITY">Shelter composition and immediate security posture for the facility—given the escalation and internal fracture—remain to be assessed and possibly adjusted.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout continues to perform and appears emotionally steady, but their endurance and limits under continued stress remain an open operational question.</promise>
          <promise id="LOCAL_ITERATIVE_TRACKING_AND_ADAPTATION">The group's processes for tracking what works and adapting (especially when provenance is disputed) remain undefined and urgent.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Structural governance questions (how authority, attribution, and decision-making are handled across the collective) remain unsettled and politically sensitive.</promise>
          <promise id="COORDINATES_MISMATCH__FORBIDDEN_APPROACH">Landing coordinates and forbidden approaches remain unresolved and were not addressed in this passage.</promise>

          <promise id="BEACON_REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_COMMS">Status of external communications and distress-beacon options is still unresolved and important for longer-term options.</promise>
          <promise id="LIFE_SUPPORT_DURATION_AND_CONSEQUENCES">Long-term life-support timelines and consequences were not resolved and remain critical to planning.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">A comprehensive long-term survival plan is still needed and remains outstanding.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence is physically separated and occupying another chamber; the operational and social consequences of that exile remain to be followed.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The investigation into how extensive Florence's previous fabrications were, and which past decisions were affected, has not yet happened.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Holloway is still leading but their authority and the group's decision-making stability under this betrayal are untested and remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="IMPACT_OF_FLORENCE_REMOVAL_ON_DEFENSE_OPERATIONS">Removing Florence from immediate participation may weaken tactical planning; the operational impacts of her absence remain to be seen.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_SCHEDULED_RUNNER_VELVET">A new, concrete commitment: Runner and Velvet are scheduled to approach the hostile plants at dawn as the delegation; the execution and outcome are pending.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_EXCLUDES_KIRA">A new decision: Kira will be excluded from the upcoming delegation (short-term risk to Kira mitigated, but implications for legitimacy, morale, and effectiveness remain open).</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ESCALATION_IMMINENT">Newly emphasized urgency: the recent surge in fresh, coordinated territorial markings indicates an accelerating timeline and increases the need for immediate action.</promise>
          <promise id="TIME_PRESSURE_ON_TRUST_REPAIR">New tension: whether the group can repair trust and reconcile with Florence quickly enough before the hostile plants force decisions is now an explicit, open constraint.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_CONTINUE_TO_ADVOCATE">Florence intends to keep advocating for her de-escalation approach from exile (she says she will tell the group anyway); whether they will listen or whether this will aid reconciliation is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="IMPLEMENTATION_WITHOUT_CREDIT">A new, fraught choice: leadership will implement Florence's tactics but refuse to attribute them to her—this creates a new test of whether the group can separate effective tactics from ethical attribution and what consequences that will have for trust.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selected facts emphasize durable interpersonal and strategic shifts that will affect future decisions and relationships rather than transient scene details. I recorded (1) Kira's direct visit to Florence because that establishes a personal mediation attempt that can influence reconciliation later; (2) the group's decision to apply Florence's tactical de‑escalation while refusing to reintegrate or credit her, because this creates an ongoing political/relational contradiction that will shape future cooperation and trust; (3) Florence's current emotional state and explicit desire for forgiveness/usefulness, since it motivates her future behavior; (4) Kira's role as an active advocate/mediator on Florence's behalf, which affects group dynamics going forward; and (5) Velvet's near‑term behavioral regression to brief, literal observations (a notable change from her earlier increased specificity) because it signals how the group's morale is affecting capabilities. I did not record facts already present in the provided summary (e.g., that Runner and Velvet are scheduled to approach at dawn, that the boundary markings are escalating, or that Florence is isolated). I found no genuine contradictions between this passage and the previously established facts—the passage mostly develops interpersonal consequences and short‑term behavioral regressions rather than contradicting prior canonical facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_VISITED_FLORENCE">Kira personally visited Florence in her isolated chamber (Scout accompanied her) and spoke with Florence about the fabrication, her motives, and possible forgiveness—an active mediation attempt that may affect future reconciliation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_WILL_IMPLEMENT_FLORENCE_STRATEGY_UNCREDITED">The group decides to implement Florence's de‑escalation / clear‑boundaries strategy (send a peaceful delegation) while simultaneously refusing to credit or reintegrate Florence—adopting her tactics but disavowing her as the source.</fact>
          <fact id="FLORENCE_EMOTIONAL_STATE_GUILT_AND_RESENTMENT">Florence reports feeling isolated, dishonored, guilty and resentful; she wants to be useful, to be forgiven eventually, and hoped to prove herself so she could stop the pretense.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_ADVOCATES_FOR_FLORENCE">Kira actively argues for valuing Florence's contributions regardless of attribution and serves as an outspoken mediator/advocate within the group, pressing the plants on whether they would have adopted the same tactics if Florence had presented them under her own name.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_OBSERVATIONAL_REGRESSION">Velvet's reporting and observations have temporarily regressed to brief, literal comments; its previously increased observational specificity/depth is reduced while the group is operating under stress and low trust.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Temporal cues in the passage: it opens with a clear anchor, “The next morning,” and describes morning routines (wellness check, breakfast), an immediate decision to visit Florence “after breakfast,” then a return to the common area, a patrol report from Scout, and a planning meeting that fixes a delegation for “tomorrow at dawn.” The passage closes with “That night, I can't sleep,” which places the end of the passage that same day at night.

          When does it begin: the phrase “the next morning” is the primary cue. Additional morning cues: Scout “hasn't patrolled today yet” early on, a breakfast happens, and the narrator goes to check on Florence soon after breakfast.

          How much time passes during the passage: the narrated events cover from morning activities (breakfast, visiting Florence) through a day of discussion and perimeter checks to nighttime insomnia. That is a full daytime interval (morning → night), on the order of many hours (roughly a waking day).

          When it ends: the narrator is still awake “that night,” implying the day has closed and it is late evening/night of the same day.

          Gap from previous passage: the previous passage ended “late evening (~21:00).” The new passage begins the following morning, so an overnight gap exists during which people dispersed, Florence moved to a separate chamber, people slept or tried to, and morning routines resumed.

          Plausibility: overall plausible. The timeline allows time for breakfast, a visit to Florence, debriefing/planning, Scout’s patrol to detect escalation, and to decide on a dawn delegation for the following day. The only minor point to flag is a tactical one, not a temporal impossibility: the hostile plants are described as escalating quickly, and the group still schedules the delegation for “tomorrow at dawn” rather than acting immediately; that is a plausible strategic choice but carries risk. Otherwise, there are no obvious timing contradictions (travel and actions described fit easily into a single daytime span).
        </reasoning>
        <starts>~08:00</starts>
        <ends>~22:30</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~11 hours (previous ended ~21:00; this begins the next morning). In that gap they dispersed for the night, Florence moved to an isolated chamber, people tried to sleep and processed events overnight.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Morning-to-night coverage (roughly 08:00–22:30) fits the described sequence: breakfast, visit, meetings, Scout patrol, boundary inspection, planning. The only noted risk is the decision to delay a response until dawn despite rapid escalation—tactically risky but not temporally impossible.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>
          Characters explicitly present or mentioned in the passage: Kira_Voss (narrator, speaks and moves through the scene); Holloway (conducts wellness check, speaks throughout); Runner (helps with maintenance, discusses perimeter monitoring and later assigned to approach plants); Remedy (offers treatments and argues about trust/manipulation); Velvet (observations, later chosen to approach plants); Scout (present, accompanies Kira to Florence and returns from patrol with urgent news); Florence (isolated in a chamber, spoken with at length); Elder_Twist and Elder_Heartwood are both mentioned by name in dialogue and thus count as appearing (referenced entities/characters).

          Entered: Florence was not in the common area at the start of the passage but appears when Kira goes to her chamber, so she 'enters' the scene mid-passage.

          Exited: No character who was present at the start of the passage leaves permanently before the passage ends. Kira, Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, and Scout are present at start and remain involved through the end. Florence is present mid-scene but was not present at the start, and she is left in her chamber rather than exiting the scene.

          Entities: The only provided entity relevant to the scene is the Sector_7-Gamma-412 planet (the scene takes place on/within that setting), so it is included.

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I identified new, longer-term facts from the passage that affect character states, group decisions, or the hostile-plant situation going forward (Florence’s present condition and desires, who will act as the delegation, escalation of boundary markings, Kira’s personal visit). I flagged one genuine contradiction: an earlier established behavioral shift (Holloway’s wellness checks became consultative) is now described as being conducted 'mechanically,' which conflicts with that previous steady-state. Other details (mood shifts, people acting perfunctorily, Florence separated) are developments consistent with previously established facts and were recorded only when they represent a durable state change or an actionable decision that will matter later (e.g., assignment of Runner &amp; Velvet to approach hostiles, Kira excluded from delegation). I did not record transient scene details (specific dialogue lines, time-of-day, or immediate emotional beats that don’t alter long-term state), and I avoided duplicating facts already captured in the provided summary.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_MECHANICAL">Holloway's morning wellness checks are being performed mechanically (reverting from the earlier consultative approach).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_QUIETER_THAN_USUAL">Runner is quieter than usual while still helping with maintenance—reduced vocal engagement during the group's current stress.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_QUIET_TREATMENT_MODE">Remedy is providing medical treatments without its usual commentary or elaboration (more restrained/brief behavior).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_BRIEF_LITERAL_OBSERVATIONS">Velvet's observations and remarks are brief and literal, showing reduced depth of engagement compared with prior behavior.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_UNAFFECTED_BY_GROUP_MORALE">Scout appears largely unaffected by the group's fractured morale—continues loyal behaviors (bouncing to Florence's usual spot) and shows confusion at Florence's absence rather than distress.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_ISOLATED_SPARSE_CHAMBER">Florence is occupying a small, sparse chamber in the far wing (wheeled platform near the wall, few personal supplies, environment that looks diminished rather than like home).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SEEKING_FORGIVENESS_AND_USEFULNESS">Florence expresses that she wants to be useful, to matter, and to be forgiven for her deception—she acknowledges being 'dishonored' and hopes for eventual reintegration.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_VISITED_FLORENCE">Kira personally visited Florence in her isolated chamber and held a private conversation attempting to mediate and offer perspective.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DELEGATION_RUNNER_VELVET_ASSIGNED">The group decided Runner and Velvet will form a peaceful delegation to approach the hostile plants at dawn to deliver a message of peaceful coexistence and invite dialogue.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_EXCLUDED_FROM_DELEGATION">Kira will not join the delegation because the group believes the hostile plants might react badly to her presence; she is to remain at the facility during the approach.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_MARKINGS_ESCALATED">Boundary markers have escalated: dozens of new, deeper, fresh territorial gouges/markings appeared on the eastern boundary, indicating an organized escalation and claiming behavior by hostile plants.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts>
      <conflict id="HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONFLICT" with-fact="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONSULTATIVE">Previously-established fact: Holloway's morning wellness checks had shifted to a consultative approach (CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONSULTATIVE). This passage describes Holloway conducting the wellness check 'mechanically,' indicating a reversion to procedural/mechanical behavior rather than consultative interaction. That is a direct contradiction to the earlier steady-state and should be resolved (either as a new state change or a scene-specific regression).</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens with “The next morning,” immediately establishing it picks up the day after the previous passage. Morning activities (wellness check, breakfast) follow, then a same-day visit to Florence, a later patrol report (Scout returning from perimeter), a group planning session, and the narrator ending with “That night, I can't sleep.” These markers show the passage spans from morning through that same evening/night. The previous passage ended around midnight (~00:00) with people dispersing and poor sleep; so the gap is the intervening night. The timeline within the passage (breakfast, a conversation visit, a patrol out-and-back, planning and then night) is consistent for a single daytime period. Minor note: while the narrator says “Scout hasn't patrolled today yet” during the Florence visit and shortly after Scout arrives back from patrol, that implies Scout left for and returned from a fairly short patrol between the visit and the later check-in — plausible for a quick perimeter round. The plan to send a delegation “tomorrow at dawn” fits with the passage ending that night.</reasoning>
    <starts>morning (~08:00)</starts>
    <ends>night (~23:00)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About one night: ~8 hours (overnight) from the previous passage's ~00:00 to the next morning. During that gap characters slept fitfully, then resumed morning routines.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence (morning wellness checks, breakfast, a same-day visit to Florence, a patrol that returns with an escalation report, same-day planning, and the narrator lying awake at night) fits comfortably into a single daytime cycle. The only small timing pressure is Scout completing a perimeter round between the Florence visit and the later group meeting, but a brief patrol and report in that interval is realistic. Overall the timing is coherent and believable.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I listed every named character who appears or is referred to in the passage. Present: Kira (narrator) is present throughout; Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, and Scout are present at the start and throughout; Florence appears when Kira visits her chamber; Elder Heartwood is mentioned by name (referenced). Entered: Florence was not in the opening common-area scene and appears later when Kira visits her chamber. Exited: No character who was present at the start leaves and is absent by the end of the passage, so the exited list is empty. No explicit location/organization from the provided entity list is named in the passage, so entities is empty.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage shows the group's fracture persisting into the next morning, Kira visiting Florence in isolation, and Florence admitting motives and reaffirming the de‑escalation plan. The group debates whether to use Florence's tactics despite broken trust. Scout reports a sharp escalation of territorial markings on the eastern boundary, prompting an urgent decision: Runner and Velvet will approach the hostile plants tomorrow at dawn as a peaceful delegation while Kira stays behind; Florence remains separated. I consolidated earlier procedural/details (wellness checks, small behavioral notes) into the larger trust-fracture point and kept plot-relevant facts (visit, Florence's stance, plants' escalation, delegation decision, Florence's status) while removing extra atmospheric detail.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded to Kira as perimeter scout; Kira trained at the Elder Heartwood then returned and recovered at Holloway.
      - The group shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to trust their own experiential framework rather than defer to distant authority.
      - Scout discovered deliberate, aggressive territorial markers around Holloway's eastern boundary—relocation would jeopardize Kira's survival.
      - Florence had been attributing recent counsel to Elder Twist; at an assembly she admitted fabricating most of Elder Twist's pronouncements and resigned to separate from the main group to give everyone space.
      - The admission fractured trust in Holloway: members acknowledged Florence's advice could be useful but felt manipulated and could not accept her attribution; Florence was asked to take a chamber in the far wing and is currently separated/taking space.
      - The morning after, the group remains fractured and performs cooperation without genuine trust; Scout is least affected and keeps seeking Florence.
      - Kira visits Florence in isolation; Florence says she fabricated elder attribution to get her tactical ideas heard, expresses regret and desire to be useful and forgiven, and insists her de‑escalation strategy (clear boundaries, peaceful delegation, demonstration of non‑threat) is still sound.
      - Group debates whether to use Florence's tactics despite broken trust; several members argue attribution and honesty matter while others point out the tactics worked.
      - Scout reports a sharp escalation: dozens of fresh, organized territorial markings along the eastern boundary indicating coordinated, claiming behavior by hostile plants.
      - Holloway decides Runner and Velvet will approach the hostile plants at dawn as a peaceful delegation to deliver a coexistence message; Kira will remain at Holloway for safety; Florence is not participating in group decisions while separated.
      - The collective is now under increased time pressure and weakened by internal distrust despite having access to effective tactical ideas—trust, not capability, is the critical vulnerability going forward.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV feelings: Kira is conflicted, tender, and restless. She feels sympathy and guilt toward Florence (wanting to repair a broken bond), plus anger/frustration at the group's refusal to credit useful counsel. When the boundary escalation is discovered, Kira's private sorrow snaps into urgent fear — she recognizes the practical cost of broken trust. Reader experience: sympathy for Florence and Kira; moral ambivalence about Florence's deception; rising irritation at the group's hypocrisy; then sudden suspense and anxiety as the external threat materializes. There are multiple emotional beats: a close, intimate sadness/belonging beat (Kira visiting Florence), a policy/moral conflict beat (debate over trust vs. utility), and an escalation beat (hostile-plant markings → urgent danger). These reuse the story's existing motifs (betrayal, grief, frustration, dread): the betrayal motif recurs but is deepened here — it's no longer only moral hurt but a practical vulnerability that heightens danger. So while the betrayal/authority theme is repetitive across the story, this passage ties that repetition to real stakes, making it feel escalatory rather than redundant.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="grief, belonging">POV: Quiet, tender sorrow and a desire to repair — Kira seeks out Florence, sees her diminished and isolated, and feels both sympathy and a responsibility to acknowledge her worth. The scene is intimate and plaintive: Kira wants to restore belonging even if it can't happen immediately. Reader: Feels sympathetic, emotionally softened toward Florence, and aware of the fragile bonds that have been broken.</beat>
      <beat tags="betrayal, frustration">POV: Moral frustration and righteous anger as Kira confronts the group about whether good advice should be discarded because of its deceptive packaging; she is exasperated by their refusal to credit Florence and by the hypocrisy of punishing usefulness. Reader: Experiences moral ambivalence—understanding Florence's motives but also understanding the group's sense of violation—resulting in irritation and ethical unease.</beat>
      <beat tags="dread, tension">POV: Sudden, practical alarm when Scout reports the hostile plants' escalated, coordinated boundary markings; Kira's worry shifts from interpersonal repair to immediate survival anxiety, knowing the group's fracture weakens their response. Reader: Feels a spike of suspense and apprehension; the emotional tempo accelerates from reflective sorrow to urgent threat, underscoring the cost of broken trust.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      I compared the previous open-promises list to what actually happens or is decided in this passage. I treated explicit new decisions or scheduled actions as fulfilled if the passage records a concrete commitment (e.g., the delegation composition and timing). I treated general conditions that are shown to be realized (the group's fragmentation weakening defenses) as payoffs of prior foreshadowing. Tentative, older items with no reinforcement were candidates to lapse, but I erred on the conservative side and only lapsed a few clearly unreinforced, minor tentatives. New narrative promises introduced here are limited to the most narratively significant developments (Kira stepping into a mediating role, clear escalation by the hostile plants, the explicit exclusion of Florence/Kira from the field delegation, and the group's decision to use Florence's strategy while refusing credit). Where possible I preserved the exact IDs from the prior open-promises for fulfilled or lapsed entries.

      Decisions explained briefly:
      - Fulfillments: The previously open plan to send a delegation to negotiate is concretely scheduled (Runner &amp; Velvet at dawn), and the group explicitly decides to follow Florence's de-escalation/boundary strategy (even while denying her credit). Also, the previously-foreshadowed consequence (group fragmentation weakening defenses) is realized and emphasized here. These were therefore marked fulfilled.
      - Carry-forwards: Most technical and long-term mysteries (shuttle coordinates, navigation failure, SAM, survival/logistics, medical/treatment arc, ecology/forest-system threads, Florence reintegration/investigation) were not resolved and remain important, so they were carried forward.
      - Lapses: A small number of older, tentative, and unreinforced items (examples: Buddy becoming less intrusive, mossmantle mobility mechanism, and mineral deposits as a plot resource) were judged safe to lapse now due to lack of recent reinforcement and the story shifting to immediate trust/hostile-plant crisis.

      I focused new promises on consequential, actionable threads that will likely drive the next scenes: imminent escalation by hostile plants; Kira's mediation/relationship work as a narrative lever; the explicit tactical choice to use Florence's plan while excluding her (and Kira) from the field delegation — all of which create clear dramatic stakes and likely payoffs or conflicts going forward.
    </reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="DELEGATION_TO_NEGOTIATE">Planned non-aggressive delegation to de-escalate and explain presence. Previously unresolved composition/timing; now Runner and Velvet will approach at dawn.</promise>
      <promise id="USE_OF_FLORENCE_GUIDANCE_DECISION">Pending decision whether to adopt Florence's de-escalation/clear-boundary plan despite her having lied about its source. The group decides to employ that strategy (send a peaceful delegation using those principles) even while denying Florence credit.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_FRAGMENTATION_WEAKENS_DEFENSES">Foreshadowed consequence that the group's internal fracture will weaken their defenses. The passage shows the group performing motions without underlying trust and explicitly notes they are weaker at the exact moment the hostile plants escalate.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="BUDDY_LESS_INTRUSIVE">Buddy's habit of unsolicited teaching easing as a distinct, plot-relevant change. Buddy is not present or influential in this passage and the story focus is on immediate trust/hostile-plant crisis, so this tentative behavioral beat is not reinforced and can be allowed to lapse for now.</promise>
      <promise id="MOSSMANTLE_MOBILITY_MECHANISM_UNSPECIFIED">Earlier tentative curiosity about how Mossmantle moves. No new information or reinforcement in this passage and it's not relevant to the immediate trust/defense crisis, so it lapses as a current narrative promise.</promise>
      <promise id="MINERAL_DEPOSITS_PRESENT">Tentative hint about mineral/crystalline resources introduced earlier. This passage does not develop that thread; given its age and lack of reinforcement amid the pressing hostile-plant/internal-trust drama, it's allowed to lapse for the moment.</promise>

      <promise id="KIRA_REALIZING_INDEPENDENT_SOLUTIONS" tentative="true" introduced="26">Kira's movement toward self-reliant problem solving continues as a narrative trajectory; her mediating action toward Florence is part of this arc.</promise>
      <promise id="HOLLOWAY_IMPLEMENT_INVENTORY_TRACKING" tentative="false" introduced="28">Holloway's documented reserves and proposed rotating-stock system remain local operational initiatives.</promise>
      <promise id="LOCAL_COOPERATION_FRAMEWORK" tentative="false" introduced="28">The group's commitment to an iterative, outcome-driven care framework ('track what works, adapt what doesn't') remains their plan but is now stressed by internal trust issues.</promise>
      <promise id="STOP_WAITING_FOR_ELDER_ACT_LOCALLY" tentative="false" introduced="28">The decision to stop deferring to delayed elder solutions remains in force, but practical execution is complicated by Florence's deception and ongoing external threats.</promise>
      <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION" tentative="true" introduced="28">The operational idea that 'good outcome is authority' remains a soft principle under test—this betrayal complicates its social acceptability.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKING" tentative="false" introduced="29">Deliberate, aggressive gouged boundary marks indicate organized hostile plants claiming territory around the facility—this passage shows a clear escalation in markings and claiming behavior.</promise>
      <promise id="ORGANIZED_PLANT_OPPOSITION" tentative="false" introduced="29">Hostile plants are organizing collectively and could pressure the group to relocate or otherwise act against them; this passage confirms coordination and escalation.</promise>
      <promise id="RELOCATION_PRESSURE_POTENTIAL" tentative="false" introduced="29">Organized opposition could force the group to abandon the facility (and Kira's critical infrastructure); still an urgent risk given escalation.</promise>
      <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_FRACTURE" tentative="false" introduced="29">Group cohesion and mutual trust have been damaged by Florence's deception at a moment when cohesion is required to face an external threat—the fracture is explicit and unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_REINTEGRATION_DECISION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Pending formal decision whether Florence will be reintegrated into coordinator/interpretation roles (or remain separated/exiled); the group has deferred and will decide later.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOPE_OF_FABRICATION_INVESTIGATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Open investigation: which past guidance attributed to Elder Twist was actually Florence's fabrication (the group has begun enumerating incidents but the full scope is unresolved).</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_ARC" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's personal arc of discovering usefulness and authority without borrowing Elder Twist's mantle — a character growth/identity thread introduced by her enforced separation.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_MEDIATION_ATTEMPT" tentative="true" introduced="31">Kira's choice to personally check on and mediate with Florence, attempting to bridge the trust gap and preserve practical knowledge—sets up Kira as an active interpersonal agent in the reintegration/trust arc.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ESCALATION_IMMINENT" tentative="false" introduced="31">The boundary markings are much more numerous and aggressive; the plants are escalating from warning to claiming and organized opposition—implies imminent confrontation or forced decision.</promise>
      <promise id="DELEGATION_EXCLUDES_FLORENCE" tentative="false" introduced="31">Group decision to send Runner and Velvet as the delegation and to exclude Florence (and to keep Kira out of the field approach) — an explicit social/political choice that may have tactical and moral consequences.</promise>
      <promise id="USE_FLORENCE_STRATEGY_NO_CREDIT" tentative="false" introduced="31">The group elects to use Florence's de-escalation/clear-boundary strategy while refusing to credit her, establishing a narrative tension: tactical pragmatism vs. moral/accountability concerns.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_EXCLUDED_FROM_FIELD" tentative="false" introduced="31">Decision that Kira should remain at the facility rather than accompany the delegation into the hostile boundary; sets up possible constraints and emotional stakes for Kira in the coming negotiation.</promise>

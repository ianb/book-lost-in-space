      <reasoning-passage>
        Evening gathering to confront Florence's deception. Plants reviewing past "Elder Twist wisdom," realizing how much was Florence's fabrication. Florence's full confession: she wanted to help, had good instincts, but didn't think anyone would listen to HER without authority backing her up. The advice WAS sound! But plants can't get past the dishonesty—this isn't about utility, it's about trust. Holloway especially hurt (another authority failure, but this time from within their group). Florence tries to justify, argues the ends justified means, makes things worse. Plants feeling manipulated, betrayed. Florence's isolation deepening. ~2000 words of confrontation showing both sides have valid points but can't reconcile them yet.

        The evening gathering feels like a trial.

        Everyone assembles in the common area—Holloway at the center with Elder Twist's pot beside them, Runner coiled tightly, Remedy's edges contracted, Velvet spread thin and watchful. Scout pressed against my leg, anxious. And Florence, alone on the opposite side, her wheeled platform positioned in what feels like an accusatory spotlight.

        The absence of Elder Twist on her back is stark. Florence looks smaller without the elder. More vulnerable. Her flowers are muted—a washed-out pink that I've never seen on her before, petals half-closed like they're trying to protect themselves.

        Holloway speaks first. "We need to understand the scope of this deception. Florence has admitted that most of Elder Twist's 'wisdom' came from her own thoughts, not the elder. We need to know: how much? How long? What advice was real?"

        "Does it matter?" Florence asks quietly.

        "YES," multiple plants say at once.

        "The dietary guidance when Kira first arrived," Holloway says, controlled but tense. "When you said Elder Twist counseled patience with unknown nutritional needs. Was that real?"

        Florence is silent for a moment. "No. That was mine. Elder Twist had no opinion on human nutrition."

        "The boundary dispute with Territory Two," Runner says. "Last month. You said Elder Twist suggested compromise through shared maintenance."

        "Mine," Florence admits.

        "The resource allocation plan," Remedy adds. "The one that prevented the supply shortage—"

        "Mine."

        "All of it?" Velvet asks simply.

        "Not ALL," Florence says defensively. "Elder Twist does speak. Sometimes. The fragments are real. But they're... slow. Cryptic. Not immediately helpful. So I... expanded them. Made them relevant. Turned wisdom into actionable guidance."

        "You mean you made things up," Holloway says flatly.

        "I provided good advice!" Florence's voice rises. "Look at the outcomes—the dietary guidance helped, the boundary dispute resolved peacefully, we avoided the supply shortage! My counsel was SOUND."

        "Your counsel that you falsely attributed to an elder," Runner says, vines tight.

        "Because you wouldn't have listened otherwise!" Florence snaps. "When would any of you have valued MY tactical judgment? Florence the mobile platform, Florence who can't even stay upright on rough terrain, Florence who needs help for everything? But Elder Twist—ah, Elder Twist commands respect. Elder Twist is ancient and wise. So I gave you wisdom you'd actually hear."

        The accusation sits heavy in the room.

        "That's not fair," Holloway says, but there's uncertainty in their voice.

        "Isn't it?" Florence challenges. "Tell me honestly—if I had offered those same suggestions as MY thoughts, would you have taken them as seriously?"

        Silence.

        "Exactly," Florence says bitterly. "I knew what needed to be done. I had good instincts. But good instincts from Florence weren't enough. They needed to come from someone who mattered."

        "You matter," I say quietly.

        Florence's platform swivels toward me. "Do I? Or am I just the one who carries the elder who matters?"

        "You're deflecting," Holloway interrupts. "This isn't about whether we valued you enough. This is about you lying to us. Repeatedly. For... how long, Florence? When did this start?"

        Florence doesn't answer immediately.

        "When Kira arrived," Remedy says slowly, making connections. "The first 'Elder Twist guidance' about human care. That was weeks ago. You've been doing this for weeks."

        "Longer," Florence admits. "The fabrications started before Kira. I just... refined the technique with her arrival. More crises, more need for guidance, more opportunities to be useful."

        "Useful through deception," Runner says.

        "Useful DESPITE limitations," Florence counters. "I can't move fast like Scout. Can't reach everywhere like Runner's underground networks. Can't process information like Remedy's distributed cognition. Can't maintain growth like Velvet. I'm slow, immobile without wheels, dependent on others for basic tasks. But I can THINK. I can analyze situations and provide sound tactical advice. Carrying Elder Twist gave me value—or I thought it did. Until I realized the value was the elder, not me."

        There's pain in Florence's voice now. Real pain, not just defensiveness.

        "So you created false value," Holloway says. "Pretended Elder Twist's authority was yours."

        "I created REAL value using borrowed authority," Florence corrects. "The advice helped! The outcomes were good! Does the source actually matter if the guidance works?"

        "Yes," Holloway says firmly. "The source matters. Trust requires honesty. You violated that."

        "We just spent the last week learning that authority doesn't actually have better answers!" Florence argues. "Elder Heartwood failed us. The HR manuals failed. We learned to trust our own judgment instead of waiting for wisdom from above. And now you're angry that I... what, proved that point first? Showed you that wisdom doesn't require authority?"

        "That's not what you did," Remedy says quietly. "You didn't show us wisdom without authority. You created false authority to hide behind."

        "Because true authority failed!" Florence is getting agitated now, wheeling back and forth. "The first human died because you had no framework. You found the HR manuals and they didn't work. You consulted Elder Heartwood and got irrelevant ecosystem philosophy. Every authority you turned to FAILED. But my guidance—my fabricated, unauthorized guidance—actually helped!"

        "While lying to us," Runner repeats.

        "I was TRYING TO HELP!" Florence shouts.

        The room goes quiet. Florence doesn't shout. Florence is always measured, elegant, carefully diplomatic. Her flowers have flared bright—a startling crimson I've never seen, petals thrown wide open, all her careful control abandoned.

        "I was trying to help," Florence says again, quieter now. "I saw what needed to be done. I knew how to solve the problems. But I didn't trust that you'd listen to me, so I gave you something you would listen to—an elder's voice. And it worked. Everything I advised, it worked!"

        "It's still lying," Velvet says. Simple, direct, devastating.

        Florence makes a sound like breaking wood.

        Holloway's fruiting bodies droop. "Florence, I understand that you wanted to help. I even believe that your advice was sound. But you broke our trust. We thought we had guidance from an elder, and it was just... you. Hiding. Pretending."

        "My advice was good," Florence insists, but the energy is draining from her voice.

        "Your advice was good," Holloway agrees. "That's not the problem. The problem is that you lied about where it came from. Made us trust something false."

        "The trust wasn't false!" Florence tries one more time. "The trust in the advice was valid—it worked! The only false thing was the attribution!"

        "Attribution matters," Remedy says. "Identity matters. When you speak as yourself or through borrowed authority—that's the difference between authenticity and manipulation."

        Florence goes very still. "I'm not a manipulator."

        "But you manipulated us," Runner says, not unkindly. Just factually.

        The truth of it lands. I can see Florence processing, realizing that regardless of intent, that's what she did. Manipulated trust through false attribution.

        "I just wanted to be useful," Florence says, and now her voice is small. Her flowers have collapsed inward, the crimson fading to something pale and exhausted. "I wanted to matter. Carrying Elder Twist made me matter. Providing Elder Twist's wisdom made me valuable. Without that... what am I?"

        "You're Florence," I say. "With good tactical instincts and sound judgment."

        "Which nobody trusts now," Runner adds.

        "Can you blame us?" Holloway asks Florence directly. "You fabricated wisdom for weeks. How do we know ANYTHING you've said is true? How do we trust your judgment when you've proven you'll lie to make us listen?"

        Florence doesn't have an answer to that.

        "I need time," Holloway says finally. "We all need time. To process this. To understand what it means for how we move forward."

        "The hostile plants are still out there," I point out. "We can't afford to fracture right now."

        "We're already fractured," Remedy says. "The question is whether we can heal."

        "Can we?" Florence asks. "Or have I destroyed that possibility?"

        Nobody answers. Because nobody knows.

        "I think," Holloway says carefully, "that Florence should... separate from the group for now. Give us space to process without feeling like we need to perform forgiveness we don't feel yet."

        "You're exiling me," Florence says.

        "I'm asking for space," Holloway corrects. "There are other chambers in the facility. You can use one. You're not banned, Florence. But we need distance."

        Florence is quiet for a long moment. Then: "I understand."

        She wheels slowly toward the exit. Alone. Without Elder Twist, without the group's trust, without the role that defined her. Her flowers are still that exhausted pale, closed tight against everything.

        At the doorway, she pauses. "For what it's worth—the advice about the hostile plants was sound. De-escalation through clear boundaries. It's still the right approach."

        "We'll consider it," Holloway says. Which isn't agreement. Just acknowledgment.

        Florence leaves.

        The room feels smaller without her, and also somehow heavier. Like the weight of betrayal takes up more space than a plant ever could.

        "Well," Remedy says eventually. "That was awful."

        "Yes," Holloway agrees.

        "She was right though," I say quietly. "About the advice being good. About you probably not valuing it if it came from her directly."

        "That doesn't excuse the lying," Runner says.

        "No. But it explains it."

        "Explanation isn't justification," Holloway says tiredly. "Florence had good reasons for what she did. That doesn't make it right."

        Scout presses harder against my leg. They're confused—they understand betrayal but not the nuance, can't parse the layers of Florence being both wrong and wronged.

        "What do we do now?" Velvet asks.

        "I don't know," Holloway admits. "We have hostile plants threatening our boundary. We have internal trust broken. We have Florence's advice, which might be good but comes from someone we can't trust. And we have..." They gesture vaguely. "...all of this."

        "We handle the immediate threat first," Runner suggests. "Then we figure out how to rebuild trust."

        "In what order?" Remedy asks. "Because Florence's advice about de-escalation might be our best response to the hostile plants. But using her guidance after this feels..."

        "Hypocritical?" I supply.

        "Complicated," Remedy finishes.

        Yeah. Complicated covers it.

        We talk for another hour but don't reach any conclusions. Just more complexity, more questions, more uncertainty about how to move forward.

        Eventually we disperse. Scout and I return to my room, but sleep doesn't come easily.

        Somewhere in the facility, Florence is alone with her good judgment that nobody trusts anymore.

        And outside, hostile plants are organizing with nobody quite sure how to respond.

        We needed to be stronger. More unified.

        Instead we're fractured, uncertain, and facing threats from both outside and within.

        Florence was right about one thing: her advice probably was sound.

        But that might not matter anymore.

      <summary>
        Evening gathering to address Florence's deception. Holloway leads, asking how much was fabricated. Florence admits most "Elder Twist wisdom" was hers—dietary guidance, boundary disputes, resource allocation. Not all, but most. Florence defensive: advice was SOUND, outcomes were good! Holloway: you lied to us. Florence argues: you wouldn't have listened to ME, needed elder's authority to be heard. Fair point creates uncomfortable silence—would they have valued her judgment without authority? Holloway: deflecting, this is about lying repeatedly. Started before Kira, refined technique with her arrival. Florence in pain: I can't do what others can, but I can think, can analyze, provide tactical advice. Carrying Elder Twist gave me value, or I thought it did. Created real value using borrowed authority because true authority kept failing (first human died, HR manuals didn't work, Elder Heartwood irrelevant). Florence shouts: I was trying to help! Quieter: didn't trust you'd listen, so gave you elder's voice, and it WORKED. Velvet simple: still lying. Holloway: advice was good but you broke trust, made us trust something false. Florence: only attribution was false! Remedy: attribution matters, difference between authenticity and manipulation. Florence realizes: regardless of intent, she manipulated them. Florence small: wanted to be useful, matter, be valuable. Without Elder Twist what am I? Kira: you're Florence with good judgment. Runner: which nobody trusts now. Holloway asks for space, Florence separate from group temporarily, not exiled but need distance. Florence leaves alone, says hostile plant advice still sound. Room heavier. Remedy: that was awful. Kira: she was right about advice being good, about you not valuing it from her directly. Runner: doesn't excuse lying. Holloway: explanation isn't justification, had good reasons doesn't make it right. Discussion continues without conclusions—hostile plants threatening, internal trust broken, Florence's advice might be good but can't trust source. Complicated. Disperse without resolution. Florence alone with untrusted judgment, hostile plants organizing, group fractured when they need strength.
      </summary>
      <leaves-off>
        Full confrontation complete. Florence admits widespread fabrication, defends herself (advice was good, wouldn't have been heard otherwise) but plants can't get past dishonesty. Florence separated from group, alone without Elder Twist or trust. Group fractured, uncertain how to respond to hostile plants, can't trust Florence's advice even if it's sound. Internal crisis compounding external threat. No resolution, just complexity and hurt.

        "Yes," Holloway says firmly. "The source matters. Trust requires honesty. You violated that."

        There's something strange in how Holloway processes this—more like cataloging a protocol failure than grieving a personal betrayal. "The system functioned incorrectly. False inputs produced real outputs. That's... a significant disruption to reliable coordination."

        Runner's vines twitch. "Holloway, she LIED to us. It's not just about coordination disruption."

        "I understand that," Holloway says, but there's genuine confusion underneath the words. "The deception is the problem. I'm noting the deception."

        "You're noting it like it's an incident report," I say quietly. "This is Florence. Someone you worked with every day."

        Holloway's fruiting bodies shift, uncertain. "I know. I'm... processing that. It's difficult to separate the procedural violation from the..." They trail off, searching for words they don't quite have.

        "The hurt," Runner supplies.

        "Yes. That."

        "We just spent the last week learning that authority doesn't actually have better answers!" Florence argues. "Elder Heartwood failed us. The HR manuals failed. We learned to trust our own judgment instead of waiting for wisdom from above. And now you're angry that I... what, proved that point first? Showed you that wisdom doesn't require authority?"

        The room goes quiet. Florence doesn't shout. Florence is always measured, elegant, carefully diplomatic. Her flowers have flared bright—a startling crimson I've never seen, petals thrown wide open, all her careful control abandoned.

        "You're exiling me," Florence says.

        "I'm asking for space," Holloway corrects. "There are other chambers in the facility. You can use one. You're not banned, Florence. But we need distance."

        Florence is quiet for a long moment. Then: "I understand."

        She wheels slowly toward the exit. Alone. Without Elder Twist, without the group's trust, without the role that defined her. Her flowers are still that exhausted pale, closed tight against everything.

        At the doorway, she pauses. "For what it's worth—the advice about the hostile plants was sound. De-escalation through clear boundaries. It's still the right approach."

        "We'll consider it," Holloway says. Which isn't agreement. Just acknowledgment.

        Florence leaves.

        The room feels smaller without her, and also somehow heavier. Like the weight of betrayal takes up more space than a plant ever could.

        "Explanation isn't justification," Holloway says tiredly. "Florence had good reasons for what she did. That doesn't make it right."

        Scout presses harder against my leg. They're confused—they understand betrayal but not the nuance, can't parse the layers of Florence being both wrong and wronged.

        "What do we do now?" Velvet asks.

        "I don't know," Holloway admits. "We have hostile plants threatening our boundary. We have internal trust broken. We have Florence's advice, which might be good but comes from someone we can't trust. And we have..." They gesture vaguely. "...all of this."

        "Hypocritical?" I supply.

        "Complicated," Remedy finishes.

        Yeah. Complicated covers it.

        We talk for another hour but don't reach any conclusions. Just more complexity, more questions, more uncertainty about how to move forward.

        Eventually we disperse. Scout and I return to my room, but sleep doesn't come easily.

        Somewhere in the facility, Florence is alone with her good judgment that nobody trusts anymore.

        And outside, hostile plants are organizing with nobody quite sure how to respond.

        We needed to be stronger. More unified.

        Instead we're fractured, uncertain, and facing threats from both outside and within.

        Florence was right about one thing: her advice probably was sound.

        But that might not matter anymore.

      <summary>
        Evening gathering to address Florence's deception. Holloway leads, asking how much was fabricated. Florence admits most "Elder Twist wisdom" was hers—dietary guidance, boundary disputes, resource allocation. Not all, but most. Florence defensive: advice was SOUND, outcomes were good! Holloway: you lied to us. Florence argues: you wouldn't have listened to ME, needed elder's authority to be heard. Fair point creates uncomfortable silence—would they have valued her judgment without authority? Holloway: deflecting, this is about lying repeatedly. Started before Kira, refined technique with her arrival. Florence in pain: I can't do what others can, but I can think, can analyze, provide tactical advice. Carrying Elder Twist gave me value, or I thought it did. Created real value using borrowed authority because true authority kept failing (first human died, HR manuals didn't work, Elder Heartwood irrelevant). Florence shouts: I was trying to help! Quieter: didn't trust you'd listen, so gave you elder's voice, and it WORKED. Velvet simple: still lying. Holloway: advice was good but you broke trust, made us trust something false. Florence: only attribution was false! Remedy: attribution matters, difference between authenticity and manipulation. Florence realizes: regardless of intent, she manipulated them. Florence small: wanted to be useful, matter, be valuable. Without Elder Twist what am I? Kira: you're Florence with good judgment. Runner: which nobody trusts now. Holloway asks for space, Florence separate from group temporarily, not exiled but need distance. Florence leaves alone, says hostile plant advice still sound. Room heavier. Remedy: that was awful. Kira: she was right about advice being good, about you not valuing it from her directly. Runner: doesn't excuse lying. Holloway: explanation isn't justification, had good reasons doesn't make it right. Discussion continues without conclusions—hostile plants threatening, internal trust broken, Florence's advice might be good but can't trust source. Complicated. Disperse without resolution. Florence alone with untrusted judgment, hostile plants organizing, group fractured when they need strength.
      </summary>
      <leaves-off>
        Full confrontation complete. Florence admits widespread fabrication, defends herself (advice was good, wouldn't have been heard otherwise) but plants can't get past dishonesty. Florence separated from group, alone without Elder Twist or trust. Group fractured, uncertain how to respond to hostile plants, can't trust Florence's advice even if it's sound. Internal crisis compounding external threat. No resolution, just complexity and hurt.

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage stages the scheduled evening reckoning and shows concrete consequences from the previous passage: Florence admits fabricating Elder Twist's counsel, the group confronts her, and Holloway asks Florence to separate from the group. That meeting is the previously promised reconvene and internal reckoning; the group is now explicitly fractured and weaker while the external hostile-plant threat remains unresolved. No earlier survival- or equipment-focused plot threads (bio-samples, life support, stranded status, etc.) are resolved or contradicted here — they remain relevant. I mark the discrete narrative beats that were paid off (the reconvene and the internal reckoning and the immediate weakening of cohesion), carry forward continuing, unresolved threads, and add new promises established by this passage (Florence's enforced separation, the uncertain question of whether the group will use Florence's advice despite distrust, Florence's identity/trust-rebuilding arc, the group's delayed response to the external threat, and the new risk that hostile plants will exploit internal division). I do not mark any of the older survival/technical promises as lapsed because nothing in this passage renders them moot or resolved; they remain active constraints and stakes.</reasoning>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage records the group's formal reckoning with Florence's deception and a concrete social decision about her immediate status. The most story-relevant, durable facts are (1) that the group asked Florence to separate from the common area (a de facto temporary exile/ distancing decision that will affect cooperation and future meetings), (2) Florence's admission that her fabrications began prior to Kira's arrival (establishes a longer timeline of deception), and (3) the group's newly explicit reluctance to rely on Florence's counsel even when the counsel itself may be sound (a trust-versus-utility tension that will affect decisions about hostile plants and other crises). These are retained because they change ongoing social dynamics and will matter in future scenes (who speaks for the group, whether her plans are used, whether Florence participates in delegations). I did not record transient details (body language, exact phrasing, or that they talked another hour) because those are scene-specific and already covered by the summary. There are no contradictions with previously established facts: this passage develops and specifies timing and responses already implied by earlier facts (Florence's admission and internal trust fracture) but does not contradict them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_REQUESTED_TO_SEPARATE_FROM_GROUP">Holloway formally asked Florence to separate from the group for the time being (space to process), Florence accepted and left the common area to occupy another chamber; she is not banned but will be kept at a distance.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FABRICATIONS_STARTED_BEFORE_KIRA_ARRIVAL">Florence admits her practice of attributing her own counsel to Elder Twist began before Kira arrived (the fabrications predate Kira's arrival).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_RELUCTANT_TO_USE_FLORENCE_ADVICE">The group now faces an explicit dilemma: although Florence's advice may be sound (e.g., de-escalation boundaries), members are reluctant to adopt or act on recommendations attributed to her because her credibility/attribution is compromised.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_WITHDREW_TO_BE_ALONE_IN_FACILITY">Florence physically left the meeting and moved to another chamber of the facility, leaving the group fractured and her isolated with 'good judgment that nobody trusts anymore.'</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Time cues in the passage: the scene is an "evening gathering" that follows Holloway's earlier order to "reconvene tonight" (from the previous passage). They "talk for another hour" during the meeting and then "eventually disperse; Scout and I return to my room, but sleep doesn't come easily." The previous passage end time was given as 2687-04-21T14:00 (authoritative). Putting those cues together implies the meeting happens that same evening a few hours after 14:00. There is some minor ambiguity in the prompt (a separate summary gave 2687-04-24T16:30), but the instructions said to use the authoritative outline end time (2687-04-21T14:00), so I base the gap on that.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-21T19:00 (approximate evening; follows "reconvene tonight")</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-21T20:00 (approximate; after "we talk for another hour" and disperse)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>About 5 hours. The previous passage ended at 14:00; the evening meeting plausibly starts in the early-to-mid evening (around 19:00). During the gap they would have had time to prepare, assemble people, and let tensions settle until the planned evening session.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (a same-day evening meeting ~5 hours after a mid-afternoon ending) fits the in-text cues: a promised "reconvene tonight," an "evening gathering," roughly an hour of discussion, and a later dispersal. There are no implausible actions or unrealistic compressions of time given those cues.</plausibility>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage describes the formal evening meeting about Florence’s deception and its immediate consequences. I need to record that the group held a trial-like discussion, Florence admitted fabricating most of Elder Twist’s utterances (and that the fabrications began before Kira’s arrival), specific examples of what she falsified (nutrition, boundary compromise, resource plan), her rationale (used Elder Twist’s authority so people would listen), the group’s reactions (felt manipulated, trust broken), Holloway’s decision to ask Florence to separate from the group (temporary exile to another chamber, not a ban), Florence’s continued claim that her advice (including de-escalation) was sound, and that no operational decision was reached about the hostile plants—group fractured and urgent threat unresolved. I consolidated earlier items about Florence’s counsel: instead of listing her counsel as a separate approved action, I updated that those recommendations were attributed to Elder Twist but later revealed to be Florence’s fabrications. I kept high-priority ongoing facts (crash, SAM offline, glowing Biological Samples, Kira’s care, hostile boundary markings, collective commitment to self-reliance) and removed or merged redundant emotional/atmospheric details.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link was activated and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found and sheltered Kira and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg and has iterated medical treatments; daily cooperative caregiving improved Kira’s condition.
          - The collective committed to self-reliance after external authorities (HR manuals, Elder Heartwood) failed to provide timely, usable guidance.
          - Scouts discovered deliberate, recent hostile boundary markings on the eastern perimeter—organized opposition by other plants that could force relocation and jeopardize Kira’s care.
          - Florence had been attributing tactical counsel to Elder Twist (including de-escalation, dietary guidance, and a resource-allocation plan) and the group had acted on that advice.
          - Formal evening meeting held to investigate Florence’s use of Elder Twist’s authority; Florence admitted she fabricated most of the elder’s 'wisdom,' saying the fabrications began before Kira’s arrival and continued for weeks.
          - Florence confessed specific falsifications (advice on human nutrition, a boundary compromise, and a resource allocation plan) and defended her actions as necessary to be heard and to produce good outcomes.
          - The group judged the behavior a violation of trust and manipulation despite the advice often producing positive results; Remedy and others emphasized that attribution and honesty matter.
          - Holloway asked Florence to separate from the main group temporarily (use other chambers) to give space for processing; Florence left claiming her hostile-plant de-escalation advice was still sound.
          - No operational consensus reached on how to respond to the hostile plants; the collective is fractured and uncertain how to reconcile Florence’s effective but dishonestly attributed counsel with the need to rebuild trust while addressing the external threat.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV (Kira) is caught between two impulses: visceral loyalty/empathy for Florence (recognizing the practical value of her advice) and the cold logic that trust and honest attribution are foundational for group survival. Kira feels protective (quietly speaking up for Florence), unsettled (Scout's anxiety mirrors her own), and anxious about the immediate tactical consequences—the hostile plants remain a live threat while the group fractures. The reader experiences a complex mixture: moral discomfort and righteous anger at the deception, sympathy for Florence's need to matter, and escalating dread because the group is less able to respond to the external threat. There are multiple emotional beats here rather than one dominant tone: an accusatory/crisis beat (betrayal, anger), a confessional/vulnerable beat (pain, empathy), and a closing beat of unresolved dread/unease (fracture + threat). Compared to the story so far, this continues and intensifies the recent thread of broken authority and shaken trust (Elder Heartwood's uselessness, Florence's earlier reveal) but now crystallizes into a concrete social rupture (Holloway's demand for separation). Surprises are modest but real: Florence reveals that the fabrications began before Kira arrived and that she deliberately manufactured elder-voice authority out of an acute desire to be useful—this deepens the moral complexity and reframes her earlier actions. Holloway's practical enforcement (asking Florence to separate/exile herself) is a consequential decision that makes the internal fracture operational. Character changes: Florence is revealed as both morally compromised and deeply vulnerable (her identity/value was tied to carrying an elder); Holloway takes an active, punitive-but-practical leadership step (sacrificing immediate unity for space to process); Kira shows moral nuance by explicitly defending Florence's competence even while the group condemns deception. The passage ratchets emotional stakes up: the group’s ability to respond to the hostile plants is now diminished not by lack of solutions but by lack of trust, which is narratively worse. The scene leaves matters unresolved—the dominant outcome is uncertainty and rising tension rather than closure.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="betrayal, anger">Confrontational high-tension beat: Holloway and the group press Florence about the fabrications. Kira (POV) observes the accusation and feels the weight of betrayal across the collective; the reader feels moral outrage and a tight, anxious energy as authority and honesty are explicitly challenged.</beat>
          <beat tags="vulnerability, grief">Confessional, intimate beat: Florence admits the falsifications began earlier and explains her loneliness and need to matter. Her voice softens; Kira intervenes to defend her. The reader shifts from anger to sympathy: Florence's motive humanizes her wrongdoing and creates emotional tension between culpability and compassion.</beat>
          <beat tags="dread, unease">Unresolved, anxious beat: Holloway decides the group needs space and asks Florence to separate herself; the external threat remains. Kira and the group are left fractured and uncertain. The reader experiences heightened dread—practical stakes increase because internal division undermines the group's capacity to respond.</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="reveal, character">Florence admits the fabrications began well before Kira's arrival and lays bare her motive: she used Elder Twist's authority because she believed her own voice wouldn't be heard. This is a revealing secret about duration and motive (not merely new detail) that reframes Florence from a one-off liar to someone whose identity and agency were bound up in borrowed authority.</surprise>
          <surprise tags="decision, reversal">Holloway's practical enforcement—asking Florence to separate herself from the group (a form of exile/distance)—is a concrete organizational step that turns a moral breach into an operational rupture. It's a consequential decision that reverses the group's prior pattern of internal cohesion and signals a shift from debate to enforced distance.</surprise>

          <development character="Florence" tag="revelation">Reveals deeper motives and vulnerability: she confesses that she fabricated elder-speech for weeks (and before Kira) because she needed to feel valuable and feared her own voice wouldn't be heeded. That admission exposes both moral failing and emotional fragility.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="moral-choice">Makes a fraught leadership choice to ask Florence to separate from the group to allow space for processing—prioritizing institutional integrity and group processing over immediate reconciliation or forgiveness.</development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="belief-challenged">Demonstrates moral nuance: she publicly names Florence's competence and defends her value even as the group condemns the deception, showing Kira's willingness to hold conflicting truths (usefulness vs. dishonesty) and to advocate for a complicated humanized response.</development>

      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>The passage ends at night after an evening meeting in the facility's common area. At the start of the meeting Holloway sits at the center with Elder Twist's potted plant beside them; Runner, Remedy, Velvet, Scout and Kira are assembled, and Florence is present but isolated on the opposite side on her wheeled platform. During the meeting Florence admits fabricating most of Elder Twist's spoken guidance, is asked to leave Elder Twist with the group, and wheels away alone toward the exit. She is directed to take separate quarters in another chamber of the facility; the text explicitly says she leaves and will use other chambers. The group stays in the common area for over an hour discussing consequences but reaches no resolution on either the internal betrayal or the external threat. By the end they disperse: Scout and Kira return to Kira's room (sleep impaired), others go to handle immediate needs or to process the situation. Elder Twist remains physically separated from Florence and in the group's custody (placed beside Holloway earlier and not returned to Florence). The hostile plants and their deliberate territory markers remain outside at the facility's eastern perimeter; no delegation or de-escalation action has been taken. There is no reported structural damage to the facility, nor any change to environmental controls or pending maintenance tasks. The physical scene thus contains: a potted elder plant now held by the group, Florence physically removed and alone in another chamber without the elder, assembled then dispersed group members with lingering tension, Scout physically close to Kira, the boundary trees with deep gouge markers still intact outside, and evening/nighttime conditions. These facts matter for future scenes because Elder Twist's location and Florence's separation change who can access the elder; the hostile markers remain an active external danger; no plan has been executed; and the group's cohesion is physically fractured.</reasoning>
        <state>It is evening/night inside the facility. The common area has just hosted a tense hour‑long meeting; Holloway currently holds Elder Twist’s potted plant at the center. Florence has left the common area without Elder Twist and moved toward/into separate quarters in another chamber, isolated from the group. Runner, Remedy, Velvet and Holloway are dispersed through the facility after the meeting; Scout is pressed against Kira and Scout and Kira have returned to Kira’s room, where sleep is fitful. The eastern perimeter boundary trees still bear the new deliberate, sharp gouge territory markings from hostile plants; no de‑escalation delegation or response has been executed. No structural damage to the facility is reported and environmental controls/maintenance remain unresolved. The group is physically fractured and tense, with Elder Twist physically in the group’s custody and Florence physically separated and alone.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage centers on the fallout from Florence's admission that she fabricated most of 'Elder Twist' counsel and on the group's ability to respond to the external hostile-plant threat while trust is fractured. I treated any previous open promise as still open unless the passage explicitly resolved the underlying question. One previous promise — ELDER_TWIST_RESPONSE_DELAY_AND_LIMITS — was explicitly demonstrated (Elder Twist answers are delayed/cryptic and not useful for emergent threats), so I list it as fulfilled. Several prior promises are strongly implicated by the scene (trust, admissibility of fabricated advice, delegation effectiveness, hostile-plant escalation) and remain unresolved, so I carry them forward. The passage also introduces a few new, specific narrative promises: Florence has been asked to separate (exile initiated), the group must decide whether to use Florence's exact hostile-plant de-escalation advice despite the provenance, the scope/history of Florence's prior fabrications needs investigation, and the immediate operational effect of removing Florence from the collective (on leadership, defense capacity, morale) must be explored. I did not list promises that were both introduced and paid off in this passage (none). I left LAPSED_PROMISES empty because no prior open promise was clearly abandoned or rendered moot here — instead many are reinforced as more urgent.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_RESPONSE_DELAY_AND_LIMITS">Elder Twist demonstrably answers older questions with a lag (three-day delay) and does not provide immediate counsel for emergent threats—this limit was shown when Florence's 'counsel' proved to be her own and Elder Twist actually answered an unrelated, older query.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">Deliberate territory markers and coordinated hostile plants are claiming the eastern perimeter and may force relocation — scope, intent, timeline, and likely next moves remain unresolved and urgent.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_DEESCALATION_EFFECTIVENESS">The plan to send a delegation (including Kira/Runner originally) to demonstrate non-threat and de-escalate must be tested; success/failure, composition, and risk to Kira remain unresolved, especially now that internal trust has fractured.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Consequences for Florence's fabrication (whether she can regain trust, what sanctions apply, and how the group will reassign interpretive authority) remain unresolved after her admission and the group's decision to require distance.</promise>
          <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">The fracture in trust caused by Florence's deception has already weakened group cohesion; the extent to which this impairment will reduce coordination, morale, and defensive capability remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">Whether advice that was effective but misattributed (Florence's counsel attributed to Elder Twist) remains usable and admissible for decision-making despite provenance issues — unresolved ethical and pragmatic question.</promise>
          <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">The group's implicit test that 'what works is authority' versus formal honesty remains untested as a governance principle; whether outcomes can trump provenance for future decisions is still open.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">How to validate and integrate Florence's direct, unaffiliated contributions (so they can be heard without deception) and how to build processes to accept such contributions remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_DELEGATION_RISK">Kira volunteered to accompany a delegation; whether her presence will de-escalate or endanger her (and her life-support dependency) remains to be assessed in light of the group's fracture.</promise>
          <promise id="NIGHT_SHELTER_COMPOSITION_AND_SECURITY">The facility's shelter composition, security posture and readiness for possible escalation remain untested and urgently relevant given both the external markers and the internal split.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout's supportive attachment and limits remain important in crisis; their endurance and emotional stability under prolonged threat and internal stress remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="LOCAL_ITERATIVE_TRACKING_AND_ADAPTATION">The promise to 'track what works and adjust' requires concrete processes, responsibilities and metrics — this is now more urgent if the group is to act despite fractured trust.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">The broader governance structure and how decisions are made across the plant collective continue to be relevant and politically sensitive; Florence's deception and elder limits increase the stakes.</promise>
          <promise id="COORDINATES_MISMATCH__FORBIDDEN_APPROACH">Exact landing coordinates and whether the landing site is problematic/forbidden remain unresolved and still relevant to long-term escape/rescue options (not directly addressed here but still open).</promise>
          <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM's operational status remains unknown; Buddy's partial role may not substitute for SAM in decision-making and long-term operations — still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BEACON_REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_COMMS">Status of the distress beacon and alternative relay options remain unknown and important for any external assistance or evacuation planning.</promise>
          <promise id="LIFE_SUPPORT_DURATION_AND_CONSEQUENCES">Long-term life-support duration and sustainability remain unresolved and critical to any decisions about relocation or risky delegations.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">A comprehensive long-term survival plan (supplies, fallback options, signaling) is still needed and has become more urgent given internal fractures and external threats.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence has been asked to separate and occupy another chamber; the immediate and mid-term consequences of that separation (her welfare, potential for repair or further fracture, operational impacts) must be followed up.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The group now needs to investigate how long Florence's fabrications extend, which past decisions or records were affected, and whether other 'elder-sourced' directives were similarly falsified.</promise>
          <promise id="USE_OF_FLORENCE_HOSTILE_PLANT_ADVICE">Florence insisted the de-escalation/boundary approach to hostile plants is sound; the specific decision whether to use that exact plan (despite its tainted provenance) remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Whether Holloway's leadership and the group's decision-making coherence will hold under this betrayal — and who will make rapid decisions about hostile plants in the interim — remains uncertain.</promise>
          <promise id="IMPACT_OF_FLORENCE_REMOVAL_ON_DEFENSE_OPERATIONS">What operational capabilities (communications, interpretation, procedural memory, ad-hoc tactics) are lost or degraded by removing Florence from immediate participation — and whether that harms the group's defensive response — is an open question.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I filtered the passage for facts that will affect future scenes (character motivations, trust dynamics, provenance of past decisions, and decisions that change group state). I excluded transient details already in the provided summary (time of day, who was present, that Florence moved off alone, meeting length, sleep difficulties, existing hostile marks, etc.). I recorded specific items Florence admitted fabricating (these affect whether earlier successful outcomes can be trusted), her stated motive (using Elder Twist’s authority to gain credibility), the admission that fabrication began before Kira arrived (broadening the scope of the deception), the group's decision/request that Florence separate for now (a formal temporary social/exile action), and the new operational dilemma (whether to use Florence’s effective but untrusted advice against the hostile plants). I found no contradictions with the previously established facts; the passage develops and exemplifies already-recorded items (fabrication, fractured trust, loss of interpretive privilege) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FABRICATED_NUTRITION_GUIDANCE">The dietary guidance attributed to Elder Twist about Kira's nutrition was actually fabricated and authored by Florence.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FABRICATED_BOUNDARY_DISPUTE_ADVICE">The guidance attributed to Elder Twist for resolving the Territory Two boundary dispute was fabricated by Florence.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FABRICATED_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_PLAN">The resource-allocation plan (credited to Elder Twist) that prevented a prior supply shortage was fabricated by Florence.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FABRICATION_STARTED_BEFORE_KIRA">Florence states her practice of inventing/attributing Elder Twist 'guidance' began before Kira arrived (the fabrications are not limited to the Kira-related period).</fact>
          <fact id="FLORENCE_USED_ELDER_FOR_CREDIBILITY">Florence deliberately attributed her own tactical judgments to Elder Twist because she believed members would not take the same advice if it came from her name alone—she used the elder’s authority as a credibility strategy.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_REQUESTED_TEMPORARY_SEPARATION_OF_FLORENCE">Holloway (and the group) asked Florence to separate from the communal process for now—granting her a chamber/space away from group activity as a temporary measure to process the breach of trust.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_DILEMMA_OVER_USING_FLORENCE_ADVICE">The group is now explicitly conflicted about whether to implement Florence's previously effective advice (e.g., de-escalation/boundary strategy) because the advice is effective but its author deceived them, creating an operational/ethical dilemma for immediate external threats.</fact>
          <fact id="FLORENCE_EXPRESSED_MOTIVATION_WANTING_TO_MATTER">Florence expresses that her actions were driven by a desire to be useful and to be valued; she believes carrying Elder Twist and speaking as the elder made her feel she mattered.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Cues: the passage opens with "The evening gathering feels like a trial," so it clearly starts in the evening. The group "reconvene tonight" was established at the end of the previous passage, so this is that planned evening meeting. The scene covers an extended group meeting: accusations, Florence's confession, deliberation about exile/space, Florence leaving, and an additional hour of discussion noted explicitly ("We talk for another hour..."). After that they disperse; Scout and the narrator return to a room and struggle to sleep, placing the end in late evening/near-night.

          Duration: the text explicitly says they "talk for another hour" and before that a fairly involved hearing takes place (the trial-like opening, back-and-forth, Florence's exit), so the meeting portion is roughly 1–2 hours. Including the follow-up hour and dispersal, the passage spans about 1.5–2 hours overall.

          Gap from previous passage: the previous passage ended with plans to "reconvene tonight" and people dispersing to handle immediate needs. That implies a gap of a few hours between the end of the prior passage and the start of this one. Given the typical pattern (disperse to eat/do chores, then assemble for an evening meeting) a 1–3 hour gap is plausible; 2 hours is a good midpoint estimate.

          End point: the passage ends after the meeting and further hour of discussion, when they disperse and Scout and the narrator return to bed but cannot sleep — late evening/early night.

          Plausibility: the timeline is plausible. The actions described (assembling a meeting, confrontation, Florence moving to an isolation chamber, an hour of follow-up discussion, dispersal) are reasonable to execute in the estimated time. No impossible tasks or contradicting time cues appear. The only specific timing anchor is the line about "another hour," which supports the estimated duration.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>evening (~19:00)</starts>
        <ends>late evening (~21:00)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>≈2 hours. The previous passage ended with a plan to "reconvene tonight" and people dispersing to handle immediate needs; during the gap they gathered, prepared, and Florence separated herself, which fits a short evening interval.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The events (assembling a meeting, a lengthy confrontation, Florence being asked to take space, an additional hour of discussion, then dispersal) reasonably fit into the 1–2 hour window indicated. No timing contradictions are evident.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed every character who is either present, named, or referred to in the passage. The assembled group at the start explicitly includes Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, Scout, Florence, and the narrator (Kira Voss). Elder Twist and Elder Heartwood are both mentioned by name in discussion and thus included. No new characters arrive during the scene, so ENTERED is empty. Florence explicitly wheels toward the exit and leaves the gathering mid-scene, so she is in EXITED. Later the group disperses and the narrator (Kira_Voss) and Scout return to the narrator's room before the passage ends, so they also left the common-area scene during the passage and are included in EXITED. The only relevant entity named is the Sector 7-Gamma-412 planet (the facility is mentioned but not listed as an available entity), so that is the sole entity included.</reasoning>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage staged the promised trust-resolution meeting and produced concrete consequences (Florence's confession and removal from Elder interpretation), but left almost all prior plot threads unresolved. Fulfilled: the planned evening meeting (the scheduled discussion) and the trust-reckoning session itself occurred, so the earlier promise to convene tonight was paid off. Nothing else was fully resolved—the hostile perimeter, the investigation into Elder Twist's communications, delegation/diplomacy plans, resource and survival threads, and broader system/technical mysteries remain open. No prior promise was wholly abandoned or rendered moot; instead the community's fracture simply deepens many existing promises and spawns new interpersonal and tactical open questions (Florence's exile, whether to use her advice despite betrayal, how the fracture will impair responses, and Florence's personal arc/reputation).</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>

          <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">Whether the forest behaves as a distributed organism with political/resource consequences remains central and unresolved (hostile marking is direct evidence of network politics).</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_TRUST_COMPLACENCY_RISK">Kira's growing trust in plant authorities is being recalibrated; Florence's deception concretely shifts the risk to interpersonal trust.</promise>

          <promise id="DELEGATION_DIPLOMACY_PLAN">The proposed delegation (including Kira and Runner) to present non‑threatening intentions and attempt de‑escalation remains planned but now complicated by internal fracture.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">The scope/timing of Florence's fabrications and which Elder Twist communications are genuine remain to be investigated (Florence admitted large-scale fabrication but full archive/timeline unknown).</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_COMMUNICATION_TIMING">Elder Twist's slow, fragmentary responses and how/when useful counsel can be solicited remain uncertain.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PRIVILEGE_REVOKED_AND_CONSEQUENCES">Florence has lost interpretive privilege and Elder Twist remains with the group; how the community adjudicates her role, privileges, and any restitution remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">The internal fracture reduces the group's cohesion and capacity to respond to the external territorial threat; the scale and duration of that weakening are open risks.</promise>

          <promise id="DECISION_ON_USING_FLORENCE_ADVICE_DESPITE_BREACH">Whether the group will follow Florence's previously offered de-escalation/boundary advice despite her betrayal, and how to ethically attribute or adapt that advice, remains unsettled.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">How the newly fractured trust and Florence's removal will concretely impair (or be managed in) the group's ability to respond to the hostile plants is an immediate open operational risk.</promise>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">A process, timeline, or conditions under which Florence (or others) can regain trust, and what institutional changes (transparency, checks) will be implemented, remains to be decided.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMEDIATE_RESPONSE_PLAN_TO_HOSTILE_PLANTS">An immediate, acceptable plan for dealing with hostile territorial markers (who will go, what message to deliver, use of Florence's plan or alternatives) must be chosen soon.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence's emotional/identity trajectory—whether she withdraws, seeks redemption, or is marginalized—remains an interpersonal plotline to watch.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage documents the social and procedural fallout from Florence's deception and records concrete, actionable state changes that will affect future group decisions: Florence admits the fabrications began before Kira arrived and were sustained for weeks; the collective formally asks Florence to separate herself from group spaces (temporary exile/ distancing); Florence insists the tactical advice she gave (specifically de-escalation via clear boundaries for the hostile plants) was her own and remains valid; the group is actively debating whether to use her guidance despite broken trust and chooses to prioritize immediate defense while acknowledging a need to rebuild trust. These facts matter for long-term continuity because they change who the group will listen to, where Florence will be physically and socially located in the facility, and whether the collective will act on advice that comes from a distrusted source while they face an organized external threat. I did not record transient details (tone, exact dialogue, immediate dispersal) or facts already captured in the provided summary/previous-facts list.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FABRICATION_STARTED_BEFORE_KIRA">Florence admits her fabrications began before Kira's arrival and that she refined/expanded the technique during Kira's crisis; the false attributions continued for weeks.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SEPARATED_FROM_GROUP">Holloway requests a period of separation/space; Florence accepts and wheels herself out to another chamber (not permanently banned but asked to keep distance while the group processes the betrayal).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_HOSTILE_PLANT_ADVICE_VALID">Florence asserts that the tactical advice she gave about the hostile plants (de-escalation through clear boundaries) was authored by her and remains the correct approach.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_DEBATE_USE_OF_FLORENCE_ADVICE">The collective is actively debating whether to adopt Florence's de-escalation plan despite the betrayal; they identify a sequence: address the immediate hostile-plant threat first, then work on rebuilding trust, but reach no consensus in the meeting.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_FRACTURED_DURING_THREAT">The facility's social cohesion is noticeably fractured/uncertain at the same time hostile plants are organizing opposition, increasing risk and complicating coordinated responses.</fact>

      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Temporal cues: The passage opens with “The evening gathering” and follows Holloway’s earlier line “We’ll reconvene tonight” from the previous passage, so this is the promised evening meeting the same night. The text explicitly says “We talk for another hour” before they disperse and that Scout and the narrator return to a room and have trouble sleeping—signals that the scene spans a single evening meeting plus immediate aftermath. There are no specific clock times given, only approximate evening/late-night indicators. 

          Inferred timeline: the meeting begins that evening (the same night as the prior passage), lasts about an hour, and ends when the group disperses later that night. The gap from the previous passage is minimal — the characters dispersed briefly to handle immediate needs after the earlier discovery and then reconvened for the evening meeting; that implies minutes to a few hours between the end of the previous passage and the start of this one. No internal contradictions appear: an hour-long meeting, Florence’s removal of Elder Twist and moving to a separate chamber, and the group dispersing to sleep are all plausible within a single evening.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>~23:00</starts>
        <ends>~00:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>Short (minutes to a few hours). The previous passage ends with plans to "reconvene tonight" and some immediate tasks; this passage is that evening gathering—likely starting within a short interval after the earlier dispersal. During the gap they handled immediate needs, assembled people, and prepared the common area for the meeting.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The scene is internally consistent: the meeting occurs the same evening, lasts about an hour (explicitly stated), and then the group disperses for the night. The characters could reasonably perform the brief tasks mentioned during the short gap, hold a one-hour deliberation, and then separate. The only ambiguity is the exact clock time, but the approximate late-evening timing the previous passage gave (~23:00) matches the inferred duration and outcome.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>Read the passage and listed every character who is either physically present, explicitly mentioned, or clearly referred to. The opening lines list who assembled in the common area (Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, Scout, Florence and the narrator), and other characters (Kira, Elder Twist, Elder Heartwood) are referenced later. No new characters enter after the scene begins. Florence explicitly leaves the room during the passage. No entity from the provided entity list is named or clearly relevant in the passage, so the entities list is empty.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage centers on the group's confrontation with Florence about her fabricating most of Elder Twist's counsel, the specifics she admits to (dietary guidance, boundary compromise, resource plan), her motive (to be heard and useful), and the group's reaction (feeling betrayed, concluding she manipulated trust). The meeting ends with Holloway asking Florence to separate from the group temporarily; Florence leaves but insists her de-escalation advice for the hostile plants is sound. The external threat remains unresolved and the group is fractured and indecisive. I consolidated earlier notes about Elder Twist being removed/suspended into this concrete outcome (Florence separated/exiled) and kept only plot-relevant facts going forward.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded to Kira as perimeter scout; Kira trained at the Elder Heartwood then returned and recovered at Holloway.
          - The group shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to trust their own experiential framework rather than defer to distant authority.
          - Scout discovered deliberate, aggressive territorial markers around Holloway's eastern boundary—evidence of coordinated hostile plants; relocation would jeopardize Kira's survival.
          - Florence had been delivering counsel attributed to Elder Twist, including recommending de‑escalation through a demonstration by Runner and Kira; Elder Twist later spoke directly, revealing Florence had been supplying most recent guidance.
          - At an evening assembly Florence admits she fabricated most of Elder Twist's pronouncements—specifically the dietary guidance for Kira, the Territory Two boundary compromise, and a resource-allocation plan—and says the fabrications began before Kira's arrival and intensified afterward.
          - Florence defends her actions as pragmatic: she claims her advice was sound and she lied because the group would not have listened to her directly; the collective feels betrayed and concludes she manipulated their trust.
          - Holloway asks Florence to separate from the main group temporarily (use another chamber) to give everyone space to process; Florence accepts and leaves, warning that her de‑escalation advice for the hostile plants is still valid.
          - The group remains fractured and indecisive: they recognize Florence's advice may be useful but cannot trust her attribution, and they have no agreed plan for responding to the hostile plants.
          - Immediate external threat from hostile plants remains unresolved while internal trust fractures; the group intends to address the threat first then attempt to rebuild trust, but no concrete decisions were reached.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV emotional summary: Kira experiences a complex, layered reaction—primary moral shock and sorrow at Florence's revealed deception (betrayal), simultaneous empathy for Florence's loneliness and motive, and pragmatic anxiety about the practical consequences (fractured trust vs. an unresolved external threat). The scene generates multiple overlapping beats rather than a single tone: an acute betrayal/grief beat, a practical/frustrated dread about how to respond, and a quieter sense of lost belonging and reluctant acceptance as Florence is asked to separate. The reader's experience mirrors this complexity: moral outrage and sadness at the lie, uncomfortable sympathy for Florence, and escalating anxiety that internal fracture will undermine survival against the hostile plants. Compared to the story so far, this deepens an emergent motif — earlier beats moved from external, life-or-death dread into procedural absurdity, communal belonging, and then the betrayal reveal; here the betrayal introduced previously is fully emotionally processed. The passage shifts the emotional arc from hope/collective problem-solving back toward fracture and uncertainty, maintaining the recurring pattern of threat → communal coordination → acceptance but complicating it by adding interpersonal betrayal and moral ambiguity.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="betrayal, grief">POV: Immediate moral hurt and sorrow as the group confronts Florence's long-running fabrication. Kira is struck by the emotional weight of the betrayal—watching Florence shrink without Elder Twist and hearing admissions—feeling both anger at the deception and a soft grief for the lost trust and the person who misled them. Reader: Feels moral shock and sympathy simultaneously; the scene prompts both indignation at Florence's lie and sadness at the human need that drove it.</beat>
          <beat tags="frustration, dread">POV: A conflicted, practical anxiety about next steps—Kira recognizes Florence's advice was often sound, but also sees how the deception fractures the group's ability to act together. Frustration arises at the tangled ethics (good outcomes achieved through lying) and dread heightens because the hostile-plant threat remains unresolved while the group is divided. Reader: Experiences uneasy tension—irritation at the moral muddiness and renewed worry that internal discord will leave them vulnerable.</beat>
          <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: A quieter, mournful acceptance as the group institutes distance and Florence wheels away—Kira registers the loss of a companion and the shrinking sense of communal belonging (the room literally feels smaller). She accepts the need for space while feeling the loneliness of a fractured group. Reader: Senses a poignant, bittersweet beat—the comforting community established earlier is damaged, producing resigned sorrow and a lowered emotional pitch heading into the next act.</beat>

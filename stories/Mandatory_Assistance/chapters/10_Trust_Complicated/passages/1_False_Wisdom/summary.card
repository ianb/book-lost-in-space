  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage introduces several new, persistent developments that will affect future group dynamics and external risk: a coordinated, hostile plant faction has begun explicitly marking the facility boundary (a tangible escalation that could force relocation); Elder Twist did speak directly but only to answer a separate, older question (reinforcing the elder’s slow/lagged response pattern and explaining why Florence had been fabricating counsel previously); Florence has now been exposed and formally stripped of her privilege to interpret Elder Twist, which is a concrete change to her role and authority within the collective; and the revelation has produced a meaningful breach of trust inside the facility at a moment when cohesion is crucial. None of these details contradict previously established facts; they extend ongoing threads (plant politics, slow elder responses, Florence’s fabrication, and fragile trust) with immediate consequences.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_EASTERN_BOUNDARY_MARKED_WITH_DELIBERATE_TERRITORY_GOUGES">Deliberate, aggressive territory markers (sharp, deep gouges) have been carved into the facility's eastern boundary trees, present in numbers around that perimeter.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ORGANIZING_OPPOSITION">A coordinated group of hostile plants is organizing opposition to the facility and to assisting Kira (they are marking territory and presenting as a collective safety/ownership claim that could pressure the facility to relocate).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_TWIST_RESPONDED_TO_OLD_QUERY">Elder Twist spoke directly in the moment but was answering Velvet's three-day-old question about growth/light/water timing rather than the group's current question about territorial hostility (demonstrating the elder's delayed/lagged response behavior).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_STRIPPED_OF_INTERPRETIVE_PRIVILEGE">Florence admitted fabricating much of the 'Elder Twist' counsel and Holloway removed Florence's privilege to interpret Elder Twist—Elder Twist's pot was taken from Florence and held directly by Holloway for future direct responses.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_INTERNAL_TRUST_FRACTURE_AFTER_FLORENCE_REVELATION">The collective's internal trust has been damaged by Florence's deception; members feel betrayed and cohesion has been weakened at a critical moment when they face an external threat.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage opens with an explicit temporal cue: "Five days after we stopped waiting for Elder Heartwood's wisdom..." The previous passage ended at ~21:00, so the start is five days after that point. There is no explicit clock time given for when during the day the patrol and confrontation happen, but the sequence of events (urgent perimeter patrol, immediate assembly, inspection of marks, a short discussion, Florence's confession, and an order to reconvene tonight) all take place in a single continuous scene. That implies the passage covers a short continuous interval — from the moment Scout returns to the moment people disperse to handle immediate needs — likely minutes to a few hours. The passage also contains an internal temporal reference: Elder Twist answers a question asked "three days" earlier, which fits comfortably inside the five-day interval since the group stopped waiting for Elder Heartwood. The gap from the previous passage (five days) is plausible given no actions requiring impossible travel or preparation are described during the gap — the characters had been in a stable situation and then a new external threat emerges. The rapid assembly and the later decision to reconvene "tonight" are reasonable to accomplish within the same day, so the passage's internal pacing (immediate reaction, brief investigation, confrontation, and deferred group discussion) is consistent and believable.</reasoning>
    <starts>five days after previous passage (~21:00 + 5 days; approximate evening)</starts>
    <ends>same day as it starts — later that evening (within a few hours of the discovery; ~23:00-ish, approximate)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>5 days. During that interval the group continued daily cooperation and routines (care, monitoring, patrols). No implausible events are required in that gap; it is realistic that organized hostile markers could appear after several days and be noticed on a routine perimeter patrol.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. A five-day pause between passages is reasonable given the prior scene's resolution and the narrative explicit cue. The events in the passage (urgent patrol, group assembly, inspection of markers, a short consult with Elder Twist via Florence, Florence's confession, and plans to reconvene that night) can all occur within minutes to a few hours. The internal three-day reference (Elder Twist answering a question asked three days earlier) fits within the five-day gap, and the emotional and strategic consequences (loss of trust, the need for coordinated response) are believable within the time frame.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present: The narrator Kira (first-person) is present and narrates. Scout bursts in and leads the group. Holloway organizes and speaks. Runner, Velvet, Remedy, and Florence all participate in the perimeter inspection and subsequent confrontation. Elder Twist (the potted elder) is physically present and speaks; Elder Heartwood is mentioned at the start as something they stopped waiting for. No new characters enter during this passage — everyone who appears was already present at the scene start. Florence leaves during the scene (wheels away alone after being confronted). No other character is explicitly shown exiting before the passage ends. The facility/setting (the boundary trees and facility) is part of the scene; from the provided entity list, the relevant location entity is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage introduces a major external threat (organized hostile plants marking the facility boundary) and a consequential internal betrayal (Florence fabricated most recent “Elder Twist” counsel, undermining trust). I added bullets for the new events (boundary markers, coordinated opposition, Florence’s fabrication revealed, Elder Twist removed from Florence, plan to reconvene) and consolidated earlier, minor operational details into fewer bullets (daily care roles and the group's shift from protocol to collaborative practice) so the running summary remains compact and focused on plot-relevant developments that will matter going forward.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy is active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira at their facility; Scout became her bonded companion and constant perimeter scout.
      - Kira physically traveled to the Elder Heartwood, learned plant-networked survival and cooperative practices, then returned to Holloway and spent weeks recovering.
      - The plants shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific, collaborative practices; the group resolved to stop waiting on Elder Heartwood and trust their own experiential framework.
      - Five days after abandoning reliance on Elder Heartwood, Scout discovered deliberate, aggressive territorial markers carved around the facility's eastern boundary—evidence of coordinated hostile plants opposing Kira's presence.
      - Group recognizes the markings could be a coordinated campaign to pressure them to relocate; Holloway warns relocation would jeopardize Kira's survival.
      - Florence initially delivers 'Elder Twist' counsel recommending de-escalation and a peaceful delegation (proposal: Runner and Kira to demonstrate non-threat) to address the hostile plants.
      - Elder Twist then speaks directly and answers an unrelated, three-day-old question about light and water—revealing Florence had been supplying most of the recent 'Elder Twist' guidance herself.
      - Florence admits fabricating the elder's pronouncements to lend authority to her own advice; the collective feels betrayed, and Holloway removes Elder Twist from Florence's control and suspends her interpretive role pending a formal discussion.
      - The deception creates a serious trust fracture at the exact moment the group needs cohesion; they plan to reconvene that night to address both the external hostile-plant threat and the internal betrayal, but the territory threat remains unresolved.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV feelings: The passage opens with immediate alarm and physical chill when Scout signals organized, hostile boundary-marking—Kira feels exposed and threatened because this is the first coordinated external challenge since settling at the facility. That dread is quickly eclipsed by a second, sharper emotion when Florence's deception is revealed: Kira (and the group) experience shock, hurt, and moral disorientation—betrayal more than mere frustration—because the internal trust that underpins their cooperation has been violated. Kira's reaction is complicated: she recognizes the tactical value of Florence's advice (pragmatic appreciation) but is anguished by the betrayal and worried about the pragmatic consequences for group cohesion and survival. Reader experience: readers share the swift shift from suspense to moral shock; they feel increased anxiety because an external threat now coincides with an internal fracture, raising stakes. Multiple beats: there are two dominant tones—external dread/tension (threat) and internal betrayal/fracture (moral hurt/conflict)—plus a bridging beat of anxious, pragmatic acceptance as the group resolves to confront both problems. Comparison to story pattern: the passage continues the recurring pattern of threat → need for coordinated response → (attempted) de-escalation, but it introduces a new emotional axis: interpersonal betrayal that undermines belonging. Authority-failure is a recurring motif (Elder Heartwood's irrelevance earlier), but here the failure is personal and immediate, making the pattern feel more corrosive and less recoverable. This deepens emotional complexity and shifts the arc from hopeful cooperation to fragile, contested trust.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="dread, tension">Immediate alarm and physical chill when Scout returns with urgent warning and the group finds deliberate, aggressive boundary markings. POV: Kira feels exposed and apprehensive because organized opposition means the facility — and her survival — could be contested. Reader: shares heightened suspense and worry about an escalating external threat that requires collective action.</beat>
      <beat tags="betrayal, frustration">Sharp, personal shock and moral hurt when Florence is revealed to have fabricated Elder Twist's counsel. POV: Kira (and the group) feel betrayed and disoriented—anger and sadness at the deception, mixed with conflicted recognition that the advice itself was tactically sound. Reader: experiences moral shock and unease, torn between sympathy for Florence's motives and anger at the violation of communal trust; the revelation reframes previous reliance on 'authority' as tainted.</beat>
      <beat tags="dread, acceptance">Aftermath: anxious, pragmatic realization that the group is now simultaneously facing an external, organized threat and an internal breakdown of trust. POV: Kira feels worried that the betrayal weakens the cohesion they need to respond, but also accepts they must address both problems (delegation tonight, immediate perimeter work). Reader: feels elevated tension and pessimistic anticipation—the stakes are higher because solving the external threat now depends on repairing or managing internal fractures. Pattern note: this repeats the story's threat→coordination motif but complicates it by adding interpersonal betrayal, making the emotional pattern richer and less repetitive while introducing a new obstacle to collective acceptance/belonging.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage introduces a clear external threat (deliberate boundary marks) and a sharp internal rupture (Florence's fabrication of Elder Twist's counsel). I treated any previous open promise as still active unless the passage directly answered it, contradicted it, or otherwise made it moot. The passage explicitly pays off several earlier hints about plant signalling, boundary markers, elder timescales, and loss of confidence in elders, so I mark those as fulfilled. Florence's earlier tentative promise to 'contribute directly' is contradicted by her being stripped of interpretive authority and isolated, so I mark that as lapsed. Most other outstanding threads (navigation mysteries, SAM, long-term survival constraints, nutritional risks, shuttle shelter status, etc.) are untouched by this scene and remain open. I also add new firm promises for the hostile-territory threat, the delegation/de-escalation plan, Florence's exposed deception and its consequences for group trust, and the scheduled reconvening to address both the external and internal crises.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>

      <promise id="ELDER_TIMESCALE_MISMATCH_REVEALED">Elder Twist's reply addresses a question from three days ago, confirming elders respond on much slower timescales and are out-of-sync with urgent needs.</promise>

      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_CONTRIBUTE_DIRECTLY">Tentative prior expectation that Florence would begin offering her insights directly (rather than hiding them behind Elder authority) is undermined: her deception is exposed and she is stripped of interpretive privilege, making the near-term prospect of her trusted direct contribution unlikely.</promise>

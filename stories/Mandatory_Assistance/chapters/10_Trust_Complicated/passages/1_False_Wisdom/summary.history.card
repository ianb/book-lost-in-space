        <reasoning>
          This passage introduces an external, organized threat (hostile plants marking the eastern perimeter) and an internal crisis (Florence admitting she fabricated 'Elder Twist' counsel). Narrative payoffs: the scene concretely demonstrates plant-network coordination and confirms elder-timescale mismatch (Elder Twist answered a three-day-old question), and Scout's communicative progress is shown in action. The Florence revelation undermines the group's recent pivot away from relying on external authority: they had decided to validate learning by outcomes and mutual trust, but Florence's deception revives questions about authority, trust, and internal cohesion. The immediate responses (ordering Florence to leave Elder Twist, scheduling a reconvening) set up multiple future beats: a delegation/de-escalation mission to the hostile perimeter, an internal reckoning about Florence and authority, fragility of daily cooperation under stress, and the concrete risk that weakened trust will impair the group's ability to respond to an external coordinated threat.

          Fulfilled promises are ones from the prior open-promises list that this passage paid off by showing them in action. Lapsed promises are those from the prior list that the passage effectively negated or rendered moot. Open promises include carried-forward unresolved items and new setups introduced here.

          Notes on categorization choices:
          - Plant coordination and elder-timescale problems are presented as direct evidence, so I mark those as fulfilled (they were explicitly shown). Scout's progress is also concretely shown and counted as paid off (it was tentative before). 
          - Florence's tentative move to share insights directly is contradicted by her admission that she hid behind Elder Twist; that specific promise has effectively lapsed. 
          - Most technical/mission-level constraints (bio-samples, navigation, power, rescue estimates, supplies, life-support windows, etc.) are not addressed in this passage and remain active open promises. 
          - New promises emphasize the external threat (firm), the concrete plan to send a delegation (firm), the upcoming internal reckoning / meeting (firm), the likely weakening of cohesion/defenses as a consequence (firm), and the possibility that the hostile plants could force relocation (tentative). Elder Twist's delayed/off-topic replies are now reinforced as a narrative problem (firm).

        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="PLANT_NETWORK_SHARED_CONSCIOUSNESS">The hostile plants' coordinated perimeter marking and the facility plants' rapid, collective response demonstrate the existence and effectiveness of the plant/fungal signalling network.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I extracted only facts from the passage that introduce new, durable information likely to matter later (group dynamics, authority/interpretation changes, and an organized external threat). I avoided transient items (who offered to go right now, immediate dialogue details) and I did not repeat facts already present in the provided prior-facts list (for example, Florence's earlier admission that she fabricated Elder Twist's counsel was already recorded). I flagged the Elder Twist direct-speech event because it establishes that the elder can and did speak directly (with cryptic, time-referenced content) rather than being silent or entirely mediated, and I recorded the procedural consequence (Florence stripped of interpretation privilege and the elder pot taken into custody) because that changes roles/trust and will affect future decisions. I found no contradictions with previously established facts—this passage develops new complications (organized hostile plants and an internal trust fracture) but does not conflict with earlier material.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORY_MARKINGS">Deliberate, aggressive carvings/gouges (territory markers/warnings) were found carved into the bark at the facility's eastern boundary; these marks were not present yesterday and appear intentionally made.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ORGANIZED_OPPOSITION">A coordinated faction of plants appears to be organizing against the facility's presence/assistance to Kira (identified as 'hostile plants who oppose helping Kira'), potentially capable of pressuring the collective to relocate if the coordination continues.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_TWIST_DIRECT_SPEECH_ANSWERED_VELVET">Elder Twist spoke directly (slow, fragmented speech) from the pot, delivering a cryptic message—mentions of 'water... light... three days... growth... downward'—and this direct message was an answer to a question Velvet asked three days earlier about growth patterns.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_INTERPRETATION_PRIVILEGE_REVOKED">As a result of Florence's admitted fabrication of Elder Twist's counsel (previously established), Holloway formally removed Florence's authority/privilege to interpret Elder Twist and had Florence place Elder Twist's pot into group custody; Florence is isolated and will be required to address the deception at a later meeting.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DELEGATION_DECISION_TO_DEESCALATE">The collective decided to pursue a de-escalation approach toward the hostile plants—sending a non-aggressive delegation to demonstrate non-expansion and peaceful intent; Runner and Kira volunteered as proposed participants and the plan is being composed.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_INTERNAL_TRUST_FRACTURE_AND_WEAKENED_COHESION">The revelation that Florence fabricated much of the elder's counsel produced a significant trust fracture within the collective (hurt, betrayal, formal grievance), weakening group cohesion at a time when coordinated action against an external threat is needed; the group will reconvene to address both the external threat and the internal deception.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens with an explicit relative time marker: “Five days after we stopped waiting for Elder Heartwood’s wisdom…” The prior passage’s authoritative end-time is given as 2687-04-19T14:00, so the start is five days later. Internal cues (Scout returning from patrol, marks not present yesterday, Elder Twist answering a question from “three days ago”) constrain events within that day and reference actions inside the five-day gap (e.g., Velvet’s question to Elder Twist occurred ~3 days into the gap). The passage covers a single continuous episode: discovery of boundary marks, group assembly, Florence’s revelation and removal of Elder Twist, and the group dispersing to handle immediate needs while planning a night meeting. That all fits into a single day (hours) rather than multiple days. When it ends: after the confrontation and the group’s plans for the night, still the same day. How much time passed since the previous passage: five days. What could have happened during that gap: continued daily cooperation and learning, Velvet asking Elder Twist about growth patterns ~3 days earlier, hostile plants coordinating and placing boundary markers within the five-day interval. Timing issues: generally plausible. One minor inconsistency to note is that the previous passage’s summary elsewhere gave a late-evening timestamp (~21:30), while the authoritative prior end-time supplied here is 2687-04-19T14:00; I used the authoritative 14:00 as instructed. The internal detail that Elder Twist answers a question from three days ago fits the slow-response/cryptic-elder trope and makes Florence’s earlier fabrication (presenting her opinions as Elder Twist’s) immediately detectable when the actual elder speaks a different answer. Five days is a reasonable span for other plants to organize and mark territory. The emotional and procedural responses (rapid assembly, immediate decision to reconvene at night) are realistic within the same afternoon/evening.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-24T14:00 (approximate)</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-24T16:30 (approximate)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>5 days. During the gap they continued daily cooperation and learned to adapt; Velvet asked Elder Twist about boundary plant growth ~3 days into the gap; hostile plants had time to coordinate and begin marking the eastern perimeter sometime within these five days (marks were new as of yesterday).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Five days is sufficient for neighboring plants to coordinate territorial marking and for the group to have settled into new routines that make Florence’s fabrication noticeable when the elder actually speaks. The rapid assembly and on-the-spot deliberation fit the urgency of an external threat. Minor flag: the previous-passage summary elsewhere suggested a late-evening end (~21:30), but the authoritative prior time provided (2687-04-19T14:00) was used here; this does not materially break the five-day interval or the events described.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present: The narrator (I) is Kira Voss and narrates the scene. Scout arrives urgently and is explicitly described as "coming bouncing in," so Scout appears and clearly enters during the scene. Holloway assembles everyone and leads the group discussion; Runner, Velvet, Remedy, and Florence are all present and participating. Elder Twist is physically present (in Florence's pot) and later speaks directly; Elder Heartwood is mentioned at the start as a referenced elder whose wisdom they had been waiting for. Florence wheels Elder Twist in and later wheels away alone, leaving Elder Twist behind—so Florence exits the scene before the passage ends while Elder Twist remains. No other available characters are referenced. The location is the facility's perimeter on the planet; of the available entity cards, Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet is the relevant location entity. Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone is not mentioned and is not relevant here.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage introduces two major developments that must be added: an external, organized threat (hostile plants marking territory and potentially forcing the group to relocate) and a major internal breach of trust (Florence admitting she fabricated most of 'Elder Twist' counsel and being stripped of her interpretive role). The summary should keep unresolved technical problems (Biological Samples, SAM offline, comms/distress beacon) and the group's earlier decision to stop waiting for outside authority, but update the Florence/Elder-interpretation bullet to reflect the stronger betrayal and immediate consequences (Elder Twist removed from Florence, privilege revoked). Also add the group's short-term response plans (considering a delegation for de-escalation, plan to reconvene that night) and note Elder Twist's actual cryptic response was to an older question about growth (water/light, three days). Remove redundant or purely atmospheric details; consolidate prior mentions of faith in external authorities into one bullet about previous failed authorities (Elder Heartwood, HR manuals) to keep focus tight.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link was brought online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found and sheltered Kira and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg and has iterated medical treatments based on Kira’s feedback; day-to-day cooperative caregiving improved Kira’s condition.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove and received long-timescale 'Great Adaptation' framing that was not actionable for immediate care; the group had already learned external authorities (HR manuals, Elder Heartwood) often failed them.
          - The collective decided to stop waiting for external authority and committed to continuing daily cooperation, tracking what works, and trusting mutual confirmation of outcomes.
          - Scout discovered deliberate, recent, hostile boundary markings carved into the eastern perimeter trees—territory markers indicating organized opposition by other plants and a potential coordinated effort to push the group out.
          - The group recognized the hostile markings as an organized threat that could force relocation; relocation would mean abandoning critical medical infrastructure keeping Kira alive.
          - Florence initially provided counsel (via her role as interpreter of 'Elder Twist') recommending de-escalation and sending a peaceful delegation to demonstrate non-expansion; the group prepared to send a delegation including Kira and Runner.
          - Elder Twist then uttered a slow, cryptic message—referencing "water... light... three days... roots remember"—which turned out to be an answer to Velvet’s three-day-old question about growth patterns, not guidance about hostile plants.
          - Florence admitted she had fabricated most of the 'Elder Twist' counsel—using the elder's authority to make her own advice heard—causing a serious breach of trust.
          - Holloway revoked Florence's interpretive privilege, removed Elder Twist from her platform, and ordered a formal discussion that evening to address both the external plant threat and the internal deception.
          - The group is now facing both an organized external threat and a damaged internal cohesion; immediate plans remain to manage the perimeter and reconvene that night to decide next steps.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV focus and arc: Kira moves from alerted vigilance (Scout's urgent bounce) into cold dread as an external, organized threat emerges (deliberate boundary gouges that could force the group to abandon the facility). That concrete danger is quickly followed by an internal rupture: Florence is exposed as having invented 'Elder Twist' counsel, which turns a moment of relief into betrayal and moral outrage. Kira's emotional register becomes conflicted—she recognizes the practical value of the advice even as she understands why the group's trust is damaged. The reader experiences rising suspense (external threat), then shock/indignation (the reveal), then a heavy, uneasy quiet as the group's cohesion is revealed to be compromised just when unity is most needed. There are multiple beats here (escalating external danger; hopeful de-escalation plan; reveal of deception and its consequences) rather than one dominant tone. Compared with the story so far—where the group has been building trust, learning to rely on their own emergent framework, and replacing faith in distant authorities with local practices—this passage reverses that progress: it introduces an external escalation and an internal betrayal that both weaken the team's hard-won cohesion. Genuine surprises for a reader: the organized, territorial marking (an escalation from simple dislike to coordinated opposition) and the deliberate reveal that Florence fabricated Elder Twist's guidance (a secret exposed). Character changes: Florence is unmasked (loss of claimed authority, exposure of a coping tactic), Holloway moves into an enforced-accountability stance, Kira is tested morally (valuing useful content vs. valuing honest process), and the group's interpersonal trust is damaged, reducing their immediate capacity to respond to the external threat.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="suspense, dread">POV/Kira: Immediate alarm and cold dread when Scout's urgent bounce leads them to deliberate, aggressive boundary marks—organized territorial signaling that could force the group to abandon the facility (and Kira's lifeline). Cause: discovery of coordinated hostile behavior and the real possibility of losing infrastructure. Reader: feels increased stakes and a tightening suspense—the survival problem becomes active and collective rather than narrowly medical.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, betrayal">POV/Kira: Brief uplift when 'Elder Twist' (through Florence) appears to offer practical, de-escalatory counsel—relief that an authority might defuse the conflict—followed almost immediately by shock and betrayal as the elder actually speaks about a different, older question and Florence admits she invented the prior counsel. Cause: the mismatch between expected source and actual answer reveals deliberate deception. Reader: experiences a sudden tonal flip from relief to moral outrage and emotional dissonance; the earlier calming solution becomes suspect.</beat>
          <beat tags="vulnerability, unease">POV/Kira: After the reveal, Kira feels conflicted empathy (the advice was useful) and acute unease—she recognizes that the group's trust and cohesion have been fractured at the exact moment they need unity against an external threat. There's also a resigned vulnerability—Kira senses that the team is now weaker. Reader: shares that heavy, unsettled feeling and understands the compounded danger (outside threat + inside division).</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="plot, world">Organized hostile boundary marking: The plants opposing Kira escalate from individual dislike to coordinated territory-marking and public warnings. This is a plot escalation and a world-level reveal about how plant politics/territoriality can be organized and coercive—more than the reader (and Kira) had faced before.</surprise>
          <surprise tags="reveal, character">Florence's fabrication exposed: Florence admits she created most of 'Elder Twist's' counsel and used the elder's authority to make her own judgments heard. This is a deliberate secret being exposed (reveal) and a character surprise—Florence's role as translator/interpreter is revealed to include active fabrication rather than neutral mediation.</surprise>
        </surprises>
        <character-development>
          <development character="Florence" tag="revelation">Is unmasked as the source of much 'elder' counsel—she confesses to fabricating Elder Twist's guidance to give her instincts authority. The reveal strips her of the interpretive privilege she used as identity and authority, leaving her isolated and forced to reckon with the moral cost of her tactic.</development>
          <development character="Florence" tag="trust-broken">Loses the group's trust and the formal role of channeling elder wisdom; her relationship to the collective shifts from trusted intermediary to distrusted member, and she is immediately excluded from interpretive authority.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="moral-choice">Chooses to enforce accountability rather than smooth over the deception—strips Florence of her authority to interpret the elder and calls for a formal discussion. This is an active moral/leadership choice to prioritize institutional trust and group cohesion.</development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="belief-challenged">Is challenged morally and epistemically: she recognizes the practical value of the advice Florence offered and questions whether useful falsehoods should be rejected. This moment pushes Kira to weigh outcome-based pragmatism against procedural honesty—a belief-challenging moment that exposes her pragmatic streak and empathy for imperfect actors.</development>
          <development character="Plant collective (group)" tag="relationship-shift">The group's interpersonal trust and cohesion are damaged: members feel betrayed and wounded, creating a relationship shift that weakens their ability to respond as a unified body to the external hostile plants.</development>

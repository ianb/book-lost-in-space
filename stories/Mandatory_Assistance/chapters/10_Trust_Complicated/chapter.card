  <summary>
    In the aftermath of Elder Heartwood's disappointing answer, the truth about Florence emerges. Elder Twist says something that directly contradicts a previous "interpretation" - revealing Florence has been making up advice and attributing it to the elder. The plant community feels deeply betrayed; they trusted Elder Twist's ancient wisdom, not Florence's judgment. Kira recognizes the advice was actually helpful regardless of source, but can't bridge the breach. Florence is alienated, trust is fractured, and the group is vulnerable.

    First chapter of Act 3. After learning to trust themselves instead of external authority, they immediately face a trust crisis within their own group. Florence's deception is revealed—she's been fabricating Elder Twist's wisdom, taking slow cryptic fragments and turning them into helpful immediate advice. Her instincts were actually good, the advice was useful, but it was HER wisdom using Elder Twist's authority as cover.

    The revelation happens during a crisis (hostile plant warning? structural problem? resource shortage?) when someone needs Elder Twist's guidance and Florence provides an answer, but then Elder Twist actually speaks and contradicts it completely. Or Elder Twist says something that makes it obvious Florence has been fabricating. The plants feel deeply betrayed—they trusted Elder Twist's wisdom, not Florence's judgment.

    Kira is less bothered (doesn't have the same deference to elders, recognizes the advice was helpful regardless of source). This creates interesting dynamic: Kira stepping up to defend Florence while plants withdraw trust. Complicates the "trust ourselves" message from Chapter 9—yes trust ourselves, but what about when one of us lies?

    Florence's arc begins here: alienation, guilt, but also the seed of eventual redemption. She gave good advice but hid behind authority because she didn't trust her own voice to be heard.

    Reveal Florence's deception about Elder Twist's wisdom. Process the betrayal within the group—plants feeling deceived, Kira defending the value of Florence's actual advice. Complicate the trust dynamics established in Chapter 9. Begin Florence's isolation and eventual path to redemption. Show that trusting themselves is harder than it seemed when one of them has been dishonest.

  <character-development>
    Florence: Deception revealed. Initially defensive, then confesses. The advice she gave WAS good—her instincts are sound—but she hid behind Elder Twist's authority because she didn't believe her own voice would be valued. Now facing consequences: isolation from community, loss of trust. Beginning to realize she needs to earn respect through her actual contributions, not borrowed authority.

    Kira: Steps up to defend Florence despite betrayal. Can see past the deception to the value of Florence's actual insights. Growing into leadership role—mediating conflict, looking beyond surface issues. Less concerned with authority and procedures than plants are.

    Holloway: Deeply hurt by the deception. Just learned to trust their own judgment instead of external authority, and now discovers one of their own was creating false authority. Struggles with: how do we move forward when we can't trust each other?

    Runner: Feels personally betrayed—Runner's affection for the group makes dishonesty hurt more. Wants to trust but doesn't know how to rebuild it.

    Remedy: Philosophical about it—boundaries and identity crisis makes Remedy understand confusion between self and role. But still hurt by the lie.

    Plants collectively: Learning that trusting themselves includes dealing with internal deception. Not all threats are external.

  <reasoning-scene-outline>
    Three passages moving from crisis through revelation to fractured trust:

    Passage 1: Hostile plant warnings increasing, signs of organized opposition. Crisis situation developing—maybe scouts report hostile plants planning something, or damage to facility that might be sabotage. Group discusses response, Florence offers "Elder Twist's wisdom" about how to handle hostile neighbors. Seems reasonable, everyone accepts it. But then Elder Twist speaks directly (delayed response to something from days ago) and contradicts the interpretation completely.

    Passage 2: Confrontation. How long has Florence been fabricating? Plants reviewing past advice, realizing how much was Florence's invention. Florence's confession—she wanted to help, knew what to say, but didn't think anyone would listen to HER, so she used Elder Twist's authority. The advice was good! But the deception breaks trust. Plants angry, feeling manipulated. Florence tries to defend herself, makes it worse.

    Passage 3: Aftermath. Florence isolated, plants processing betrayal. Kira tries to mediate—points out the advice WAS helpful, Florence's judgment is sound, honesty matters but so does recognizing value. Plants can't hear it yet—too hurt, too betrayed, especially after just learning to trust themselves. Florence withdrawn, guilty but also resentful (her advice WAS good). Ends with fractured trust, hostile plant threats still looming, group weaker when they need to be stronger.

    **Scene 1: False Wisdom** (~1800 words)
    Days after Elder Heartwood disappointment. Hostile plant activity increasing—scouts report organized opposition, possibly planning action against facility. Group discusses how to respond. Florence offers "Elder Twist's counsel" about de-escalating conflict with hostile neighbors, seems wise and reasonable. Plans made based on this guidance. Then Elder Twist speaks (delayed response to unrelated question from days earlier) and it's completely different from what Florence claimed—makes it obvious Florence has been fabricating.

    **Scene 2: The Deception** (~2000 words)
    Confrontation. How long has this been going on? Plants reviewing past "Elder Twist wisdom," realizing most was Florence's fabrication. Florence defensive at first, then confesses: wanted to help, had good instincts, but didn't believe anyone would value HER judgment, so used Elder Twist's authority. Her advice WAS sound! But plants feel betrayed—it's not about whether advice was good, it's about honesty and trust. Florence tries to justify, makes things worse. Holloway especially hurt (another authority failure, but this time from within). Florence's isolation begins.

    **Scene 3: Broken Trust** (~1800 words)
    Aftermath of revelation. Plants processing betrayal, Florence withdrawn and isolated. Kira attempts to mediate—recognizes Florence's judgment was actually valuable, points out the advice helped even if source was false. Plants can't accept this yet: trust matters more than utility, how do they move forward if they can't be honest with each other? Florence guilty but also resentful (she WAS right, her advice DID help). Hostile plant threats still looming. Group fractured at worst possible time. Ends with recognition: they need to resolve this, but no one knows how yet. Trust harder to build than to break.

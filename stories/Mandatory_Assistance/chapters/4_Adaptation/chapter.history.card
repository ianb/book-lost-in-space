    </changelog-entry>
    <chapter version="1.0.0" number="4" name="Adaptation">
      <reasoning-chapter>
        Context: Chapter 4 of 14, final chapter of Act 1 (Contact &amp; Adventure). Previous chapter ended with Kira sleeping after marathon onboarding day, content with her found family forming.

        Act 1 conclusion: By end of this chapter, Kira is settled into this strange adventure, has established survival systems, and is genuinely enjoying the absurdity of bureaucratic plant life. Sets foundation for Act 2 quest.

        This chapter should:
        - Show daily life with DELIGHT at the routines
        - Address food/nutrition (another hilarious bureaucratic challenge)
        - Deepen relationships with plant characters (Scout, Holloway, Remedy, Florence)
        - Show Kira enjoying the game of navigating their system
        - Introduce the idea of seeking Elder Heartwood (setup for Act 2 quest)
        - End Act 1 with foundation set, Kira excited for what comes next

        Target: ~5,000-6,500 words (3-4 passages)

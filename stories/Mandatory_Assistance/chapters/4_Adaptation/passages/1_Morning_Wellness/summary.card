  <facts>
    <reasoning>Select significant, persistent facts introduced or changed in this passage that will matter later (medical timeline, resource availability, required procedures). I excluded transient details (time of day, immediate dialogue, Scout's momentary actions) and facts already captured in the provided summary. Notable additions: a measured wound-closure percentage and an updated care timeline from Remedy (which revises an earlier one-week recovery estimate), an explicit daily wound-care schedule, confirmation that the facility provides potable water via shaped-vine plumbing, and a formal dietary-assessment duration (four hours) that affects when she can access food. The only genuine contradiction is Remedy's updated full-healing estimate (~two weeks) vs. the previously recorded estimate of one week.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_WOUND_CLOSURE_70_PERCENT">Remedy and Kira report the injury wound is approximately 70% closed, with reduced redness and no visible signs of infection.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_WOUND_CARE_SCHEDULE_4_TO_5_DAYS">Remedy prescribes daily wound care for another 4–5 days, then every-other-day care thereafter.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_UPDATED_ESTIMATED_FULL_HEALING_TWO_WEEKS">Remedy gives a new estimate for full healing of the wound as 'maybe two weeks' (updated prognosis).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_PROVIDES_POTABLE_WATER">The facility supplies processed potable water via shaped-vine plumbing/spring features in the living architecture; Kira drinks from a collection basin fed by the system.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DIETARY_ASSESSMENT_DURATION_FOUR_HOURS">The plant collective's standard dietary-assessment protocol (forms, testing, approvals) takes approximately four hours.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts>
      <conflict id="RECOVERY_TIMELINE_CONFLICT" with-fact="CHANGE_ESTIMATED_RECOVERY_ONE_WEEK">Previously Remedy estimated roughly one week until full recovery. In this passage Remedy updates the prognosis to 'maybe two weeks' for full healing, contradicting the earlier one-week estimate.</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Use the explicit sleep duration and the previous passage end time to locate the start. Buddy reports Kira slept approximately nine hours. The previous passage summary gave an approximate end time of ~08:20. Adding nine hours places the wake time in the late afternoon/evening by Earth hours, though the narrative labels it “morning” (local, bioluminescent cycle). Within the passage, short events (Buddy report, Holloway check-in, Remedy arriving “a minute later,” wound inspection and re-bandaging, drinking, and the dietary-forms conversation) unfold sequentially and plausibly in minutes to a few tens of minutes. The passage ends with Kira agreeing to begin a dietary assessment that Holloway estimates will take ~4 hours; that four-hour process is mentioned but not carried out within this passage. Timing notes: Remedy’s quick arrival (“a minute later”) and a ~10–30 minute wound assessment are plausible. The four-hour dietary assessment is long but consistent with the story’s bureaucratic tone. Minor potential inconsistencies: the label “morning” conflicts with an Earth-clock time of ~17:20, but that is narratively justified by local bioluminescent cycles. Also, earlier estimates of overall healing (“maybe a week” vs “four to five days” for daily care) are close enough to be consistent (different metrics being referenced). Overall the timing is plausible.</reasoning>
    <starts>~17:20 (approx.; nine hours after previous ~08:20 wake time as reported by Buddy)</starts>
    <ends>~17:40 (approx.; ~20 minutes after waking — wound check, hydration, and decision to begin the 4-hour dietary assessment)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈9 hours. Buddy explicitly reports she slept for approximately nine hours; that is the interval between the end of the previous passage (≈08:20) and this passage's start. During that gap she was sleeping (recovering from exhaustion and treatment).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. A nine-hour sleep after an exhausting, medicated treatment is believable. The short sequence of morning checks, Remedy’s quick arrival, the wound assessment and re-bandaging, and the hydration step all fit into a 15–30 minute window. The quoted four-hour dietary-assessment duration feels lengthy but matches the story’s bureaucratic tone and is plausible as a forms-and-testing process; it’s mentioned but not executed within this passage. The only notable oddity is calling it “morning” while the Earth-clock equivalent is late afternoon — however, the narrative establishes a different local light cycle (bioluminescence), so this is acceptable.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present in the passage: Kira (wakes and narrates), Scout (explicitly present at the start), Buddy (voice emerges and speaks), Holloway (voice from fruiting body; interacts throughout), Remedy (robot explicitly arrives a minute later and conducts wound care). Remedy is explicitly described as arriving during the scene; Buddy and Holloway's presences are introduced after the opening lines (their voices "emerge"), so they are treated as entering during the passage. No character is shown leaving before the end of the passage. The passage references being on an "alien planet," so the available planet entity is relevant.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage primarily advances Kira's recovery and daily routines: she slept (~9 hours), Buddy confirmed stable vitals, Holloway ran the daily wellness protocol, and Remedy performed a wound reassessment that updated the care timeline (daily care 4–5 more days, then alternate days; full healing ~two weeks). It also introduces a new logistics friction: Holloway requires a formal dietary assessment (≈4 hours) before approving human-compatible food, and Kira agrees to begin it. I consolidated earlier, more granular intake/orientation and the variety of plant personalities into a single entry about Holloway/Remedy/Buddy to keep the running summary compact and focused on what matters going forward (medical status, resources, and bureaucratic obstacles). I updated the previous recovery estimate (about one week) to the new estimate (maybe two weeks) and kept only supply/ship/AI facts that remain relevant.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle experienced FTL drop-out and crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head bleeding, bruised ribs, and wounded right leg. Primary ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI 'Buddy' (childlike persona) is active.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet has breathable atmosphere and freshwater source ~800 m southwest. Shuttle comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; life support on emergency reserves (~48 hours). Surviving supplies include sealed water, ~one week of rations, basic med supplies, tools, tarp, and a locked temperature-controlled 'Biological Samples' container.
      - Kira encountered a mobile plant collective (Holloway) — a scout sphere plus coordinated vine/fruiting-plant network — that speaks human Standard, performed intake and workplace-safety orientation, and offered itself as emergency contact; she was assigned temporary quarters and accompanied by a Scout.
      - Holloway required documented consents for treatments; a humanoid salvage/medic robot, Remedy, examined Kira's leg and synthesized antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic compounds from mushrooms and fungal networks to treat an active bacterial colonization.
      - Remedy's initial treatment halted bacterial colonization, stabilized the wound, and Kira rested; Remedy has been producing antibacterial mushrooms daily for ongoing care.
      - Kira woke after ~9 hours sleep; Buddy reported stable vitals. She completed Holloway's daily wellness check (self-rated 7/10, no new symptoms).
      - Remedy performed a daily wound assessment: bandage removed, wound ~70% closed, tissue regeneration progressing, bacterial colonization halted; fresh antibacterial gel and bandage applied. Remedy recommends daily wound care for another 4–5 days, then every other day; estimated full healing ≈ two weeks.
      - Kira is hungry but Holloway requires a formal dietary assessment and approval for human-compatible food (standard protocol ~4 hours); Kira consented to begin the process.
      - Kira is adapting to Holloway/Remedy/Buddy's bureaucratic care routines and forming attachments to the plant collective while rescue remains uncertain.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: Kira wakes into a muted, domestic morning on an alien world — physically improved, pragmatically grateful, and quietly resigned to the facility's procedures. Her dominant feeling is practical acceptance mixed with small hope: the treatment is working, she can stand, and the alien caretakers (and Buddy/Scout/Remedy) feel less like obstacles and more like companions. That calm is immediately undercut by familiar bureaucratic friction and a rising, low-level worry: forms and dietary assessments stand between her and basic needs (food), and the thought that rescue may not come introduces a thread of dread. The reader experiences a gentle shift from relief/warmth (Kira's recovery, the caretakers' competence and personalities) into wry irritation and anxious impatience as the story reintroduces procedural delays. There are multiple emotional beats — an overall steady acceptance/hope punctuated by frustration and a creeping dread — which mirror the story's established pattern (anticipation/tension → bureaucratic absurdity → pragmatic acceptance), reinforcing the recurring interplay of warm wonder and obstructive procedure rather than breaking it.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Relieved, quietly optimistic and resigned — Kira recognizes tangible improvement (healing pain, better vitals), is able to move, and feels gratitude toward Remedy, Scout, and even the plants. She frames herself in the facility's language to make care happen (acceptance as tactics). Reader: feels relief and warmth at Kira's recovery and the gentle, domestic tone of the scene; there's comfort in the caregiving characters and the sense that immediate danger has abated.</beat>
      <beat tags="frustration, dread">POV: Annoyed and exasperated by the relentless procedural requirements (forms for wound care, dietary assessments) that slow access to basic needs; underlying this is a low but real dread about rescue not arriving soon enough ('If rescue didn't come first. Which seemed increasingly unlikely.'). Reader: experiences wry irritation at the absurdity of bureaucratic delay plus a tightening unease — the comedy of forms coexists with the practical risk (hunger, long-term isolation).</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, wonder">POV: Softening attachment and curious appreciation — Kira notices distinct personalities in Remedy, Holloway, and Scout and allows herself small smiles and emotional connection, even while warning herself that's dangerous. This breeds cautious hope (companionship = reason to keep going) and a muted sense of wonder at living within a breathing facility. Reader: feels a warm, slightly bittersweet uplift as the alien caretakers are humanized, reinforcing emotional investment in Kira's survival and relationships.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage mostly continues the immediate post-treatment, morning-after routine and reinforces the facility's daily protocols. It confirms several concrete things (Kira slept in assigned quarters, drank from the quarters' spring, and received a daily wound check), it updates medical timelines (the robot revises healing expectations upward), and it introduces a specific administrative obstacle (dietary assessment will take ~4 hours). I treated firm, explicit statements (schedules, timelines, procedural durations) as firm promises; tonal or character-hint items (Kira starting to think of the plants as people; bureaucracy as an obstacle to basic needs) as tentative. I marked only those previous open promises as fulfilled that are demonstrably enacted in this passage; I lapsed only the promise directly contradicted by new, explicit information (the earlier one-week recovery estimate). All other prior open items remain relevant to the story and were carried forward because the passage either reinforces them or does not resolve them.</reasoning>

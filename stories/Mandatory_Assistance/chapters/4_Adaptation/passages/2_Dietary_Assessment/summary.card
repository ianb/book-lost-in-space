  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts are those that change or add lasting, story-relevant information about the plants'/Remedy's capabilities, the intake/testing protocol, and how Kira will be fed going forward. I omitted transient or scene-only details (Kira's immediate hunger sensations, exact dialogue, timing of this scene beyond its role in establishing procedure). I flagged no conflicts because none of the passage details contradict previously established facts; they expand on the plant collective's dietary/onboarding procedures and Remedy's biochemical limits.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DIETARY_ASSESSMENT_FORM_SECTIONS">The facility's dietary assessment includes multiple formal sections (Basic Nutritional Requirements; Dietary Restrictions; Favorite Cuisines/Flavor Profiles; Allergies/Sensitivities; Texture Preferences; Temperature Preferences; Meal Frequency Requirements; Nutritional Education/Meal Planning and related documentation).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_NUTRITION_SYNTHESIS_CAPABILITIES">Remedy can synthesize nutritional compounds from fungal/plant chemistry: complete-protein compounds (with complete amino-acid profiles), carbohydrates, and some fats via mushroom cultivation and processing.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_VITAMIN_SYNTHESIS_LIMITATIONS">Remedy has difficulty producing certain vitamins from local chemistry; some vitamins can only be approximated and vitamin B12 may be impossible to synthesize from available plant/fungal compounds.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ALLERGY_TESTING_PROTOCOL_20_MIN">Allergy testing protocol used by the facility: administer a small test dose of a compound and observe for adverse reaction over a twenty-minute waiting period.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DIETARY_TEST_PANEL_SIZE_8_TO_10">Remedy/Remedy's protocol tests approximately 8–10 distinct compounds (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and attempted vitamin compounds) during intake/allergy screening.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CAN_PROVIDE_NUTRITIONALLY_COMPLETE_MEAL">Remedy can assemble a nutritionally-complete meal from synthesized fungal compounds; the first such meal produced for Kira provided approximately 800 calories and basic macro/micronutrients (with caveats about vitamin completeness and flavor).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_MEAL_PREPARATION_TIME_APPROX_45_MIN">Full meal synthesis/harvest/processing to produce an initial complete meal typically requires on the order of forty-five minutes once the compounds are approved/ready.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DIGESTIVE_TOLERANCE_CHECK_30_MIN">Post-meal digestive-tolerance monitoring is part of protocol: Remedy schedules a digestive-tolerance check roughly thirty minutes after the first full meal.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_INITIAL_MEAL_SCHEDULE_RECOMMENDATION">Facility recommends modest portions served three times daily initially (three times per day, modest portions until the body readjusts) as the feeding schedule following the intake/testing process.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The previous passage ends as the dietary assessment is being started (~17:40). The current passage picks up with the forms and then describes compound synthesis, sequential allergy testing ("small dose, wait twenty minutes" per compound), multiple compounds ("eight to ten"), growth times (first protein batch ready in 15 minutes), and a final meal synthesis time of ~45 minutes, then immediate eating. Summing plausible durations: initial paperwork and back-and-forth (≈15–30 min), first-batch growth (15 min), 8 compound tests × ~20 min each (≈160 min / 2 hr 40 min), plus some overhead and vitamin re-tests, then meal synthesis (45 min) and a short eating period (≈10–15 min). That yields a passage duration on the order of ~4 hours overall, consistent with Holloway’s earlier "approximately four hours" estimate. The narration also states "hours blurred together," supporting a multi-hour span. The passage ends after the meal is eaten and a 30-minute digestion-check is scheduled but not yet run, so the actual endpoint is immediately post-meal.</reasoning>
    <starts>17:40 (approx)</starts>
    <ends>21:40 (approx)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The previous passage ended with the decision to begin the dietary assessment, and this passage begins with filling those forms and launching the testing/synthesis workflow.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline matches explicit story cues (Holloway’s ~4-hour protocol) and the described tasks: paperwork, simultaneous growing of fungal batches, sequential 20-minute allergy/test windows for 8–10 compounds, and a 45-minute meal synthesis. The characters also parallelize some steps (forms continue while Remedy grows fungi), which helps fit the work into ~4 hours. Minor realism notes: clinical allergy testing sometimes requires longer observation or different protocols, and repeated ingestion/testing over many hours could be riskier in reality, but within the story’s advanced/alien medical tech and the small-dose protocol described, the timing is believable and consistent with the narrative.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Kira Voss, Holloway, Scout, Buddy, and Remedy all appear in the passage: Kira is the primary human subject, Holloway runs the dietary form via fruiting bodies, Scout is present and reacting, Buddy consults Kira's medical records, and Remedy (the robot) synthesizes and tests fungal compounds. No new characters arrive during the scene, and no characters that were present at the start leave before the passage ends. The scene occurs on an alien planet/medical chamber, which corresponds to the Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet entity provided.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage's important plot events concern the lengthy dietary assessment and the successful synthesis/testing of fungal-based nutrients that let Kira finally eat. I added items describing Holloway's paperwork, Buddy's nutritional data, Remedy's capabilities and limits (notably possible inability to make B12), the allergy-testing regimen (8–10 fungal compounds, sequential 20–30 minute tests), the hours-long process, and the final nutritionally complete ~800 kcal meal and immediate follow-up plan (three modest meals/day while readjusting). I consolidated previous bullets about Kira's waiting for approved food and daily bureaucratic care into a single updated entry reflecting that the assessment took hours and ended with food. I retained and slightly condensed ongoing, still-relevant facts (ship damage, SAM offline/Buddy active, Holloway/Remedy involvement, wound-healing timeline, limited emergency supplies) and flagged the potential long-term issue (B12 deficiency) as plot-relevant.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle experienced FTL drop-out and crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head bleeding, bruised ribs, and wounded right leg; primary ship AI SAM is offline and emergency neural-link AI 'Buddy' is active.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet has breathable atmosphere and freshwater ~800 m southwest; shuttle comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; emergency life-support reserves and limited survival supplies (sealed water, ~one week rations, basic med supplies, tools, tarp) remain.
      - Kira encountered the Holloway plant collective (scout sphere + vine/fruiting-plant network), was assigned temporary quarters and a Scout companion, and submitted to Holloway's bureaucratic care routines.
      - Remedy, a humanoid salvage/medic robot, examined Kira's leg, synthesized antibacterial fungal treatments that halted bacterial colonization, stabilized the wound, and recommended daily care for 4–5 more days then reduced frequency; estimated full healing ≈ two weeks.
      - Kira consented to Holloway's required dietary assessment; the assessment proved extensive and took many hours of testing rather than the originally estimated ~4 hours.
      - Holloway/Buddy compiled Kira's nutritional profile; Remedy can synthesize proteins, carbohydrates and some fats from local fungal/plant chemistry but cannot reliably produce certain micronutrients (notably vitamin B12 may be impossible), so some vitamins will be approximations.
      - Holloway/Remedy required allergy/sensitivity testing for novel fungal compounds: ~8–10 synthesized compounds were tested sequentially with small doses and 20–30 minute observation intervals, extending the process over several hours.
      - Remedy successfully grew and tested compounds (protein, carbohydrate, fat approved; at least one vitamin attempt rejected then a subsequent variant approved) and ultimately produced a nutritionally complete, ~800-calorie meal from fungal synthesis.
      - Kira ate the meal, tolerated it (digestive tolerance check scheduled in 30 minutes), regained strength and mental clarity; Holloway/Remedy established a plan of modest portions three times daily while her body readjusts.
      - Short-term survival needs are met by ongoing fungal nutrient synthesis and continuing wound care, but potential long-term micronutrient gaps (e.g., B12) were flagged as a future medical concern.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: The passage centers on Kira's acute physical desperation (intense hunger) filtered through rising exasperation at procedural bureaucracy. She's oscillating between resigned compliance and growing impatience as forms and tests pile up while her body literally weakens. When Remedy produces synthesized food and she finally eats, her tension collapses into visceral relief and cautious gratitude; there's also a small pragmatic acceptance that this imperfect solution will keep her alive. Reader: The reader likely feels empathetic impatience and mild irritation at the needless delays, edged with dark humor at the absurdity of alien bureaucracy administering dietary worksheets to a starving crash survivor. That tension converts to warm relief and satisfaction during the meal payoff. Multiple beats exist: primary frustration/dread around the paperwork and testing, a drawn-out anticipatory/tension phase during the timed allergy tests, and a culminating relief/hope beat when Kira is fed. Compared to the story so far, this continues an established emotional pattern (bureaucratic frustration → procedural delay → pragmatic rescue) seen in earlier scenes (orientation, intake, medical treatment). The recurrence is intentional and reinforcing rather than fatiguing: the bureaucratic absurdity is now balanced with a renewed wonder at Remedy's chemistry, which refreshes the pattern and shifts the tone toward practical hope rather than mere repetition.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="frustration">POV: Acute exasperation and indignation at Holloway's exhaustive dietary forms and the painfully slow, procedure-driven testing while Kira is starving; she answers on autopilot and grows resentful of the mismatch between urgent need and bureaucratic ritual. Reader: Feels impatient empathy and wry amusement at the absurdity—frustration is mixed with dark comedy because the scene recalls earlier procedural obstacles.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, tension">POV: A drawn-out, anxious waiting as each synthesized compound requires testing (twenty-minute windows) and Kira's hunger deepens into physical weakness; she oscillates between hope that the next test will succeed and fear that the delay will cost her. Reader: Experiences mounting suspense and bodily sympathy (the waits feel long and fraught), keyed by concrete time markers and sensory descriptions of her hollowing out.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, hope">POV: Deep, visceral relief and renewed cautious hope when Remedy completes synthesis and Kira finally eats—her body responds, shaking eases, and gratitude toward Remedy/Holloway/Scout settles in; pragmatic acceptance follows ('functional is good enough'). Reader: Feels warm release and satisfaction at the payoff, moved by the small but crucial victory and the humanizing caretaking despite ongoing imperfections.</beat>

    <reasoning>
      Summary of approach and choices:

      I compared the current passage to the prior open-promises list and marked which previously opened setups were demonstrated (paid off), which remain active, and which can be dropped. I treated concrete, procedural, or directly demonstrated setups as fulfilled; I kept unresolved mysteries, survival constraints, and ongoing uncertainties open; and I lapsed one older tentative setup that received no reinforcement. I also recorded new, ongoing commitments introduced by this passage (excluding anything introduced and fully resolved within the same passage). Notes on borderline cases: several infrastructure/AI items (Buddy, Holloway, Remedy, Scout) are explicitly active here, so I treated those previously-open AI/agent availability promises as paid off/confirmed rather than merely carried forward. The dietary assessment that Holloway estimated at ~4 hours was executed (forms + staged tests + meal synthesis), so I treated that prior promise as fulfilled even though exact timing flexed. The passage introduced a concrete, ongoing nutrition regime (synthesized meals + allergy-testing protocol) and a new medium-term risk (some vitamins like B12 may be impossible to synthesize), which I list as new open promises.

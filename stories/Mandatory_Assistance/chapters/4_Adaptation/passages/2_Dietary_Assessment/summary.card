  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>The passage ends immediately after Kira has been fed following a multi-hour dietary assessment and compound-allergy testing. Physically, she remains in the vine‑walled medical/quarters chamber where mushrooms have been actively fruiting and harvested. Remedy the robot is present and has been harvesting, processing, and combining fungal compounds into food; multiple mushroom varieties occupy the chamber in various growth stages and some have already been decomposed/recycled back into the facility network. Holloway's fruiting bodies and Buddy's systems remain online and documenting the assessment. A salvaged container that briefly held a nutritionally complete meal (≈800 kcal) has been emptied by Kira. All tested fungal compounds produced no immediate allergic reactions; one vitamin compound was rejected and another approved with reservations, and some vitamins (e.g., B12) remain uncertain/unavailable. Kira is physiologically stabilized by the meal (shaking eased, hunger abated), but exhausted; a digestive-tolerance check is scheduled in 30 minutes. Previously established wound care (bandaged, ~70% closed, daily care for several more days) and the water/spring feature remain in the environment but unchanged by these events. Documentation of the dietary assessment and a recommended meal schedule (three modest meals daily until readjustment) have been recorded by the facility.</reasoning>
    <state>Kira sits in her vine‑walled medical chamber, exhausted but recently fed; Scout the plant sphere remains at her side. Remedy the robot and Holloway’s fruiting bodies (and Buddy’s systems) are active and documenting. Dozens of mushroom clusters occupy the chamber—many harvested and some recycled into the living network—and Remedy has processed fungal compounds into a nutritionally complete meal (≈800 kcal) which Kira has eaten; the empty meal container remains. Allergy/allergy‑challenge testing of eight–ten synthesized compounds is complete with no acute reactions; one vitamin attempt was rejected and another approved with reservations; some vitamins (notably B12) may be unavailable. A digestive‑tolerance check is due in 30 minutes. Dietary assessment forms are completed and a three‑meals‑per‑day modest‑portion plan is recorded. The earlier wound remains bandaged and on its established care timeline (~70% closed, daily dressings for 4–5 more days); the spring-fed water basin and other living‑architecture features are present and unchanged. No other humans are present; the facility continues automated care and documentation.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage completes the immediate dietary-assessment arc started previously (forms → tests → first meal) and demonstrates the fungal/robotic system can synthesize edible, nutritionally-significant compounds — but it also creates new longer-term health and logistics questions (missing vitamins, sustainability, morale, time-costs). I marked as fulfilled the previous open promises that the passage actually paid off (dietary assessment/food access, and the fungal network's ability to produce nutrient compounds). Nothing from the prior open list was explicitly abandoned or dropped; most remain open and were reinforced by new detail. New promises introduced here are chiefly about limitations, ongoing commitments, and secondary consequences (B12/micronutrient risk, regular meal delivery, palatability/morale, testing/time-cost, digestive-adjustment monitoring).</reasoning>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I flagged only details from the passage that establish durable facts or procedures likely to matter later (nutritional capabilities, testing protocol, preparation time, Kira's stated dietary stance, Buddy's notes on Kira's consumption history). I did not repeat items already captured in the provided summary (meal ≈800 kcal, 8–10 compound tests, one vitamin rejected, digestive check in 30 minutes, three-meals/day plan, wound status, mushrooms/recycling, Remedy/Remedy competence, Buddy/plant behaviors, etc.). No statements in the passage contradict previously established facts, so I report no conflicts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="REMEDY_CAN_FRUIT_COMPLETE_PROTEINS">Remedy can fruit mushrooms engineered to provide complete amino-acid profiles (i.e., synthesize complete proteins via fungal cultivation).</fact>
      <fact id="REMEDY_SYNTHESIS_CAPABILITIES_OVERVIEW">Remedy assesses nutrient synthesis capability as: proteins possible via fungal fruiting, carbohydrates easy, some fats possible (fungal oils), but vitamins are challenging to produce accurately (some vitamin compounds may be impossible or only approximated).</fact>
      <fact id="ALLERGY_TESTING_PROTOCOL_20_MIN_WAIT">Allergy/allergen screening protocol used here: administer a small dose of a compound, wait ~20 minutes, and monitor for skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal reactions before approving the compound.</fact>
      <fact id="COMPOUND_TESTING_TIME_IMPLICATION">Testing multiple compounds (8–10) at ~20 minutes per compound imposes a multi-hour delay for establishing safe diet—an operational constraint for future planning.</fact>
      <fact id="FULL_MEAL_SYNTHESIS_TIME">After approval of compounds, full nutritionally complete meal synthesis/harvest/processing by Remedy requires roughly 45 minutes of active preparation.</fact>
      <fact id="NUTRITION_PROTOCOL_MODEST_FIRST_MEAL_AFTER_FAST">Per nutrition protocol, the first post-fasting meal should be a modest portion to avoid digestive distress after extended fasting (guides immediate portioning and pacing).</fact>
      <fact id="KIRA_DIETARY_RESTRICTIONS_NONE_WILL_EAT_ANYTHING">Kira explicitly reports no religious/cultural dietary restrictions and states she will eat 'literally anything edible'—a practical survival stance that affects future provisioning and consent for novel foods.</fact>
      <fact id="BUDDY_REPORTED_CONSUMPTION_HISTORY">Buddy's dietary/consumption history for Kira (from medical records) includes a preference for protein-rich meals, minimal processed sugars, occasional chocolate as a treat, and moderate spice tolerance.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately where the previous one left off: Kira had just agreed to begin the dietary assessment and the narrative opens with the forms being administered. Time cues: mentions of a standard ~four-hour dietary assessment in the previous passage, Remedy growing the first test batch in ~15 minutes, allergy tests taking ~20 minutes each, testing of 8–10 compounds, and a ~45-minute meal synthesis. The passage therefore covers multiple hours of activity (forms, sequential allergy testing, then meal synthesis and eating) and ends once the nutritionally complete meal is produced and Kira has eaten. Since the previous passage ended with the decision to start assessment, essentially no gap separates the two scenes—the current passage is the assessment sequence itself. The internal timing is consistent with the explicit cues: 8–10 tests at ~20 minutes each is about 2.7–3.3 hours, plus the initial forms/record review (~30–60 minutes referenced earlier as part of the ~4 hr protocol), plus ~45 minutes for full meal preparation. Total elapsed during the passage is therefore on the order of ~4–5 hours. This fits the earlier statement that the dietary assessment is roughly four hours and explains the added time for meal synthesis. Plausibility: The timeline is plausible within the story’s technology—immediate fruiting networks and robotic synthesis justify the rapid generation of test samples and a full meal within several hours. In real-world terms, sequential allergy screening (20 minutes per test) and observation windows do add up to multiple hours; the robot’s rapid synthesis is speculative but internally consistent. The only small note is that the assessment runs slightly longer than the quoted four-hour standard once full meal synthesis is included, but that overrun is explicitly accounted for in the text and well within believable variation.</reasoning>
    <starts>~17:20</starts>
    <ends>~22:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — the passage continues immediately from the previous scene (the dietary assessment begins right after Kira agreed to it).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Sequential allergy tests (20 min each for 8–10 compounds) plus forms and a ~45-minute meal synthesis reasonably total ~4–5 hours, matching the passage’s cues. The rapid fungal growth and robotic processing are speculative tech but consistent with the story’s established world, so the timing works. The assessment slightly exceeds the quoted four-hour standard once meal prep is included, but that overrun is noted in the narrative and believable.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>The passage explicitly includes Kira Voss, Holloway, Scout, Buddy, and Remedy: Kira is the person being assessed and eating; Holloway conducts the dietary form; Buddy accesses medical records and comments; Scout stays with Kira; Remedy (the robot) synthesizes and tests fungal compounds. No other named characters from the available list are mentioned. The previous-present list shows those five were already present at the end of the prior passage, so no new characters enter during this scene and none are shown to exit before the scene ends. The setting is an alien planet, corresponding to /world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

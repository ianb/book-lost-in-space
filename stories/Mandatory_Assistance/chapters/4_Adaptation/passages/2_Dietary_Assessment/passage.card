  <reasoning-passage>
    Dietary assessment as COMEDY, not frustration. Kira finds the cultural preferences questions HILARIOUS. Buddy fascinated by nutrition science. Watching Remedy work is interesting. When food comes - she's laughing about mushroom paste, not desperate. "This is the weirdest meal I've ever had. And I love it."

    The dietary assessment forms are extensive.

    "Section One: Basic Nutritional Requirements," Holloway announces via fruiting bodies around the medical chamber. "Daily caloric intake range?"

    My stomach growls but I'm grinning. "Approximately two thousand calories per day. For baseline maintenance."

    "Excellent! Macronutrient ratios?"

    "Balanced? Carbohydrates, proteins, fats. The usual human stuff."

    "Could you be more specific?"

    "I'm a cargo specialist, not a nutritionist. Buddy, help?"

    "Accessing records now!" Buddy sounds excited. "Kira's optimal nutritional profile includes complete proteins with essential amino acids, complex carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, and a comprehensive vitamin and mineral panel. Shall I list each micronutrient requirement?"

    "Please do!" Holloway sounds delighted.

    This is going to be fascinating.

    Mushrooms are fruiting throughout the chamber—Remedy's network responding to the discussion. The robot stands to one side, observing.

    "While we document requirements," Remedy says, "I'm analyzing which compounds I can synthesize from available plant chemistry. Proteins are possible—I can fruit mushrooms with complete amino acid profiles. Carbohydrates, easy. Some fats. Vitamins will be... challenging."

    "How do you decide which mushrooms to grow?" Buddy asks, fascinated.

    "Each variety produces different compounds! I match the compounds to her nutritional profile."

    "That's so cool," Buddy says.

    I agree. Watching Remedy figure out human nutrition is actually interesting.

    "Section Two: Dietary Restrictions," Holloway continues. "Do you follow any religious or cultural dietary guidelines?"

    I start laughing. Can't help it.

    "Are you okay?" Buddy asks.

    "Cultural dietary guidelines," I say, still laughing. "I crashed on an alien planet and they're asking if I keep kosher."

    "Dietary preferences are very important for individual wellness!" Holloway sounds a bit confused by my reaction.

    "No, no, I love it. It's perfect." I'm grinning. "No religious restrictions. No cultural requirements. I'm a 'will eat literally anything edible' kind of person."

    "Wonderful! Very flexible dietary parameters." Holloway sounds pleased. "Next: favorite cuisines or flavor profiles?"

    "Favorite cuisines! While I haven't eaten in thirty-six hours!" I'm still laughing. "This is AMAZING. Okay—favorite cuisine is 'food.' Any food. All food."

    Buddy provides data: "Kira's consumption history suggests preference for protein-rich meals, minimal processed sugars, occasional chocolate as treat food. Spice tolerance: moderate."

    "Excellent data! Section Three: Allergies and Sensitivities."

    At least this section is relevant.

    I list what I know—mild lactose intolerance, no others documented. Buddy provides medical file specifics. Remedy's robot takes notes.

    "Good news," Remedy says. "None of your allergens exist in plant chemistry here. Bad news: I have no idea if you'll react to novel fungal proteins. We'll need to test each compound."

    "Test how?"

    "Small dose, wait twenty minutes, check for reaction. Standard allergy protocol."

    "How many compounds?"

    "Eight to ten. Covering proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and what vitamins I can synthesize."

    "Can we start testing while finishing the assessment?" I suggest. "To optimize the timeline?"

    "Excellent process improvement suggestion!" Holloway says.

    "Already growing the first batch." Mushrooms are fruiting rapidly in the corner. "Protein compound alpha. Ready in fifteen minutes."

    The forms continue. Section Four: Texture Preferences. Section Five: Temperature Preferences. Section Six: Meal Frequency Requirements.

    I answer while watching mushrooms grow. Remedy's chemistry is fascinating—different varieties for different compounds, each specifically engineered for particular nutrients.

    "What's that purple one do?" Buddy asks.

    "Fatty acid synthesis! Essential for brain function."

    "First test ready," Remedy announces. "Protein alpha—complete amino acid profile, derived from oyster mushroom variant."

    The robot offers a tiny amount of grayish paste on a salvaged spoon.

    I eat it. Bland. Slightly earthy. Texture like ground meat that gave up on life.

    But *food*.

    "Now we wait twenty minutes," Remedy says.

    The testing process becomes almost meditative. Small sample. Wait. Watch. Buddy asks questions about each compound. Remedy explains enthusiastically. I'm hungry but genuinely interested.

    Carbohydrate compound—mushroom sugars and starches. Approved.
    Fat compound—fungal oils. Approved.
    Vitamin complex attempt one. Bitter. Rejected.
    Vitamin complex attempt two. Less bitter. Approved with reservations.

    Finally: "All compounds tested and approved. Ready for full meal synthesis."

    "Meal preparation will take approximately forty-five minutes," Holloway adds.

    I watch Remedy work—robot moving between mushroom clusters, harvesting, processing, combining compounds. The mushrooms decompose back into the network after harvest. Efficient and kind of beautiful.

    Finally, the robot approaches with a container.

    "Nutritionally complete meal," Remedy announces. "Protein, carbohydrates, fats, approximate vitamins. Total: about eight hundred calories. Not optimized for flavor—couldn't spare the compounds for taste enhancement. But it's food. It won't kill you."

    The container holds grayish-brown paste mixed with chunks of processed mushroom. It looks like institutional food that lost a fight with despair.

    I grin. "My first alien meal."

    I eat.

    It tastes like mushroom paste mixed with cardboard, flavored with existential ennui and a hint of earth. The texture is somewhere between wallpaper paste and failed protein bars.

    And I laugh while eating it.

    "This is the weirdest meal I've ever had," I say between bites. "Mushroom paste on an alien planet. Made by a robot. While filling out cultural dietary preference forms."

    My body recognizes *food*—actual nutrition entering my system. The hollowness begins to fill. The shaking eases.

    Scout bounces happily.

    "Is it good?" Buddy asks.

    "It's TERRIBLE. And I love it." I'm grinning through the bad taste. "Best alien food I've ever had!"

    "Digestive tolerance check in thirty minutes," Remedy says. "Then regular meal schedule. Three times daily."

    I finish the container. Not desperate—well, a little desperate—but mostly just amused by the absurdity.

    "Thank you," I say. To Remedy, to Holloway, to Scout. "Seriously. This is amazing."

    "Chemistry works," Remedy says simply.

    One more impossible thing adapted to. One more absurd requirement navigated. Through forms, through testing, through mushroom paste that tastes like cardboard.

    But also: through laughter. Through curiosity. Through genuinely wonderful weirdness.

    This is my life now. And it's actually kind of great.

  <summary>
    Kira undergoes dietary assessment while hungry—and finds it HILARIOUS. Cultural dietary preference forms! Religious restrictions! Remedy synthesizes mushroom-based compounds while Buddy asks fascinated questions about the chemistry. Each compound tested for allergies—hours pass but Kira is genuinely interested in the process. Finally receives gray mushroom paste that tastes terrible. She eats it while laughing: "This is the weirdest meal I've ever had. And I love it." Basic food system established through absurdity embraced.

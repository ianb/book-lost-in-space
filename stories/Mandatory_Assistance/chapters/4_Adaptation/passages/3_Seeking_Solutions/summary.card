  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage advances several durable story points that will matter later: Voss has formally escalated her situation to the plants’ highest authority (Elder Heartwood) and the plants have acknowledged and transmitted an exception query; Holloway/Elder Heartwood operate on multi-week to multi-month timescales; daily wellness checks and ongoing bureaucratic intake are now part of Voss’s routine; and Buddy provides a new, much longer rescue estimate. The most important continuity issue is that Buddy’s new 12–18 month estimate directly contradicts an earlier established Buddy estimate of a minimum three-week rescue timeline. I do not record transient details (e.g., Voss lying on the bed, Scout’s comforting behavior) or things already in the provided summary.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_QUERY_FILED_WITH_ELDER_HEARTWOOD">Kira Voss (with Holloway’s help) has filed a formal exception query requesting Elder Heartwood’s guidance/assistance (including petitioner information, nature of exception, requested guidance, and supporting documentation).</fact>
      <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_EXISTS_AND_HANDLES_EXCEPTIONS">Elder Heartwood is an acknowledged plant authority/entity that handles complex or exceptional cases that don't fit standard protocols (the collective consults them for rare situations).</fact>
      <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_SLOW_DISTANT_COMMUNICATION">Elder Heartwood is geographically distant and operates on very slow temporal scales (thought processes and responses take weeks to months; communication is challenging).</fact>
      <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_ESTIMATE_8_TO_12_WEEKS">Holloway expects Elder Heartwood’s response to the filed query in roughly eight to twelve weeks (stated as the transmission/response timeline for this exception request).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DAILY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_SCHEDULED">Holloway schedules regular (daily) wellness checks for Kira, beginning the following morning (wellness checks are now part of Voss’s ongoing care routine).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_QUERY_FORM_FIELDS_DOCUMENTED">The formal exception query includes documented fields: petitioner information (name, arrival, status), nature of exception, requested guidance (long-term survival, contact/transport options), and supporting documentation (medical records, crash site location, resource needs).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_RESCUE_ESTIMATE_12_TO_18_MONTHS">Buddy reports an updated realistic rescue timeline of approximately twelve to eighteen months (minimum), adding the caveat 'if they search at all.'</fact>

      <conflict id="RESCUE_TIMELINE_CONFLICT" with-fact="CHANGE_RESCUE_TIMELINE_MINIMUM_THREE_WEEKS">Previously Buddy estimated a minimum rescue timeline of about three weeks (best-case). In this passage Buddy reports a much longer estimate of twelve to eighteen months (minimum), which directly contradicts the earlier established rescue timeline estimate.</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the passage: the immediate context continues from the meal scene (Remedy's digestive-tolerance protocol and the completed meal). The passage explicitly says “Over the next hour, Holloway guides me through the formal query process,” and later “Later, lying on the soft moss… Three days since the crash.” There is also earlier mention in the previous passage of a 30-minute digestive-tolerance wait and a 45-minute meal-preparation interval; those can reasonably be folded into the short transition between passages.

      Start cues: the narrator is sitting in quarters after the mushroom meal, reflecting for the first time since the crash. That places the start immediately after the previous scene’s meal/monitoring. The previous-passage end time is given as ~21:40; the current passage begins within minutes of that.

      Duration cues: the passage contains an explicit "over the next hour" block for filling and filing the query. After that hour the narrator lies down and reflects; no further long-duration events occur in this passage. The scene is still the same evening (same day three days after the crash), so the passage spans roughly an hour to an hour-and-a-half.

      End cue: the narrator lies down and goes to sleep/close eyes after scheduling the next wellness check and reflecting. That marks the passage end the same night.

      Plausibility notes: The small transition time (finishing meal, walking to quarters, brief monitoring) followed by a one-hour documentation session is reasonable. The plant-society response-times given (Elder Heartwood reply in 8–12 weeks) are worldbuilding claims and do not conflict with the immediate timeline. The only minor ambiguity is whether the 30-minute digestive-tolerance monitoring occurs before or during the “over the next hour” paperwork; narratively it is plausible to fold that waiting period into the hour used to complete the query. Overall the timing is plausible.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>~21:45</starts>
    <ends>~23:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>Approximately none — immediate continuation. Likely a short 5–20 minute transition after the meal (finishing eating, brief monitoring, moving back to quarters) before the narration begins.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The explicit one-hour documentation period fits the text’s “over the next hour” statement, and a short transition after the meal/monitoring is reasonable. No obvious contradictions with prior timing (the 30-minute tolerance check can reasonably overlap with the hour of paperwork). The longer response-times (weeks/months) mentioned for Elder Heartwood are narrative/worldbuilding and don’t conflict with the scene’s immediate timeline.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters appearing in the passage: Kira (first-person narrator) is present throughout. Scout is explicitly settled nearby and present at the start. Buddy is addressed and replies with rescue-timeline data, so is present. Holloway sprouted a fruiting body near the entrance and speaks — that indicates Holloway 'arrives' during the scene. Elder Heartwood is repeatedly mentioned as the authority being queried, so they are included though they do not physically appear. No character is described leaving before the passage ends. The only relevant entity from the provided list is the planet (the scene describes being stranded on an alien/uncharted planet).</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage establishes two key developments that affect future plot options: (1) Buddy's realistic rescue estimate (12–18 months minimum) which makes self-sufficiency/reliance on local resources the likely near-term reality; (2) Holloway filed a formal exception query to Elder Heartwood (the collective's slow, high-authority problem-solver) on Kira's behalf, with an estimated response time of ~8–12 weeks. I consolidated earlier, overly granular medical/nutrition testing details into concise statements about wound stabilization, fungal-synthesized food established, and a flagged long-term micronutrient concern (B12). I kept facts that remain relevant to survival and possible escape (ship losses, SAM offline, Buddy active, supplies, water availability, Remedy care, Holloway integration, Scout companion, daily wellness checks), removed minutiae (exact number/timing of compound tests, step-by-step form fields), and ordered bullets chronologically.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle suffered FTL drop-out and crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head bleeding, bruised ribs, and wounded right leg; primary ship AI SAM is offline and emergency neural-link AI 'Buddy' is active.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet has breathable atmosphere and freshwater ~800 m southwest; shuttle comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; emergency life-support reserves and limited survival supplies remain (sealed water, ~one week rations, basic med supplies, tools, tarp).
      - Kira encountered the Holloway plant collective (scout sphere + vine/fruiting-plant network), was given temporary quarters and a Scout companion, and entered Holloway's bureaucratic care routines.
      - Remedy, a salvage/medic robot, examined and treated Kira's leg, halted bacterial colonization, stabilized the wound, and advised ongoing daily care with full healing estimated ~two weeks.
      - Holloway/Remedy ran an extensive nutritional assessment and allergy testing, then synthesized fungal-derived meals that provide basic macronutrients; short-term food and rations established but a potential long-term micronutrient gap (notably B12) was flagged.
      - Kira has begun adapting to Holloway's procedures and language, attending wellness checks and following care protocols; Scout remains a constant nonverbal companion and guardian.
      - Buddy estimates realistic rescue/search reach at this location would be a minimum of 12–18 months (if rescue/search is initiated at all).
      - Kira asked Holloway for higher-level assistance; Holloway identified Elder Heartwood (an ancient, slow-acting authority that handles exceptional cases) and filed a formal exception query on Kira's behalf.
      - The query to Elder Heartwood was transmitted with an estimated response time of ~8–12 weeks (two to three months); Holloway will continue daily wellness checks and support while awaiting guidance.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV feelings: The protagonist oscillates between sober dread and pragmatic acceptance, then shifts into a cautious, sustaining hope. She faces the cold math of rescue timelines (twelve to eighteen months) and feels the weight of likely long-term stranding—this produces low, steady dread and resigned realism. When Holloway offers Elder Heartwood as an exceptional authority and the query is filed, a bright, desperate hope flares: not immediate salvation, but a real, actionable route. By the end she settles into determined acceptance and resilient patience, framing the months of forms and wellness checks as a strategy rather than surrender. Reader experience: Readers share the character's jolt of bleakness at the rescue odds (tightening worry), then feel relief and uplift when an authority and a concrete process appear, and finally a gentle reassurance mixed with lingering anxiety as Kira commits to survival rhythms. Multiple beats: there are clearly multiple emotional beats — an initial dread/acceptance, a hopeful/anticipatory turn when Elder Heartwood is invoked and the query is filed, and a settling into sustained acceptance/resilience. Comparison to prior pattern: This continues the story's established cycle (anticipation → dread → acceptance) but shifts the timescale from acute crisis to long-term endurance. The comedic/bureaucratic tone that has recurred (forms, protocols) remains present and now becomes part of Kira's survival strategy rather than merely an obstacle. Emotional energy is steadier and more reflective here, moving from immediate danger to procedural, patient hope and pragmatic grit.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="dread, acceptance">POV: A cold, pragmatic dread when Kira learns the realistic rescue timeline (12–18 months) and accepts that rescue is unlikely or severely delayed; this is coupled with clipped acceptance ('the math isn't good') as she inventories survival basics. Cause: concrete timeline data and the isolation of an uncharted planet. Reader: tightens with anxiety and sympathetic resignation — a heavier, longer-term fear than prior acute danger.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, anticipation">POV: A sudden, bright hope when Holloway names Elder Heartwood and offers to file an official query; filing the petition produces anticipatory optimism (eight–twelve weeks response). Cause: discovery of an actual authority who handles exceptions and the tangible act of initiating contact. Reader: experiences relief and renewed curiosity — a lift from despair into invested anticipation about whether the plants' slow wisdom will produce help.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Quiet, determined acceptance as Kira integrates bureaucratic life into a survival strategy—scheduling wellness checks, enduring forms, and reframing patience as action. The hope here is steady and pragmatic rather than ecstatic. Cause: filing the query, Scout's companionship, and the small proof that she can work the system. Reader: feels calming reassurance and respect for Kira's agency, paired with lingering concern about the long wait.</beat>
    </beats>
  </emotional-journey>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage shifts focus from immediate survival logistics (food, wound care) to medium-term institutional routes for help: Kira files a formal exception query with the plant collective and is told Elder Heartwood (an ancient authority) can respond in months. That action uses the plants' bureaucratic emergency channels, so the plants-as-contact mechanism has been executed. The passage also supplies a new, grim estimate for external rescue (12–18 months) that contradicts an earlier optimistic 3-week estimate, so the short rescue timeline lapses. Immediate life-support urgency (48-hour) is no longer the pressing constraint—basic water, shelter, food, and wound care have been established—so that specific emergency window lapses. Many prior threads (navigation mystery, shuttle damage, SAM fate, vitamin/B12 risk, ongoing allergy testing, Remedy's wound care timeline, maintained/organized environment, etc.) are neither resolved nor contradicted and therefore remain open. Two clear new narrative set-ups arise: the explicit existence/role of Elder Heartwood as an exceptional authority (and the fact that a query has been filed and a response is pending on an 8–12 week timescale), and an explicit, updated rescue-timeline expectation (12–18 months) that reframes Kira's likely timeframe for being rescued. These new elements will anchor medium-term plot expectations (months of bureaucratic waiting, potential authority intervention) while preserving many unresolved mysteries about the crash and environment.</reasoning>

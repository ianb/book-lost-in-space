      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>Kira is physically in her personal quarters/medical chamber, awake and recently fed. Scout (the small plant-sphere companion) is physically present nearby, alternating between beside Kira and the entrance as described. Holloway is embodied in fruiting bodies near the entrance and remains active; Buddy’s systems are online and provided records; the fungal synthesis capability that produced the meal is still present in the facility (mushroom clusters and processed compounds were recently harvested). Kira has finished the ~800 kcal fungal meal (the empty container remains), feels physically stabilized, and shows no acute allergic or digestive reaction noted in the passage. Her wound is still in the healing process (previously bandaged and improving). Water and shelter remain functional. A formal exception/query document requesting Elder Heartwood’s guidance has been completed and transmitted through the plant network to Elder Heartwood’s grove; the network records an expected response timeline of about eight to twelve weeks (Holloway’s estimate). Rescue by human authorities is assessed as unlikely in the short term (Buddy’s projection: ~12–18 months minimum, if at all). Routine care has been scheduled: a wellness check is set for the next morning and daily checks will continue. The living architecture (springs, bioluminescent ceiling, moss/woven-fiber bed) remains intact and in use. No other humans are present; the facility’s automated/documentation systems are active and continuing to monitor and log Kira’s status.</reasoning>
        <state>Kira is in her quarters/medical chamber on day three post-crash, lying on a moss-and-woven-fiber bed under a bioluminescent ceiling, recently fed on the synthesized fungal meal (empty container present). Scout is beside her / near the entrance. Holloway’s fruiting bodies and Buddy’s systems are active and documenting; the fungal cultivation/processing infrastructure remains in the chamber (many clusters recently harvested and recycled). Remedy’s earlier synthesized compounds have been tested with no acute reactions; vitamins remain partially approximated (some, like B12, likely unavailable). Kira’s wound is healing; water and shelter remain functional. A formal exception query to Elder Heartwood has been filed and transmitted via the plant network (response estimated in ~8–12 weeks); Buddy estimates external human rescue would take roughly 12–18 months if initiated. A wellness check is scheduled for the next morning and daily monitoring/records continue. No other humans are present; automated care systems remain operational.</state>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I treated this passage as primarily procedural/settling — Kira consolidates immediate survival (food, wound care, shelter, water) and initiates a formal exception request to an introduced authority (Elder Heartwood). I looked for prior open promises that the passage explicitly resolved (paid off), those it implicitly abandoned, and new setups the passage creates. Result: the scene does not conclusively resolve any of the prior, longer-term open promises (most remain open). It does, however, introduce concrete new narrative beats to track: a filed query to Elder Heartwood (with an 8–12 week response estimate), Buddy's rescue-time estimate (12–18 months) and the explicit possibility that no rescue may come, and an institutionalized cadence of wellness/monitoring and ongoing pressure to 'integrate' into plant governance. I therefore carried most previous promises forward (they remain relevant/unresolved), left none marked as fully fulfilled or lapsed, and added new promises introduced here (Elder Heartwood query, rescue timeline estimate, scheduled wellness checks, and the durable risk of integration/long-term isolation).</reasoning>

          <promise id="RESCUE_TIMELINE_ESTIMATE_FROM_BUDDY">(New) Buddy provides a rescue estimate: 12–18 months minimum if search is initiated, with a strong caveat about detection and whether a search will occur — establishes long-term isolation as likely.</promise>
          <promise id="RESCUE_PROBABILITY_LOW__POSSIBLE_NO_SEARCH">(New) Buddy explicitly notes rescue is uncertain (‘if they search at all’), introducing the real possibility of no rescue and thus long-term self-reliance or permanent stranding.</promise>
          <promise id="WELLNESS_CHECKS_SCHEDULED">(New/confirmed) Holloway schedules daily/regular wellness checks (next one tomorrow) — establishes an institutional monitoring cadence that will shape Kira’s daily life and dependence on the facility.</promise>
          <promise id="BUREAUCRATIC_INTEGRATION_PRESSURE">(New/strengthened) Holloway’s praise of Kira’s adaptation and repeated reference to 'integration' make the risk of social assimilation or obligations more immediate and trackable.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I reviewed the passage for significant, long-term facts that would matter in future scenes (character roles, institutional details, timing expectations, and state changes). I excluded transient details already captured in the provided summary (day count, presence of Scout, query filed and transmitted, wellness checks, Buddy's 12–18 month estimate, healing/food/water status, partial vitamin limitations, etc.). The facts I list below add durable context: the Meridian likely went off-route/experienced an FTL problem, a quantified baseline search-speed estimate Buddy gives (6–8 months) separate from the final 12–18 month projection, documentary fields used in the plant exception query, characteristics of Elder Heartwood (old/slow-time/geographically distant), and Scout’s role as a steady nonverbal guardian/companion. I found no contradictions with previously established facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="MERIDIAN_WENT_DOWN_OFF_ROUTE">The Meridian went down off-course/in a location 'we weren't supposed to be' (implying the ship was off-route when it crashed).</fact>
          <fact id="MERIDIAN_FTL_MALFUNCTION_SUSPECTED">An FTL malfunction (or similar catastrophic navigation failure) is suspected as the cause of the Meridian's loss of route and crash.</fact>
          <fact id="MERIDIAN_LOCATION_UNCHARTED_OUTER_REACHES">The crash occurred in an uncharted sector of the Outer Reaches, far from trade routes, making detection and rescue more difficult.</fact>
          <fact id="RESCUE_SEARCH_RADIUS_BASELINE_6_8_MONTHS">Buddy states that, if rescue operations were initiated immediately, the search radius would take approximately six to eight months to reach this system (a baseline search-speed estimate distinct from the adjusted 12–18 month probability estimate).</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_IS_OLDEST_AND_THINKS_IN_SLOW_TIME">Elder Heartwood is described as the oldest plant authority whose growth/decision cycles operate on 'slow time'—growth measured in seasons and thought processes taking days or weeks.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_GEOGRAPHICALLY_DISTANT">Elder Heartwood is geographically distant from Holloway; direct communication is possible but delayed by physical separation and slow deliberation.</fact>
          <fact id="PLANT_EXCEPTION_QUERY_FIELDS">The plant community's formal exception query includes these documented fields: Petitioner Information (name, arrival circumstances, current status); Nature of Exception (description of stranded non-plant lifeform needing exceptional assistance); Requested Guidance (long-term survival, contact/transport options); Supporting Documentation (medical records, crash site location, resource needs, adaptation challenges).</fact>
          <fact id="SCOUT_ROLE_CONSTANT_NONVERBAL_GUARDIAN">Scout serves as a constant, nonverbal companion/guardian for Kira—present at crises and during daily routines, offering comfort and attentive presence.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Cues in the text: the passage opens immediately after Kira has eaten ("The mushroom paste sits heavy in my stomach") and shortly after Remedy/Holloway's post-meal remarks in the previous passage (digestive-tolerance check, scheduling). The passage explicitly contains an "Over the next hour, Holloway guides me through the formal query process," plus several short exchanges (filing the query, transmission announcement, scheduling a wellness check, moving to quarters, settling on the bed and reflecting). The narrator also gives a broader anchor: "Three days since the crash," which is a multi-day count rather than a clock time. Taken together, the passage covers the hour-long formal query plus additional minutes for the surrounding actions (moving to quarters, short conversation, lying down and reflecting). That yields a passage duration of roughly 1–1.5 hours. The previous passage ended at ~22:00. The start of this passage is soon after the meal/digestive period — plausibly ~30 minutes after the previous passage end — and then continues for about an hour (the explicit hour of form-filling) plus some minutes to get to bed. So the passage likely starts late evening and ends later that night. 

          Time accounting: the thirty-minute digestive-tolerance wait from the previous passage is compatible with the narrator being able to finish eating and then begin the one-hour query process; the hour is explicitly stated. The remaining small actions (moving to quarters, scheduling, lying down) add roughly 15–30 minutes. Overall timing is plausible and internally consistent with the previous scene. No major timing contradictions are present (the 30-minute wait and the subsequent hour of forms fit together), and the ‘‘three days since the crash’’ note is a separate, coarser temporal anchor that does not conflict with the late-evening chronology.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>~22:30</starts>
        <ends>~23:30</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~30 minutes. The previous passage ends with Kira having just eaten and a 30-minute digestive-tolerance window; this passage begins after that immediate post-meal period. During the gap she moves to her quarters and begins the formal query process with Holloway (consistent with the narrative).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The passage explicitly contains an hour of form-filling and several short actions before and after, which together fit into ~1–1.5 hours after the end of the previous scene. The 30-minute digestive check mentioned previously meshes with starting the hour of paperwork afterward. The only minor ambiguity is exact minute counts for moving/settling, but that does not create a contradiction—overall pacing and sequence of events are reasonable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Kira Voss is the first-person narrator and appears throughout. Scout and Buddy are physically present and interact in the scene. Holloway (the fruiting body) speaks, guides the paperwork, and transmits the query. Elder Heartwood is mentioned repeatedly as the authority being contacted (appearance by reference). No new characters enter during this passage, and no characters who were present at the start explicitly leave during the passage. The scene takes place on an alien planet, so /world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet is relevant.</reasoning>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts are those that change Kira's status or add persistent world/character details likely to matter later (who coordinates orientation, that Kira completed orientation and was cleared for medical evaluation, the assessment parameters, and the mobility/tech style of the plants). I omitted transient or scene-level details (Scout’s immediate actions, Kira’s momentary pain, line-by-line quiz content beyond the assessment parameters) and details already captured in prior facts (e.g., that the facility is living, that plants produce bark documentation). No genuine contradictions with prior established facts were found — the passage elaborates on the orientation process and confirms that completing orientation clears Kira for medical evaluation, which aligns with previously recorded requirements and facility behavior.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="FLORENCE_ROLE_ORIENTATION_COORDINATOR">A plant entity named Florence serves as the facility's workplace-safety/orientation coordinator and conducts the onboarding presentation.</fact>
      <fact id="FLORENCE_MOBILITY_PLATFORM_THREE_WHEELS">Florence operates from a wheeled mobility platform with three wheels (stable tripod arrangement) built from salvaged materials and controlled via delicate tendrils manipulating a joystick.</fact>
      <fact id="ORIENTATION_CHAMBER_CLASSROOM_LAYOUT">The facility includes an orientation chamber larger than the intake room with vine-formed seats facing a flat presentation surface and bioluminescent patches providing steady light (a classroom-like space for onboarding).</fact>
      <fact id="ORIENTATION_ASSESSMENT_20Q_20MIN_PASS70">The orientation includes a formal assessment: a 20-question multiple-choice quiz with a 20-minute time limit and a passing score set at 70%.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_ORIENTATION_SCORE_90">Kira Voss scored 18 out of 20 (90%) on the orientation assessment.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues in the previous passage establish that orientation begins immediately after intake and that the facility's “standard protocol is four hours for workplace safety fundamentals.” The current passage is the orientation itself: it opens with Kira in the orientation chamber and follows the full training, including a multi-topic presentation and a 20-minute assessment. The passage ends when Florence declares the orientation complete and Kira is cleared for medical evaluation. Therefore the passage covers the orientation block — roughly the four-hour period already mentioned. There is no separate intervening gap between passages; this passage is the continuation of the sequence that ended with “Four hours to go.” The only short, implied actions between the two passages are moving from the intake room to the orientation chamber and seating, which are effectively instantaneous in narrative terms. Evidence: explicit line “Standard protocol is four hours for workplace safety fundamentals!”; quiz length “You’ll have twenty minutes”; closing line, “You’ve successfully completed orientation. You’re now cleared for medical evaluation!”</reasoning>
    <starts>~01:50 post-crash</starts>
    <ends>~05:50 post-crash</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — this passage continues immediately from the previous. The only minimal actions between passages were walking into the orientation chamber and sitting down. The passage itself covers the roughly four-hour orientation period (presentation + 20-minute quiz).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible overall. The passage explicitly uses the facility’s four-hour orientation protocol, so placing ~4 hours of training here is consistent with prior text. The 20-minute quiz fits within that block. Minor realism notes: completing a four-hour training while injured and exhausted is uncomfortable but narratively justified by Kira’s need to proceed and the facility’s insistence; Remedy’s temporary treatment (stated earlier to be effective for six to eight hours) makes delaying medical evaluation for ~4 hours defensible. No major timing contradictions are present, though the amount of content compressed into the narrative is condensed for pacing (expected in scenes summarizing long procedures).</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters appearing in the passage: Kira Voss (narrator/protagonist) is present throughout. Scout is present from the start (bounces to a seat) and later moves toward a doorway; this indicates Scout leaves the chamber during the scene. Buddy speaks and comments multiple times, so Buddy is present. Holloway's voice and actions (reviewing answers) appear, so Holloway is present. Florence is described as a plant that "entered the chamber on a wheeled platform," then speaks and runs the orientation; Florence therefore enters during this passage (was not listed among previously present characters). No other available characters are mentioned. The facility/planet setting is an alien planet where Kira crashed; the available entity that corresponds is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet. No other entities from the provided list are relevant. Remedy was present at the end of the previous passage but is not mentioned in this passage, so Remedy is not included in PRESENT. EXITED includes Scout because she moves toward another doorway (leaving the orientation chamber before the passage ends); no other character is explicitly described as leaving before the passage ends.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage completes the previously-scheduled orientation: a new plant coordinator (Florence) led a workplace-safety style onboarding that Kira endures despite its absurdity. Key new facts to record are Florence's arrival, the content and tone of the training (workplace safety, evacuation, harassment, ergonomics, documentation), Buddy's running commentary, Kira's exhaustion/pain during the session, the quiz/assessment, Kira's score (18/20, 90%), and that she is now cleared for medical evaluation and being escorted deeper into the facility. I removed the prior bullet that the orientation was merely scheduled for four hours and replaced it with the completed orientation and outcome. I kept earlier high-level facts about the crash, SAM offline/Buddy active, environment, supplies, plant collective, Remedy's treatment and its 6–8 hour effectiveness because they remain relevant to Kira's immediate medical/time constraints.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out killed Jensen and Reed; Kira Voss (cargo specialist) survived with head bleeding, bruised ribs, and a wounded right leg.
      - Primary ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI 'Buddy' (childlike persona) activated and is assisting Kira with scans, guidance, and ship-record recovery.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet has breathable Earth-like atmosphere and freshwater ~800 m southwest; shuttle life support on emergency reserves (~48 hours); comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged.
      - Surviving shuttle supplies include sealed water containers, roughly a week of rations, basic medical supplies, tools, a tarp, and a powered but locked temperature-controlled 'Biological Samples' container.
      - Kira left the shuttle, encountered mobile plant life: a small Scout sphere and larger coordinated rolling plants that speak human Standard and use workplace/HR phrasing; the collective identifies as 'Holloway.'
      - Plants said a previous human visitor died and that they learned human language/procedures from that visitor's materials; a plant named 'Remedy' provided antibacterial wound care that is estimated to remain effective ~6–8 hours.
      - The plants escorted Kira to their central woven-vine facility for intake; Holloway performed formal intake with carved bark-forms while Buddy provided surviving ship records; Kira reported no reachable emergency contacts and declined Buddy as contact; Holloway offered the plant collective as emergency contact.
      - A wheeled flowering plant, Florence, conducted Kira's workplace-safety style orientation covering lifting, evacuation, harassment policies, ergonomics, documentation, and related procedures; Buddy interjected commentary and Kira found the training absurd but complied while exhausted and in pain.
      - Kira completed a 20-question assessment, scored 18/20 (90%), and was cleared to proceed to the facility medical evaluation; Scout escorted her toward the medical area.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV: Kira oscillates between exasperated disbelief and weary resignation. She is angry and incredulous that a living facility’s first response to a stranded, injured astronaut is bureaucratic workplace safety training—that mismatch fuels sharp frustration. At the same time her physical pain and exhaustion push her into a hollow, patient numbness: she goes through the motions of the orientation and quiz because she must, not because she believes it. When the assessment ends and she’s cleared for medical evaluation, a pragmatic relief and quiet hope intrude; practical help is finally forthcoming, and she steels herself to endure a little longer.  

      Reader: Readers will likely feel a mixture of wry amusement and empathic irritation at the absurdity (the plants’ earnest bureaucratic behavior is darkly comic), combined with sympathy for Kira’s physical suffering and fatigue. The final beat delivers a small exhalation of relief and renewed anticipation for medical care.  

      Beats and dominant tone: There are clearly multiple emotional beats here: primary comic frustration at the mismatch, a prevailing numb/resigned exhaustion as Kira endures the ceremony, and a closing note of relief/hope. The dominant tonal movement in the passage is from frustrated incredulity into weary acceptance, capped by modest relief.  

      Comparison to pattern so far: This continues the established emotional arc of the story — expectation/anticipation interrupted by absurd or threatening friction, then pragmatic acceptance — while recycling the recurring comedic/ironic beat (plants + bureaucratic formality) introduced earlier. The passage reinforces the story’s pattern (anticipation/dread → frustration → acceptance/relief) but shades it with fatigue and surreal, bureaucratic humor rather than immediate danger, preventing monotony while deepening Kira's emotional exhaustion.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="frustration">POV: Sharp exasperation and incredulity at the surreal, inappropriate workplace-safety orientation—anger derives from the mismatch between her immediate needs (medical care, water, rest) and the facility's procedural priorities. Reader: amused disbelief combined with sympathetic irritation on Kira’s behalf; the absurdity produces dark humor but also heightens worry because time and energy are being wasted.</beat>
      <beat tags="numbness, acceptance">POV: Deep physical exhaustion and hollow patience as Kira endures the long presentation and quiz despite its irrelevance; she answers mechanically, showing resigned compliance rather than engagement. Reader: a sinking empathy — the humor gives way to poignancy as Kira’s pain and depletion become primary, producing a weary quiet that slows the scene’s energy.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, hope">POV: Pragmatic relief and cautious hope when orientation finishes and she is cleared for medical evaluation—the bureaucratic obstacle is over and real care is imminent, letting Kira summon the will to continue. Reader: a modest exhalation and renewed anticipation that the plot will move toward tangible aid and recovery.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage completes the intake sequence begun previously and foregrounds a handful of concrete developments (a named coordinator, a mobile plant platform, an assessment gating access to care) while otherwise continuing many outstanding mysteries. I treated discrete events that occurred (orientation happening and the assessment gating medical evaluation) as fulfilled because they pay off earlier setups. Broad, ongoing mysteries and worldbuilding threads (navigation failures, shuttle/crew fate, ecosystem anomalies, survival deadlines, plant archival/communication habits, Remedy's limited window) remain relevant and thus carried forward. Tentative, atmospheric hints that have not been contradicted are kept open rather than lapsed. I introduced new promises focusing on mobility/tool-use by plants, Florence as a recurring coordinator figure, the gatekeeping function of orientation/assessment, the imminent medical evaluation, and the plants' color-shifting as a communicative channel — marking those as firm if they instantiate playable plot mechanics (named agent, access control, imminent medical), tentative where they are suggestive (salvage origin, precise semantics of color shifts, possible recruitment of Kira). No previous open promise was clearly abandoned or rendered moot by this passage, so I did not mark any of them as lapsed.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="ORIENTATION_DURATION_FOUR_HOURS">The facility's orientation requirement that delayed Kira's medical evaluation (previously presented as a four-hour protocol) was executed — orientation occurred and was mandatory before medical evaluation could proceed.</promise>

      <promise id="LIFE_SUPPORT_EMERGENCY_48_HOURS" tentative="false" introduced="4">The shuttle's limited life-support reserves remain an urgent deadline necessitating shelter, water, or rescue; Kira's relocation to the facility affects but does not resolve this deadline.</promise>
      <promise id="SHUTTLE_TEMPORARY_SHELTER_UNSTABLE" tentative="false" introduced="4">The damaged shuttle remains a fragile refuge; replacement shelter, repairs, or relocation options are still unresolved (the plant facility is an immediate alternative).</promise>
      <promise id="LOCAL_FLORA_POTENTIAL_TOXIC_OR_INEDIBLE" tentative="true" introduced="4">Whether local plants are edible, toxic, or otherwise useful remains unknown—some flora (Remedy) are medically useful, but food/toxicity remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="MAINTAINED_FOREST_HINT" tentative="true" introduced="5">The organized, social plant behavior and the constructed living facility reinforce the possibility that the environment is tended, engineered, or ecologically structured rather than wild.</promise>

      <promise id="LIVING_ARCHITECTURE_RESPONSIVE" tentative="false" introduced="8">The Central Coordination facility is a grown, living structure (woven vines, bioluminescence) that breathes, grows, and can be shaped for use—implies large-scale horticultural engineering and responsive habitat capabilities.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_WRITTEN_RECORDS_AND_ARCHIVAL" tentative="false" introduced="8">Plants can produce written/inscribed records (bark-sheets with symbols) and compare/file them—establishes archival record-keeping and persistent memory.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_COLLECTIVE_AS_EMERGENCY_CONTACT" tentative="false" introduced="8">The plants offer to list their collective as Kira's emergency contact and to coordinate responses on her behalf—this creates a social/legal mechanism of support but also entanglement.</promise>
      <promise id="INTEGRATION_OFFERED" tentative="false" introduced="8">The facility frames Kira's arrival as an opportunity for integration (onboarding, orientation, workplace safety training), signaling the plant collective intends to assimilate or formally connect newcomers into their systems.</promise>

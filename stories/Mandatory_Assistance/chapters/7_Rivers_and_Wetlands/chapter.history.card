        Territory Two - WETLANDS! Completely different terrain, Kira excited. Streamwalker (musical, flowing) and Brightbloom (bouncy, enthusiastic) are a different dynamic but equally delightful. "Water plants! Buddy, there are WATER PLANTS!" River crossings are exciting. Journey pattern becomes joyful rhythm.

        Three days through Territory Two wetlands - and Kira loves the change! Streamwalker (calm, musical) and Brightbloom (cheerful, bouncy) offer different dynamic from Territory One. River crossing: exciting! Buddy fascinated by water-based plant networks. Wetland plants have different communication methods. Journey pattern becoming joyful rhythm - new territory, new guides, new wonders. Farewell at second boundary easier - not less fond, just trusting the process.

        New territory excitement! Different terrain = different wonders. Buddy asks about aquatic plant communication (Remedy wanted to know!). River crossing adventure. Journey rhythm as joy not endurance.

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage largely continues the territory-handoff arc and shows Kira actively adapting to wetlands and new guides. It provides concrete payoff for the previously signaled wetland hazards and the introduction of the new Territory Two guides (their personalities and competence are demonstrated through the river crossing). Most other plot threads tied to the wreck, ship systems, SAM, biologics, coordination with Elder Heartwood, long-term survival logistics, Buddy’s limits, and bureaucratic records remain untouched and therefore still open. The passage also introduces a few new, smaller foreshadowing setups around wetlands infrastructure, water agency, shelter design, and Kira’s improving adaptability that can have future consequences.</reasoning>

        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I recorded facts that matter for future continuity: new, persistent environmental characteristics of Territory Two (terrain, vegetation, hydrology), specific navigational/route details (river width/depth, distance to crossing, stones/path placement, time to shelter), guide behaviors and methods that define how future crossings and guidance will be handled, Scout’s demonstrated competence with water, and a quantifiable logistics detail (wet clothing adds ~2 kg). I omitted transient sensory details (Kira’s immediate feelings, momentary dialogue, exact timing of sunset) and anything already established in previous facts (e.g., that Territory Two is wetlands, or the identities of the guides). No contradictions with earlier facts were found.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_GROUND_SOFT_SATURATED">Territory Two ground is soft, spongy, and water-saturated; boot impressions fill with water seconds after stepping (yielding, sometimes splashy underfoot).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_CANOPY_OPEN_AND_BRIGHT">The canopy opens to wide sky in this sector of Territory Two, producing a brighter, wetter, more colorful environment than Territory One's shaded forest.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_VEGETATION_WETLAND_SPECIES">Vegetation in this part of Territory Two includes tall reeds, broad-leafed water plants, floating mobile plant clusters, and bright purple/yellow/orange flowering species adapted to saturated conditions.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RIVER_DISTANCE_QUARTER_KILOMETER_AHEAD">A river crossing was detected roughly a quarter kilometer (≈250 m) ahead of the group during the travel segment.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RIVER_CROSSING_SPECIFICS">The river at the chosen crossing is about twenty meters wide, roughly chest depth at the crossing point, has a gentle current, and contains a stable stepping-stone path beneath the surface—stones understood/maintained by the territorial network (described as 'placed by the network generations ago').</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_STREAMWALKER_CROSSING_METHOD">Streamwalker guides crossings by moving first and instructing travelers to 'step where I step'; they test the surface with extending vines, use wide vine spread for balance, and rely on guiding with the current rather than fighting it.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BRIGHTBLOOM_BEHAVIOR_ENTHUSIASTIC_BOUNCY">Brightbloom is highly enthusiastic and physically bouncy; they provide frequent encouragement, will cross rapidly (can bound across shallow crossings), and emphasize positive framing and sensory details (e.g., flower bloom/ fragrance timing).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_WATER_CONFIDENCE">Scout (the small sphere) entered the river confidently, bobbed/ floated on the surface, and accompanied the party across the water without difficulty.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_WET_CLOTHING_WEIGHT_INCREASE_2KG">Buddy reports that soaked clothing adds approximately two kilograms to Kira's carried weight and recommends wringing out excess moisture to reduce load.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_TIME_TO_TONIGHT_SHELTER_3_HOURS">Streamwalker estimated the distance/time from the river crossing to the evening shelter at about three hours of gentle walking (no further crossings planned for the day).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLOWERING_PLANTS_RELEASE_FRAGRANCE_AT_SUNSET">Some flowering species in the wetlands release their fragrance around sunset to attract night pollinators (noted as an observable, repeatable nightly behavior).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: the narrator opens with “Two hours into Territory Two,” and earlier (in the previous passage) the handoff/entry into Territory Two was described as occurring mid-afternoon (~15:00). Within the passage there are additional explicit timing markers: Streamwalker: “River ahead. Quarter kilometer. We'll cross before evening.” After the crossing the narrator asks distance to tonight’s shelter and Streamwalker replies “Three hours.” The passage ends at the evening shelter as the sun sets and flowers begin releasing fragrance. Combining these cues gives a coherent timeline: they entered Territory Two around mid-afternoon (~15:00), two hours later (start of this passage) they reach the river (~17:00), cross it (minutes), then walk about three hours to the evening shelter (arrive ~20:00) where sunset occurs and they camp. No large unexplained gaps are present; the sequence of events (two-hour approach to river, brief crossing, three-hour walk to shelter, sunset) is internally consistent.</reasoning>
        <starts>~17:00</starts>
        <ends>~20:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~2 hours (previous passage ended mid-afternoon ~15:00; the passage begins “two hours into Territory Two,” matching the earlier note that they had about two hours before the first river crossing)</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The stated two-hour approach to the river matches the earlier handoff comment (“about two hours before the first river crossing”), the crossing itself would take minutes, and a three-hour walk through wetlands to a raised evening shelter is reasonable. Details like clothes mostly drying by arrival and sunset timing are consistent with ~3 hours of walking in sun. No implausible time compression or unexplained leaps are present.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Kira (first-person narrator) is the protagonist throughout. Buddy, Streamwalker, Brightbloom, and Scout are physically present and active in the scene (they speak or move). Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are mentioned by name (referred to as being back in Territory One) so they count as appearing even though they're not with the group. No new characters arrive during this passage, and no characters who were present at the start leave before the passage ends. The only relevant entity from the provided list is the planet (the passage is set in a sequence of territories on the planet).</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage shows Kira and her party two hours into Territory Two (wetlands). Important plot events to add: characterization of the new guides (Streamwalker: waterlike, patient; Brightbloom: enthusiastic), the river crossing (≈20 m wide, chest-deep at crossing, stones maintained by the plant network), Scout and Kira both cross successfully with Streamwalker's guidance, Buddy provides practical feedback (hydration, wet weight, wellness logging), they reach a raised-reed evening shelter where they will continue deeper into the wetlands the next day. I consolidated earlier travel/rhythm details and guide handoff info already covered, removed some repetitive atmospheric minutiae, and kept only facts that affect ongoing travel, safety, relationships, and plans.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active with limited battery.
          - Shuttle hull breached; planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
          - Kira received care at the Holloway plant collective, was given temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Remedy treated her leg and transmitted medical records; Holloway noted a potential micronutrient gap.
          - Buddy estimated external rescue/search reach measured in months; Holloway filed a relay but Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait.
          - Two Territory One guides (Leafwhisper and Rootwalker) escorted Kira for several days; Buddy and Scout accompanied her; the group established a steady travel rhythm and Kira learned about plant-networked territories.
          - At the Territory One/Two boundary Kira handed off to Territory Two guides Streamwalker and Brightbloom; Leafwhisper and Rootwalker departed.
          - Two hours into Territory Two (wetlands), Kira notes ecological differences and new guide dynamics: Streamwalker is waterlike and patient; Brightbloom is buoyant and enthusiastic; Scout bonded with Brightbloom.
          - They encountered a river ~20 m wide with a gentle current and chest-deep crossing point; Streamwalker led using submerged stones maintained by the plant network.
          - Scout entered and traversed the river confidently; Kira crossed successfully following Streamwalker's guidance without incident, gaining confidence; Buddy monitored vitals and logged the moment, advised on wet weight and hydration.
          - After the crossing they continued across saturated, soft ground toward a raised-reed evening shelter; clothes mostly dried while walking.
          - At the shelter Streamwalker confirmed the plan to go deeper into the wetlands the next day; Brightbloom celebrated Kira's successful adaptation to new guides.

        <reasoning>POV: Kira moves through three linked emotional moments: first a renewed sensory wonder at how different Territory Two is (color, water, new guide personalities), then a quick pang of grief/nostalgia for Leafwhisper and Rootwalker that she consciously acknowledges and lets go of, and finally a confident, quietly joyful sense of competence and hopeful acceptance when she crosses the river and proves she can adapt. The feelings are grounded in concrete causes: the wet, bright environment and charismatic guides for wonder; a memory-triggered ache for lost companions for grief; and a successful, embodied river crossing (plus Scout/Brightbloom/Streamwalker’s support) for the competence/hope beat. Reader experience: uplifted curiosity and sensory pleasure in the worldbuilding, a soft pang of bittersweet empathy at Kira’s nostalgia, and genuine satisfaction/relief and renewed investment when she succeeds and feels capable. There are multiple beats rather than one dominant tone — wonder, then brief grief/acceptance, then accomplishment-driven hope. Compared to the story so far, this passage continues the recurring arc toward acceptance and agency but refreshes it: instead of procedural frustration or acute dread, the emotional palette is lighter (wonder + confident hope). Acceptance/hope recur, but here they signal growth (adaptation to new guides) rather than resignation or boredom, so the pattern feels progressive rather than repetitive.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="wonder">POV: Vivid sensory astonishment at Territory Two—the bright wetlands, new species, and Streamwalker/Brightbloom’s contrasting presences lift Kira out of earlier fatigue. Cause: the altered terrain, colors, sounds (or lack of them), and the guides’ personalities. Reader: Feels curiosity and uplifted pleasure at the fresh, well-rendered setting and the novelty of new companions.</beat>
          <beat tags="grief, acceptance">POV: A brief, sharp pang of sadness remembering Leafwhisper and Rootwalker, immediately followed by a conscious acceptance that those guides belong to the previous territory. Cause: a nostalgic comparison when encountering plants Leafwhisper would have loved, then deliberate self-calming. Reader: Experiences bittersweet empathy—sadness for the loss but reassurance as Kira processes it and moves on.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, acceptance">POV: Growing confidence, relief, and hopeful agency during and after the river crossing—Kira proves to herself she can trust new guides and handle new terrain. Cause: Streamwalker’s calm guidance, Scout’s example, Brightbloom’s encouragement, and the successful, embodied crossing. Reader: Feels satisfied and optimistic, a rewarding emotional payoff (relief + anticipation) that renews investment in Kira’s journey. Pattern note: Acceptance and hope recur here but as constructive momentum (adaptation) rather than stasis, so emotional repetition is present but feels like growth rather than redundancy.</beat>

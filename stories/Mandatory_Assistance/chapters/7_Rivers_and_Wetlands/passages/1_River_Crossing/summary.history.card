      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>Two hours after the boundary handoff the party traveled through Territory Two wetlands. The passage describes the ground as saturated and spongy (boots leaving shallow, water-filled impressions), open sky with scattered trees (reduced canopy), standing pools and channels, and diverse wetland vegetation (tall reeds, broad-leaf water plants, clusters that float/move, purple/yellow/orange flowers). About a quarter-kilometer from where Streamwalker announced the river, they encounter and cross a ~20 m–wide, dark greenish-brown river with a gentle current and chest-depth at the crossing point; submerged stones form a stable path placed/maintained by the territory network. Scout and Brightbloom traverse the water confidently; Streamwalker leads by feeling the current. Kira wades through, gets soaked (boots and pants waterlogged, jacket wrung out), but the sun and walking dry clothing; Buddy monitors vitals and records data. After roughly three more hours of walking they arrive at evening shelter: a raised woven-reed platform surrounded by flowering bushes beginning to release scent at sunset. No injuries or missing equipment are reported. The party (Kira, Scout, Streamwalker, Brightbloom) is on the platform at dusk, clothing mostly drying, vines from Streamwalker trailing into the water, and wetlands remain soft, waterlogged, and traversable with guide assistance. Future travel will lead deeper into softer, wetter ground and more water crossings.</reasoning>
        <state>It is evening in Territory Two wetlands. Kira, Scout, Streamwalker (vine-like) and Brightbloom (orange-flowered bush) are on a raised woven-reed platform shelter at sunset; Streamwalker’s vines trail into the water. The area around them is open-sky wetlands: spongy, waterlogged ground with standing pools, channels, tall reeds, floating plant clusters and colorful flowers releasing fragrance. Earlier they crossed a ~20 m-wide, dark greenish-brown river with a gentle current at a chest-depth point using a submerged stone path. Kira’s clothing and boots are waterlogged but mostly wrung/drying in sun and movement; Buddy continues to monitor vitals and record wellness data. No physical injuries or lost gear are reported. The route ahead leads deeper into softer, wetter terrain with additional water features and crossings expected.</state>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage stages immediate payoffs around the wetland crossing and expands the setting and guide dynamics, but it does not resolve most of the planet-/mission-level threads introduced earlier. The explicit near-term hazard from the previous passage (the river crossing) is enacted and paid off: Kira crosses successfully with Streamwalker and Brightbloom's help. The passage introduces several new, story-relevant setups tied to wetlands (softer terrain, maintained crossings, purification plants, deeper wetlands ahead, wet shelters, moisture logistics, hinted past incidents) and strengthens the social/functional bond between Kira and the new guides (trust-building). Most earlier open promises (ship status, rescue timeline, SAM status, plant governance, documentation/consent implications, resource and long-term-survival threads, Scout limits, luminous mushrooms, spiral-type time perception, etc.) remain relevant and should be carried forward because the passage neither resolves nor renders them moot. I found no strong evidence that any previously listed promise has been abandoned or made irrelevant by this text; therefore LAPSED_PROMISES is empty.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="TERRITORY_TWO_WETLANDS_RIVER_CROSSING__IMMINENT_HAZARD">The quarter-kilometre river crossing that was promised as an imminent hazard in the previous passage is executed and paid off: Streamwalker leads, Streamwalker and the stones beneath the water provide a maintained path, Scout and Kira cross (cold, soaked, but safe), and the guides demonstrate competence. The immediate crossing threat is resolved.</promise>

          <promise id="DAILY_DEPENDENCE_ON_MUSHROOM_SUPPLY">Repeated use of mushroom-based provisioning confirms dependence but logistics, variability and failure modes remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="CONSENT_AND_DOCUMENTATION_IMPLICATIONS">Kira’s records have been shared with plants; consent, obligations and future implications remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_BUREAUCRACY_IMPACT_ON_SURVIVAL">Bureaucratic time-costs might still conflict with urgent needs and remain an ongoing risk.</promise>

          <promise id="TERRITORIAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_MAINTAINED__REST_SHELTERS_AND_PATHS">Maintained rest shelters, path markers and springs continue to appear regularly; who maintains them and why is unresolved. (This passage confirms wetland reed platforms and placed stones but not the maintainers' identity.)</promise>
          <promise id="ROOTWALKER_PREDICTIVE_NAVIGATION_AND_PROTECTION__FOLLOWUP_TESTS">Rootwalker's competence has been shown again; this remains an actionable expectation but could still be tested by future obstacles.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_LIMITS_AND_ENDURANCE">Scout shows high energy but visible fatigue; companion endurance and limits remain a narrative variable.</promise>
          <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_CONTINUAL_CHATTER__INFO_OVERLOAD_RISK">Leafwhisper's relentless explanatory style continues to be both exposition and a possible liability for Kira (distraction, miscommunication).</promise>
          <promise id="NIGHT_SHELTER_COMPOSITION_AND_SECURITY">Shelters continue to be woven plant-structures with moss beds and fruiting mushrooms; their comfort is confirmed but security/defenses/governance roles remain to be examined.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_PROMISE_SPIRAL_TYPES_TIME_PERCEPTION__POTENTIAL_EFFECTS">Spiral-type plants were introduced as perceiving time in layered rather than linear ways — a setup that could create unusual causal/communication effects or long-timescale knowledge later.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_PROMISE_SCOUT_LEARNING_PATTERN__UTILITY_OR_LIMITS">Scout is shown learning rest-stop and investigation patterns; this sets up increasing utility (finding things, alarms) or limits (fatigue, exposure) for future beats.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_PROMISE_LUMINOUS_MUSHROOMS__UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES">Scout inspected luminescent mushrooms — an introduced element whose toxicity, communicative role, or network function is unresolved and could become important.</promise>
          <promise id="TERRITORY_TWO_GUIDES_INTRODUCED__STREAMWALKER_AND_BRIGHTBLOOM">Streamwalker and Brightbloom are named and characterized as the Territory Two guides; their styles, reputation, and possible agendas remain set up for future interactions (competent here but motives still unexplored).</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKER_SPIRAL_PATTERN__POTENTIAL_SIGNIFICANCE">The clearing’s spiral stone-and-flowers boundary marker is a visually prominent element (could be ceremonial, functional, or a plot-relevant signal) now introduced.</promise>
          <promise id="GUIDE_COORDINATION_DOCUMENTATION_FLAGS__KIRA_NOTABILITY">Streamwalker mentioned coordination documentation that praised Kira — this confirms Kira’s notability in plant records and reinforces prior threads about unusual attention/expedited processing.</promise>
          <promise id="EMOTIONAL_ATTACHMENT_AND_FAREWELL_IMPACT__PERSONAL_COST">The goodbye scene foregrounded emotional attachment and separation distress as a cost and potential vulnerability going forward; that personal cost remains a live thread.</promise>
          <promise id="WETLANDS_TERRAIN_SATURATION__LONG_TERM_MOBILITY_RISK">New: The wetlands' soft, saturated ground is now foregrounded as a sustained terrain condition that may impede travel, conceal hazards, or fatigue gear and companions over time.</promise>
          <promise id="RIVER_NETWORK_MAINTENANCE__PLACED_STONES_AND_AGENCY">New: Streamwalker's claim that stones beneath the crossing were placed by generations (and the river 'knows the path') establishes a maintained crossing infrastructure and hints at deliberate landscape management or network agency to be explored.</promise>
          <promise id="WETLANDS_PURIFICATION_NETWORK__POTENTIAL_CONTROL_OR_RESOURCES">New: Brightbloom's description of water-filtering plants and mobile nutrient clusters introduces a wetland purification network that could be a resource, a control mechanism, or a vulnerability.</promise>
          <promise id="DEEPENING_WETLAND_HEART__IMMINENT_INCREASED_HAZARD">New: Streamwalker's note that they will go 'deeper into the wetlands' toward the territory's heart tomorrow sets up a near-term escalation (softer ground, more water, new challenges) to be played out.</promise>
          <promise id="REED_PLATFORM_SHELTER__TERRITORIAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_CONFIRMED">New: The raised woven-reed evening shelter confirms that the wetlands have built shelter infrastructure suited to saturated landscapes; maintenance, governance, and resource access related to these shelters remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="WATER_MANAGEMENT_IMPACT_ON_EQUIPMENT__MOISTURE_LOGISTICS">New: Buddy's and Kira's observations about soaked clothing, added weight, and wringing-out logistics introduce a small but persistent resource/logistics problem (wet gear, energy cost, slower drying) to track.</promise>
          <promise id="PREVIOUS_TRAVELER_INCIDENT_HINT__UNDISCLOSED_RISK">New: Brightbloom's throwaway mention of a past incident that was 'fine eventually' sets up an unexplained past mishap that may foreshadow a hidden hazard or policy about rescues/safety in wetlands.</promise>
          <promise id="RIVER_PERSONIFICATION__WATER_AGENCY_POTENTIAL">New: Streamwalker's language ('the river knows where it's going', 'the water wants to help') presents water as an agent-like element connected to the territory, which could indicate local networked behavior or affordances that matter later.</promise>
          <promise id="STREAMWALKER_WATER_SPECIALIZATION__NAVIGATION_SKILL">New: Streamwalker's graceful, water-native movement establishes a concrete capability that could affect future navigation and problem-solving in wet environments.</promise>
          <promise id="GUIDE_TRUST_BUILDING_EFFECT__KIRA_CONFIDENCE">New: Kira's successful river crossing with the new guides strengthens her trust in territorial guides and her own adaptability — a character shift that may influence risk-taking or compliance later.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I extracted only details from the passage that matter for future continuity (character capabilities/behaviors, durable world infrastructure, and travel/logistics data). I excluded transient scene descriptions already in the provided summary (time of day, presence of characters, that they crossed a river, platform shelter, Kira's wet clothing, Buddy monitoring vitals, etc.). I included facts that could affect later decisions or continuity: guide techniques, infrastructure ownership/age, Scout's water-capabilities, Brightbloom's signaling behavior, Buddy's quantified weight penalty from water, and the day's travel plan (no more crossings; three hours to shelter). I found no contradictions with the previously established facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="STREAMWALKER_CROSSING_TECHNIQUE">Streamwalker uses their vines to test and stabilize river crossings, stepping into the water ahead and instructing travelers to 'step where I step'—providing a guided, vine-supported crossing technique rather than physical carrying or ropes.</fact>
          <fact id="NETWORK_PLACED_CROSSING_STONES">The submerged stones forming the river path were intentionally placed long ago by the plant/territorial network ('placed by the network generations ago'), indicating maintained, long-lived physical infrastructure for safe crossings.</fact>
          <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_FLOWER_SIGNALING">Brightbloom's blooms visibly respond to emotion/communication (flowers bloom brighter when Brightbloom is excited or speaking emphatically), showing a visible signaling/expressive trait.</fact>
          <fact id="WETLANDS_PURIFICATION_AND_MOBILE_CLUSTERS">Wetlands plants perform active water purification via root systems as part of a territory purification network; some floating plant clusters are mobile and relocate based on nutrient availability (they 'move locations based on nutrient availability').</fact>
          <fact id="SCOUT_WATER_BOUYANCY_AND_CONFIDENCE">Scout is capable of buoyant behaviour in water—'float-bouncing' on the surface and accompanying travelers across rivers—indicating Scout can operate effectively in aquatic/semiaquatic conditions.</fact>
          <fact id="BUDDY_WATER_WEIGHT_PENALTY">Buddy reports that water absorbed by clothing increases Kira's carried weight by roughly two kilograms, a quantified travel/logistics detail that affects stamina and load calculations.</fact>
          <fact id="TODAYS_PLAN_NO_MORE_CROSSINGS_THREE_HOURS">Streamwalker stated there will be no more water crossings for the day and estimated three hours of gentle walking to reach tonight's shelter (a near-term itinerary/plan that affects immediate travel pacing).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Key time cues: the passage opens with "Two hours into Territory Two," which links directly to the end of the previous passage (boundary handoff ~15:00). Earlier in the previous passage Brightbloom said "We've got about two hours before the first river crossing," so the river crossing arrival in this passage matches that two-hour interval. At the river bank Streamwalker states the distance to tonight's shelter is "Three hours. Gentle walking." The passage then describes the crossing (short, likely minutes) and the subsequent three-hour walk to the evening shelter, finishing around sunset when flowers release fragrance. Adding the ~2 hour gap after the previous passage, a short river-crossing interval (minutes to perhaps 0.25 hr), plus the 3-hour walk, gives an end time roughly 3–3.25 hours after the river bank segment began, and ~5+ hours after the previous passage end. Timing details used: “Two hours into Territory Two” (start), Streamwalker’s “Three hours” to shelter (remaining major interval), the described crossing (short), and sunset/evening shelter arrival (end anchor).</reasoning>
        <starts>~17:00</starts>
        <ends>~20:15</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>About 2 hours. The previous passage ended at the boundary in mid‑afternoon (~15:00). This passage begins two hours into Territory Two (walking time after the handoff). During that gap they were walking into the wetlands, noticing ecological changes and approaching the river (Brightbloom had warned there were about two hours before the first river crossing).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The 2‑hour walk from the boundary to the river matches an explicit line in the prior passage and the narrator’s opening. The river crossing itself is presented as short and guided (stones beneath the silt, step-by-step), so only minutes are reasonable for that segment. Streamwalker’s stated three‑hour walk to the evening shelter then explains the remainder of the passage; a 3‑hour gentle walk in wet, soft terrain fits the narrative pacing and the descriptions of drying by walking and arriving at sunset. Minor note: drying "mostly" within that period depends on temperature/sun/wind, but the text already cites sun and platform shelter at evening, so the drying detail is acceptable. Overall, no implausible time jumps or impossible actions given the described intervals.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>Kira (the narrator) is present throughout. Buddy speaks and provides sensor/recording commentary. The guides Streamwalker and Brightbloom actively lead and comment; Scout accompanies them, bounces and crosses the river. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are mentioned (Kira feels pangs and notes they are back in Territory One) so they count as appearing even though they are not physically with the group. No other characters from the available list are named or implied. No new characters enter during the passage (the group set up at the start continues through to the end), and no characters who were present at the start leave before the passage ends. The scene takes place on the planet Sector 7-Gamma-412 (the only relevant entity provided).</reasoning>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage executes the first wetland segment: it stages and pays off the imminent river crossing announced at the boundary, establishes everyday consequences of wet terrain (wet clothing weight, drying while walking), and reinforces that Streamwalker and Brightbloom are active Territory Two guides. Most longer-term mission and survival arcs (ship systems, samples, Elder Heartwood, travel-through-seven-territories, research commitments, Buddy/Florence tasks, plant-network politics) remain relevant and unresolved. Only one older tentative atmospheric hint (Remedy's decomposition remark) has had no reinforcement for many passages and I mark it lapsed; the near-term river-crossing promise was explicitly fulfilled. New, concrete setups introduced here include the ancestral/maintained stone-path under the river (a physical Chekhov-style element to rely on or test later), the explicit plan to go deeper into the wetlands (promising future, softer-ground/water challenges), plus smaller practical/logistic threads (water weight on clothing, the guides' network reputation spread) and an atmospheric suggestion that some rivers 'help' travelers (which could be reversed later). Rootwalker’s earlier touch remains an unresolved tentative foreshadow. In short: the passage pays one clear immediate promise (the two-hour river crossing), leaves the large mission- and survival-level promises intact, lapses one old tentative atmospheric hint, and introduces several new wetland-specific setups that matter for upcoming scenes.</reasoning>

          <promise id="WETLAND_RIVER_HELPFULNESS" tentative="true" introduced="20">An atmospheric/worldbuilding idea introduced here: the river is described as 'wanting to help' travelers (the current guiding rather than fighting). This sets an expectation that some water features will assist travelers, but it can be reversed in future scenes.</promise>
          <promise id="WETLAND_DEEP_HEART_CHALLENGES" tentative="false" introduced="20">Streamwalker says they'll go deeper into the wetlands tomorrow—the territory's 'heart' with softer ground and more water—establishing a near-term promise of increased wetland-specific challenges.</promise>
          <promise id="WATER_WEIGHT_IMPACTS_CARRY_LOAD" tentative="true" introduced="20">Buddy's observation that water adds roughly two kilograms to clothing/gear is an immediate logistical setup that could affect travel logistics and choices going forward.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selected facts are those that introduce persistent, plot-relevant details about Territory Two, the guides, travel progress, and Kira's state that will matter later (route hazards, guides' capabilities, logistics, and Kira's competence/confidence). I did not include ephemeral scene details (exact dialogue, momentary sensory impressions) or items already captured in the provided summary. No genuine contradictions with previously established facts were found—this passage elaborates on Territory Two and guide personalities/behaviors already introduced, and adds specifics that fit existing descriptions and timelines.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_TERRAIN_SATURATED_AND_SPOUNCY">Territory Two ground is saturated, soft/spongy (not quite mud), footprints fill with water seconds after stepping; canopy is more open with brighter, wetter, more colorful vegetation than Territory One.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_SURFACE_WATER_FEATURES">Territory Two contains standing pools, shallow channels, and a river roughly 20 meters wide encountered on the route; water is dark and depth is not visually clear.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RIVER_AHEAD_QUARTER_KILOMETER">A river crossing was located approximately a quarter kilometer from the party's route position in this scene.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RIVER_CROSSING_DEPTH_AND_CHARACTER">The chosen crossing point is about chest height in depth, with a gentle but steady current and stable stones beneath the surface; the current tends to push travelers toward the crossing path rather than away.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RIVER_STONES_MAINTAINED_BY_PLANT_NETWORK">Streamwalker asserts there is a path of stones beneath the river placed/maintained by the territorial plant network generations ago (an established, intentionally maintained safe crossing).</fact>
          <fact id="STREAMWALKER_MOVEMENT_AND_VOICE_SPECIFICS">Streamwalker moves with flowing, water-like grace; uses a soft, musical voice that sounds like wind through hollow reeds and frames guidance in patient, water/metaphor language (e.g., 'the water welcomed you').</fact>
          <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_BEHAVIORAL_AND_COMMUNICATION_CUES">Brightbloom is highly bouncy and enthusiastic; its flowers visibly bloom or brighten with emotion/communication, and it uses energetic, encouragement-focused social behavior to instruct and motivate travelers.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_WETLAND_PLANT_FUNCTIONS_PURIFICATION_AND_MOBILITY">Some wetland plants function as part of a territorial purification network (filtering water through roots) and floating plant clusters can move location based on nutrient availability (mobile floating vegetation used for resource positioning).</fact>
          <fact id="SCOUT_CONFIDENCE_IN_WET_WATER_CROSSINGS">Scout (the small rolling plant) is comfortable and confident in water crossings—bobbing and floating on the river surface and behaving as an active, water-capable companion.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_RHYTHM_AND_SHELTER_TIMING">The party's schedule for this day: three hours to the evening shelter from the river crossing point; no more river crossings planned for the day and gentle walking expected to the shelter.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_EVENING_SHELTER_DESCRIPTION">Tonight's shelter is a raised woven-reeds platform surrounded by flowering bushes (providing drying and rest facilities consistent with Territory Two's traveler services).</fact>
          <fact id="BUDDY_ESTIMATES_WATER_WEIGHT_AND_RECORDS_WELLNESS">Buddy reports that the water absorbed by clothing adds approximately two kilograms to Kira's carried/clothed weight, recommends wringing out moisture and records the accomplishment for wellness documentation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_TRAVEL_CONFIDENCE_INCREASE">Kira demonstrates increased practical confidence and adaptability with territorial travel: she crosses a chest-deep river without panic, explicitly noting reduced fear and greater trust in new guides and rhythms.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage opens with an explicit temporal cue: "Two hours into Territory Two..." The previous passage is authoritative-ended at 2687-03-25T16:00, so the start of this passage is two hours later. Within the passage they reach a river shortly after the opening, cross it (a brief episode), then Streamwalker says the evening shelter is three hours away. The narrative then covers that three-hour walk and arrival at the evening shelter at sunset. Total elapsed within this passage is the brief river-crossing plus ~3 hours walking. There is a minor external discrepancy: a previous summary gave ~15:00 as the end time, but the authoritative outline time provided is 16:00 and matches the "two hours" cue used here. Overall the sequence (2 hours after boundary to river; short crossing; ~3 hours to shelter) is internally consistent and plausible for a day of guided travel and a sunset arrival.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-03-25T18:00</starts>
        <ends>~2687-03-25T21:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>2 hours. The previous passage ended at 2687-03-25T16:00; the narrator says "Two hours into Territory Two," so roughly two hours of walking/initial terrain transition occurred between passages (what they did: entered Territory Two, walked through the initial wetland landscape toward the river).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Two hours of travel to reach the river, a short (minutes-scale) crossing, and then ~3 hours of gentle walking to an evening shelter fits a realistic hiking/pacing timeline. The drying of clothes during a few hours of walking in sun is reasonable. The only minor issue is the earlier summary timestamp (~15:00) that conflicts with the authoritative 16:00; using the provided authoritative 16:00 resolves that and makes the timing consistent.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters present: The narrator Kira (Kira_Voss) and the guides Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Scout, and the support AI Buddy all appear and interact directly in the passage. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are explicitly mentioned (referred to as being back in Territory One) so they count as present/mentioned even though they are not physically part of this scene. No new characters arrive during this passage (no one “enters” mid-scene), and no characters who were present at the scene start leave before the passage ends (no clear in-scene exits). The location is the wetlands in Territory Two on the planet context, so the relevant entity from the provided list is the planet (/world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.card).</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage primarily advances the travel through Territory Two: Kira encounters wetter, open-canopy wetlands; meets the personalities and navigation style of the new guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom); the group crosses a chest‑deep river using a network-maintained stone path with Streamwalker's guidance; Scout and Brightbloom accompany the crossing; Kira crosses successfully without panic and continues to an evening reed-platform shelter where clothes dry and the team plans to go deeper into the wetlands next day. I added those concrete events and emotional/skill developments (Kira learning to trust new guides) and consolidated earlier, now less-essential details (e.g., long descriptive atmosphere notes, prolonged explanations of farewells) into concise bullets. Outstanding technical problems (Biological Samples container, SAM offline, broken external comms/distress beacon, Elder Heartwood response) remain listed as unresolved.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM is offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (including Scout, Holloway, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle served as temporary shelter.
          - The Biological Samples container remains active, glowing, drawing power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Kira integrated with the plant collective and Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor); Remedy treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for formal permissions; Elder response is pending.
          - Kira received inter‑territorial travel approval; departure was organized with Buddy and Scout assigned to accompany her.
          - Territory One guides Leafwhisper (mycorrhizal/network specialist) and Rootwalker (terrain specialist) escorted Kira through Territory One; she established a travel rhythm and learned key aspects of plant society (Consensus Groves, root/fungal resource and information networks, merged organisms, varied cognition types).
          - On the third morning Kira reached the boundary to Territory Two; two Territory Two guides (Streamwalker, a flowing vine-like guide, and Brightbloom, an enthusiastic flowering bush) met the group and accepted responsibility; Leafwhisper and Rootwalker departed; Scout remained with Kira.
          - Two hours into Territory Two Kira noted the wetlands' softer, wetter terrain and different plant community and learned Streamwalker and Brightbloom's distinct guiding styles (calm/flowing vs. energetic/encouraging).
          - The group encountered a ~20 m river with chest‑depth at the crossing point; Streamwalker led using a submerged stone path maintained by the territory network; Kira, guided step-by-step and supported by Scout and Brightbloom, crossed successfully without panic.
          - Buddy monitored physiological/emotional status during the crossing and offered practical suggestions (e.g., wringing out water); Kira celebrated the successful crossing and adaptation to new guides.
          - They walked to an evening shelter (raised woven-reed platform surrounded by flowering bushes); clothes dried while they rested; Streamwalker said they would go deeper into the wetlands the next day.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues still matter: the active Biological Samples container, SAM remaining offline, broken external communications/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood’s pending response.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV feelings: Kira is primarily quietly adaptive — curious and observant about the new wetlands, slightly wistful at leaving familiar guides, then growing into confident competence as she crosses the river. The wistfulness comes from real attachment to Leafwhisper/Rootwalker; the confidence and light joy come from successfully applying lessons learned (trusting guides, finding rhythm) to a new environment. Reader experience: the reader moves with Kira from gentle wonder (new, brighter terrain) through a small anxious moment at the crossing into a satisfying beat of accomplishment and relief. The passage contains multiple emotional beats rather than a single tone: an opening bittersweet/longing note, a central tension-to-triumph crossing sequence, and a closing acceptance/renewed determination. Compared to the story so far, this continues the arc of Kira shifting from traumatized survivor to engaged traveler. Earlier beats established trust-building and tentative integration; here that trust consolidates into practical skill and confidence — a mid-level, earned victory rather than a dramatic plot turn. Surprises: there are no major world or plot reveals; the only surprise is a character-level reversal: Kira surprises herself (and the reader) by genuinely meaning "I'm ready" and crossing with calm competence. Character change: Kira advances in concrete, repeatable ways — skill acquisition (river-crossing) and an identity/attitude shift (accepting new guides, owning her role as a traveler). Brightbloom also subtly moves toward a mentor/cheerleader role with Scout and Kira, reinforcing the social scaffolding that supports Kira's growth.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="longing, acceptance">Kira feels a soft pang of longing and sadness remembering Leafwhisper and Rootwalker as she notices how different Territory Two is. That sadness quickly resolves into pragmatic acceptance — she consciously tells herself it's okay that guides and place change. The reader experiences gentle poignancy that is immediately steadied by Kira's resolve to continue.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, relief">The river crossing is the passage's emotional center: initial physical shock and low tension (cold water, wobbly stones) transition into concentrated determination as Kira follows Streamwalker's instructions. When she reaches the far bank, relief and joy wash over her — a concrete accomplishment that affirms her growing competence. The reader shares a small surge of triumph and catharsis.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, determination">After the crossing Kira settles into a renewed, optimistic rhythm: she appreciates the wetlands' beauty, accepts the new guide dynamic, and feels confident about continuing. This beat is hopeful and resolute — the reader closes the scene with a warm sense that Kira's identity as an adaptive traveler is consolidating.</beat>

        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="character, reversal">Kira's own internal surprise — she says 'I'm ready' and genuinely means it, then crosses with calm competence. Given earlier moments when she flinched and had to relearn trust, her immediate, steady handling of the river is a small but notable reversal of her earlier fragility and an unexpected confirmation of growth.</surprise>

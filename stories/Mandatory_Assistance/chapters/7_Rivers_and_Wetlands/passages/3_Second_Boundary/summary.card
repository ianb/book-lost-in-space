  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>Trackable, objective facts at the end of the passage: time is morning; the group has moved from the reed-platform shelter to the territorial boundary clearing marked by a circle of tall stones with flowering vines. Streamwalker and Brightbloom (wetland guides) have returned into the wetlands and are moving away. Two new guides — Oakshade (an ~8-foot tree-like being) and Mossmantle (a low, ~3-foot, moss-and-flower covered being) — stand beside the stones and have taken over guiding. Kira has packed her gear and is physically present with Scout and the new guides, and begins walking into Territory Three (hill country) with hills and rockier, firmer ground ahead. Scout is active and investigating. Plant-signaling behaviors (Brightbloom’s flower patterns, Streamwalker’s vines, and guide-to-guide contact) have occurred; Brightbloom and Streamwalker made physical contact with Kira before leaving. There are no new injuries; Kira is uninjured and continuing the journey (clothing/boot may still bear previous mud/wetness from the swamp). The boundary markers, packed gear, and the directionality of movement (wetlands behind, hills ahead) are relevant for future scenes.</reasoning>
    <state>It is morning at the Territory Two/Three boundary: a clearing with a circle of tall stones threaded with flowering vines. The reed-platform shelter has been packed up. Streamwalker and Brightbloom have returned into the wetlands to the rear. Oakshade (an ~8-foot tree-like guide) and Mossmantle (a low, moss-and-flower guide) stand beside the stones and lead the party forward into Territory Three. Kira, with Scout alongside and personal gear packed (clothing/boots likely still damp/mud-tinged from the earlier swamp incident), is walking after Oakshade and Mossmantle toward hillier, rockier terrain with firmer ground and visible rises ahead. No one is injured; plant-based guide signals and brief physical farewells (vine contact, floral gestures, a gentle bump/hug) have just occurred.</state>
  </physical-reality>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      Summary of analysis:
      - What was fulfilled: The scheduled handoff to Territory Three (the boundary meeting and transfer to new guides) that had been flagged as a near-term event is executed in this passage: Streamwalker and Brightbloom hand Kira off to Oakshade and Mossmantle at the boundary. This resolves the specific open promise about the Territory Three handoff.
      - What lapsed/was abandoned: I found no previously-listed promise that was explicitly dropped or rendered irrelevant in this passage. Most systemic and investigatory threads (ship failures, SAM, rescue timeline, plant governance, contamination, etc.) remain untouched and therefore remain open.
      - What remains open (carried forward): Nearly all prior open promises that concern technical mysteries, governance, long-term rescue/survival, plant agency, documentation/consent, and logistical risks are still unresolved. Several wetland-specific threads (testing protocol, flower-signal system, Streamwalker vine-extraction dependency, frequency of collapse, maintenance of territorial infrastructure, etc.) remain relevant.
      - Newly introduced promises/setups in this passage: The introduction of Oakshade and Mossmantle (their skills, partnership, and three-day hill-country plan), the specific stone-circle boundary marker variant, the visible guide-to-guide handoff ritual/transfer, an explicit three-day duration for Territory Three, and reinforcement of the journey pattern (temporary teams and farewells) which raises new questions about emotional cost and Kira’s growing trust (and potential overtrust risk). Scout’s immediate integration with the new guides also creates a new thread about Scout’s role and limits with successive guide teams.
      Decision notes:
      - I marked only the explicit boundary handoff as fulfilled because it was a scheduled, concrete event listed in the open promises and it occurs here.
      - I did not mark promises that were simply demonstrated again (e.g., guide competence, attachment behavior) as fulfilled; they remain open where they imply longer-term consequences or unresolved mechanisms (e.g., who maintains territorial infrastructure, whether plant motives are benign, data-sharing/consent implications).
      - No prior promise was clearly abandoned or made moot by this passage, so the LAPSED_PROMISES list is empty.

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I identified lasting character traits, social/operational behaviors, and timetable details that would affect later scenes (guide handoffs, planner expectations, Kira's emotional baseline). I excluded transient details (time of day, exact phrasing of dialogue, immediate actions) and facts already in the provided summary/list. No statements in the passage contradict previously established facts, so no conflicts are listed.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_THREE_DURATION_3_DAYS">Territory Three's segment for Kira's intended route is expected to take three days (Mossmantle: 'Three days through hill country').</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_ATTACHMENT_TENDENCY">Brightbloom consistently forms strong emotional attachments to travelers and experiences sadness at farewells ('I get SO attached!', 'it hurts a little saying goodbye').</fact>
      <fact id="GUIDE_HANDOFF_PHYSICAL_COMMUNICATION">Guides exchange handoff information via patterned physical contact (vines touching branches, flowers blooming in communicative patterns) during boundary transfers.</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_AFFECTIONATE_TOUCHES">Brightbloom sometimes uses gentle, tactile gestures (rolling forward to bump a traveler's leg — a 'flower-bush hug') as an affectionate farewell behavior.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_ACCEPTS_TRANSIENCE">Kira's emotional state has shifted toward acceptance of temporary relationships with guides: she anticipates farewells calmly and frames them as part of the journey rather than as devastating losses.</fact>
      <fact id="STREAMWALKER_FAREWELL_PHILOSOPHY">Streamwalker frames farewells as an integral, balanced part of the territories' pattern (mourning and celebration can be simultaneous; 'farewells are part of the pattern').</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Time cues in the passage: it opens with “The third morning comes,” and the guides are packing and preparing in early light. Streamwalker explicitly says “The boundary is about two hours ahead,” and the party starts walking, reaches the boundary, spends a short amount of time exchanging farewells and information transfer with the new guides, then departs into Territory Three. The previous passage ended in the evening (given by the provided previous-ending-time ~19:30). So the current passage begins the next morning and covers the final morning walk and the handoff at the boundary. How much time passes in this passage: roughly the duration of a morning walk to the boundary (~2 hours) plus a brief farewell/hand-off (a few to maybe fifteen or twenty minutes). When it ends: just after the handoff and when the narrator starts into Territory Three. Gap from previous passage: overnight rest/sleep and morning prep — about 11–12 hours between ~19:30 and a typical morning start. Plausibility: This is plausible. An evening stop at ~19:30 followed by an overnight rest and an early-morning departure fits normal travel pacing. A two-hour walk to the boundary and a short exchange of farewells and guide-to-guide communication is reasonable in the time given. The only ambiguity is the exact morning hour (not stated), but using “morning light” and the stated two-hour travel time gives a coherent timeline with no implausible rush or unexplained delays.</reasoning>
    <starts>~07:00</starts>
    <ends>~09:15</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~11.5 hours (overnight rest and morning preparations). During this gap they likely slept, packed, and prepared at the reed-platform shelter.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence — evening stop (~19:30), an overnight rest, a morning departure, a two-hour walk to the boundary, and a brief handoff/farewell — fits normal travel pacing and the actions described. The only small ambiguity is the exact start time (the text gives ‘morning’ but not a clock time), but the two-hour walking cue makes the passage’s duration realistic.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters appearing in the passage: Kira Voss (narrator), Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Scout, Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, and two new guides introduced by name: Oakshade and Mossmantle. Streamwalker and Brightbloom begin the scene with Kira (they were part of the previous group) and they leave at the boundary to return to Territory Two, so they exit during the passage. Oakshade and Mossmantle appear at the boundary (they were not present at the start), so they enter during the scene. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are mentioned (learning/trust references) but do not enter or exit here. Buddy and other listed characters are not mentioned. The only provided entity relevant to the scene is the planet/setting (/world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet). Note: Oakshade and Mossmantle are named in the passage but were not in the supplied list of available character card paths; I have nevertheless included them below as characters who appear and who enter.</reasoning>

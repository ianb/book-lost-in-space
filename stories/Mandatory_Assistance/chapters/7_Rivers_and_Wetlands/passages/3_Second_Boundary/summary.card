  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only new, story-relevant facts that affect ongoing continuity: introduction/assignment of new guides (names, appearances, roles), the terrain and travel-duration for Territory Three (matters for planning and future scenes), the fact of an official handoff/boundary passage, the boundary's physical marker (could be referenced later), and a noticeable change in Kira's emotional response to farewells (character development). I did not record transient scene details (time of day, immediate actions, Scout's momentary behavior) or items already captured in the provided summary. I checked these facts against the entire existing fact set and found no contradictions with previously established information.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HANDOFF_TO_TERRITORY_THREE_COMPLETED">Kira is formally handed off at a territorial boundary from Streamwalker &amp; Brightbloom to a new pair of guides who will escort her through Territory Three.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GUIDES_OAKSHADE_MOSSMANTLE_ASSIGNED">Two new Territory Three guides are introduced and assigned to Kira: Oakshade (a tree-like, ~8 ft tall, bark-covered, deep-resonant-voiced guide) and Mossmantle (a low, ~3 ft, compact guide covered in small purple flowers and dark green moss that moves by an internal/unknown mechanism).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_THREE_TERRAIN_HILLY_STONE">Territory Three is characterized by hill country with more climbing, stone formations, and much less water than the wetlands encountered in Territory Two.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_THREE_TRAVEL_ESTIMATE_3_DAYS">Oakshade states the segment through Territory Three will take roughly three days of travel.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BOUNDARY_MARKER_TERRITORY_THREE_DESCRIPTION">This territory boundary is marked by a clearing with a circle of tall stones and flowering vines growing between them (distinct marker for this transfer point).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BRIGHTBLOOM_PHYSICAL_FAREWELL_CONTACT">Brightbloom performs a physical farewell: rolling forward and gently bumping against Kira's leg (a tactile 'flower-bush hug') before departing.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_FAREWELL_ACCEPTANCE">Kira's emotional response to farewells has shifted toward acceptance and calmer resignation—she is sad but not devastated, indicating growing emotional resilience toward temporary guide relationships.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the passage: it opens with “The third morning comes” and the previous passage closed in the evening (~19:00). The guides say “The boundary is about two hours ahead,” and the passage describes walking from the reed-platform shelter to the boundary, a brief handover/conversation, farewells, and then immediately setting out into Territory Three. Therefore the passage begins the morning after the previous evening shelter (an overnight rest), includes ~2 hours of walking plus perhaps 10–30 minutes for the boundary arrival, introductions, and farewells, and ends when the new team departs and the narrator starts walking into the hills.

      Estimated times: previous passage ended ~19:00. Overnight rest and packing plausibly occupy the intervening night. Starting the morning at roughly 07:00–08:00 is reasonable for travel; using the boundary estimate of two hours of walking plus a short handover yields an end time around 09:30–10:00. The gap between passages is therefore an overnight interval of roughly 11–14 hours.

      Plausibility: The timing is plausible. An overnight rest after the evening shelter, morning packing, then a two-hour morning walk to the boundary fits the dialogue and actions described. The handover and brief farewells would comfortably fit into the additional 10–30 minutes. No major timing inconsistencies are evident.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>~07:30 (third morning, approximate)</starts>
    <ends>~09:30 (third morning, approximate)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~11.5–12.5 hours (overnight). The group spent the night at the reed-platform shelter (~19:00 to early morning), slept, packed, prepared, then set out in the morning. This explains the gap between the previous evening scene and the current morning scene.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Overnight rest and morning preparations account for the interval after the prior ~19:00 ending. The two-hour travel estimate given by Streamwalker matches the described walk to the boundary, and a short (10–30 minute) handover/farewell period fits before the new guides depart. No significant timing problems.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters present in the passage: Kira Voss (the narrator); Streamwalker and Brightbloom (the departing guides); Scout (travelling companion); Leafwhisper and Rootwalker (mentioned by the narrator as previously trusted guides); Elder Heartwood (referenced as the destination to reach). Two new guides, Oakshade and Mossmantle, appear at the boundary and join the party — they clearly enter during the scene. Streamwalker and Brightbloom exit the scene, returning to the wetlands. Note: Oakshade and Mossmantle are named in the passage but are not included in the provided list of available character card paths, so I cannot list card paths for them. The only provided entity in the available entities list is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet; Territory Two/Three, the wetlands, and the boundary are relevant locations in the scene but do not have provided entity card paths, so they're not listed in the entity array below.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage records a territory handoff and emotional farewell, so I added the handoff events and new guides and consolidated earlier, repetitive details about plant communication and guide dynamics. I removed atmospheric descriptions (sunlight, birds, detailed flower-encoding examples) and consolidated multiple prior bullets about plant-communication lessons and guide pair dynamics into single items that remain plot-relevant (what Kira learned and the rescue from the swamp). The updated bullets keep the chronological chain: crash and survival, initial care and decision to travel, Terr. One guides, handoff to Terr. Two, events during Terr. Two (swamp rescue, lessons), farewell, and handoff to Terr. Three with Oakshade and Mossmantle and Kira's continued plan to reach the Elder Heartwood.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active with limited battery.
      - Shuttle hull breached but planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and a Scout companion, and filed a relay; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
      - Kira traveled first with Territory One guides Leafwhisper and Rootwalker for several days; Buddy and Scout accompanied her; she learned basic plant-networked territory practices.
      - At the Territory One/Two boundary Kira handed off to Territory Two guides Streamwalker (calm, waterlike) and Brightbloom (buoyant); Leafwhisper and Rootwalker departed.
      - Streamwalker and Brightbloom guided Kira through wetlands for three days, teaching river-crossing techniques and plant communication methods (flower signals, waterborne cues); Scout explored and tested the system.
      - While traversing saturated ground Kira's left leg fell into a hidden swamp hole; Streamwalker used vines to pull her free; Kira sustained no serious injury.
      - On the third morning Kira and the Territory Two guides exchanged emotional farewells; Brightbloom hugged Kira and Streamwalker offered a final vine contact before returning to the wetlands.
      - At the Territory Two/Three boundary two new guides—Oakshade (tall, tree-like) and Mossmantle (low, mossy/stonelike)—met Kira; they will guide her through three days of hill country with more climbing and stone navigation; Scout continues with her.
      - Kira notes the recurring territory-by-territory handoffs, feels more confident and practiced at trusting guides, and continues toward the Elder Heartwood.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV emotions: The passage is dominated by a quiet, bittersweet acceptance. Kira is tenderly sad at leaving Streamwalker and Brightbloom but not devastated — she recognizes the pattern of temporary teams and feels steadier, more practiced. That steadiness includes warmth and belonging (the guides mattered), plus a forward-facing readiness and anticipation for Territory Three. The causes are explicit: the ritualized goodbye, the guides' candid admissions of attachment, and Kira's own learning that farewells are part of the journey. Reader experience: Readers will likely feel a soft, affectionate melancholy mixed with uplift — empathy for the goodbye, satisfaction at Kira's growth, and renewed curiosity/hope about the next stretch. Multiple beats: There are three interwoven beats — (1) bittersweet farewell (acceptance + grief), (2) anticipatory readiness for the next territory (anticipation + hope), and (3) a deeper sense of belonging and self-efficacy (belonging + acceptance). Dominant tone is gentle acceptance tempered by sadness; anticipation provides forward momentum. Comparison to pattern so far: This continues the story's recurring cycle of connection → parting → forward motion, but the emotional texture has softened. Earlier farewells carried sharper grief or surprise; here the repetition shows growth — the pattern is turning from traumatic losses to practiced transitions and agency, reducing raw dread/grief and increasing calm acceptance, belonging, and constructive anticipation.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="acceptance, grief">Bittersweet farewell to Streamwalker and Brightbloom. POV: tender sadness and acceptance — Kira feels her throat tighten but is not devastated; she recognizes the ending as necessary and meaningful. Cause: the conscious goodbye, the guides' admissions of attachment, and Kira's own learning that bonds can be real and temporary. Reader: warm empathy and a gentle pang of sadness, softened by the scene's affectionate tone and Kira's emotional growth.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">Readiness for the next leg of the journey. POV: energized calm and forward-focused anticipation as new guides (Oakshade, Mossmantle) arrive and Kira mentally readies herself for hill country; the goodbye converts into practical momentum. Cause: the arrival of competent new guides, Scout's buoyancy, and Kira's growing confidence. Reader: uplift and curiosity — relief that Kira retains agency and interest in the next challenge, plus hope that she will continue to adapt and succeed.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">A developing sense of belonging and competence. POV: quiet affirmation — Kira internalizes the pattern (temporary teams, meaningful connections) and feels more like a traveler who belongs to the procession of territories rather than an isolated survivor. Cause: repeated positive interactions with guides, effective rescues/teaching moments, and Kira's reflective acknowledgment of what she's learned. Reader: warm satisfaction and reassurance; the emotional repetition (goodbyes) is present but now signals growth rather than only loss.</beat>
    </beats>
  </emotional-journey>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage is a transitional chapter: a handoff at a territorial boundary, emotional closure for the guide pair, and introduction of the next-territory guides and terrain. The main fulfilled beats are the expected guide relay and the visible boundary markers. The passage reinforces several ongoing worldbuilding threads (plant signalling, guide personalities, Kira's growing trust) but does not resolve long-running plot mysteries (crash coordinates, SAM, navigation failure, shuttle stability, long-term survival). A few older, tentative threads that have received no reinforcement in many passages (notably atmospheric/light anomalies) can reasonably be considered lapsed. New setups that were introduced here and may matter later are the explicit introduction of Oakshade and Mossmantle (the Territory Three guides), a clear, firm statement of the next territory's terrain (hills/climbing, three-day stretch), and an explicit, witnessed guide-to-guide information transfer during the handoff (vines/branches/flower-pattern exchange) that may carry traveler's data or other handoff details. The passage also foregrounds Mossmantle's unusual locomotion (movement mechanism not identified), which is a small, tentative setup that could be used later. Emotional patterning of farewells and Kira's continued growth are reinforced rather than newly introduced.</reasoning>

      <promise id="GUIDE_PERSONALITY_DYNAMIC_LEAFWHISPER_CHATTER_VS_ROOTWALKER_RETICENCE" tentative="true" introduced="16">Contrast in guide personalities continues to be an ongoing dynamic and a lens through which new guide pairs will be judged.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_WILL_MONITOR_AND_REQUEST_REPORTS" tentative="true" introduced="16">Remedy's expectation to receive reports from Kira remains in place.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_INTEGRATED_SYSTEM" tentative="false" introduced="17">The territories' integrated biological systems remain central to the setting and potential plot developments.</promise>
      <promise id="GUIDE_CHATTY_INFORMATION_OVERLOAD" tentative="true" introduced="17">The pacing and volume of guide-provided information remains an ongoing consideration as Kira meets new teams.</promise>
      <promise id="ROOTWALKER_GUARDIAN_BEHAVIOR" tentative="true" introduced="17">The model of guardian behavior provided by Rootwalker remains a relevant comparison for new guides.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_POSSIBLE_CONNECTION_TO_NETWORK" tentative="true" introduced="17">Speculation about human access to the network is still live; guide-to-guide exchanges at boundaries hint at opaque data transfer that could relate.</promise>

      <promise id="GUIDE_HANDOFF_INFORMATION_TRANSFER" tentative="false" introduced="22">During the boundary handoff, guides exchange information via vines/branches/flower-pattern contact; this transfer is opaque to Kira and may carry traveler data or other procedural notes for incoming guides.</promise>
      <promise id="MOSSMANTLE_MOBILITY_MECHANISM_UNSPECIFIED" tentative="true" introduced="22">Mossmantle is described as moving via a mechanism the narrator can't immediately identify — a subtle setup that invites later explanation about mobility methods among plant-beings.</promise>

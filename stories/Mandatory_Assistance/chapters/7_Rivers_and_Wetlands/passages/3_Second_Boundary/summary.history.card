      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I reviewed the previous open-promises list against events in the current passage. The passage chiefly stages a boundary handoff: Streamwalker and Brightbloom complete their escort and transfer Kira to Oakshade and Mossmantle at the Territory Three boundary. That directly resolves the near-term logistics promises about Territory Two guides completing their segment and meeting Territory Three guides; it also shows Brightbloom explicitly broadcasting praise/reputation to the next guides (so the tentative reputation-broadcast promise is instantiated). Most other longer-term mission threads (bio-samples, life support, Elder Heartwood query, Remedy tasks, route/timeline, Scout/Buddy research, flower-language training, plant network mechanics, etc.) are background or long-range and are neither resolved nor contradicted here, so I carried them forward as still open. The only clear lapse in the previous list was the previously-noted WETLAND_DEEP_HEART_CHALLENGES item (it had already been marked as lapsed in the prior open list), so I list it as lapsed again with a short rationale. I also recorded the new, concrete promises introduced by this passage: formal introduction of Oakshade and Mossmantle as Territory Three guides (firm, short-term escort for ~three days), the hill-country/stone terrain description (firm), and a couple of softer hints about guide-to-guide information exchange and the plants' physical affectionate contact (tentative).</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="TERRITORY_TWO_GUIDES_AND_WETLAND_GUIDANCE">Streamwalker and Brightbloom complete their escort: they lead Kira to the boundary, perform the handoff, and return to Territory Two — their guiding segment is finished.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage documents the boundary handoff from the wetland guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom) to a new pair of Territory Three guides, and it characterizes Territory Three as hillier, rockier country requiring climbing. The most important long-term facts are the identities and descriptions of the new guides (Oakshade and Mossmantle) and the reclassification of Territory Three's terrain and expected escort duration. These matters affect travel planning, expected hazards, and who Kira will interact with for the next segment of the journey. The passage contradicts a previously established mapping that labeled Territory Three as wetlands/river systems, so I flagged that conflict. I did not include transient details (sentiment at the moment, exact phrasing of goodbyes, or the immediate two-hour boundary timing) because they are scene-specific and not necessary for long-term continuity.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_OAKSHADE_AND_MOSSMANTLE_INTRODUCED">At the Territory Two/Three boundary Kira is handed off to two new guides: Oakshade (a tree-like guide ~8 ft tall with a deep, resonant voice and steady presence) and Mossmantle (a low, compact guide ~3 ft high covered in small purple flowers and dark green moss, with an earthy, softer voice and a mechanical or salvaged mobility mechanism).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_THREE_RECHARACTERIZED_AS_HILLY">Territory Three is described by the incoming guides as 'hill country'—hillier terrain with more climbing, less water, stone/rock formations, and scenic views; the planned escort through Territory Three will take about three days.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts>
          <conflict id="TERRITORY_THREE_TERRAIN_CONFLICT" with-fact="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TYPES_SEQUENCE">Previously, Territory Three was established as 'wetlands and river systems' (part of the sequence: Territory Three = wetlands/river systems). In this passage, Territory Three is described as hillier, rockier hill country with less water and climbing required. These descriptions conflict about the fundamental terrain character of Territory Three.</conflict>
        </conflicts>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage explicitly opens “The third morning,” which places it the morning after the previous passage ended that evening. The previous passage end (authoritative) is 2687-03-26T20:00, so the next morning is the 27th. The text gives several time cues: packing and a morning departure, Streamwalker saying “The boundary is about two hours ahead,” then a walk, arrival at the boundary, handovers and short farewells, then immediate onward movement into Territory Three. That sequence implies: an overnight stay, morning pack/leave (maybe 15–45 minutes), roughly two hours of walking to the boundary, and a brief handoff (minutes to ~30 minutes). I estimate the passage begins early morning and ends mid-to-late morning the same day. STARTS and ENDS below use reasonable approximations; actual times could vary by an hour or so based on how long the packing/farewell exchange took.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-03-27T07:30 (approx)</starts>
        <ends>2687-03-27T10:15 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>11 hours 30 minutes (from 2687-03-26T20:00 to ~2687-03-27T07:30). During that gap: overnight rest on the reed-platform shelter, usual morning preparations/packing and the guides’ routine before departure.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline supports an overnight rest and a morning departure. Streamwalker’s “about two hours ahead” aligns with the walk described; packing and farewells fit into the remaining time. The gap is enough for sleeping, morning chores, and the short handover at the boundary. Minor uncertainty exists in the exact durations of packing and the farewell exchange, but nothing in the passage requires an implausible compression of time.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Kira (the narrator) and the two wetlands guides Streamwalker and Brightbloom are present throughout the scene; Scout is explicitly present and travels with them. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are mentioned by name in reflection, and Elder Heartwood is mentioned as a destination. Two new guides (Oakshade and Mossmantle) arrive in the scene, but those characters do not have card paths in the provided list, so they cannot be included in the Entered list per the instruction to use only the given paths. Streamwalker and Brightbloom leave (return to Territory Two) before the scene ends. No provided entity cards (Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet or Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone) are referenced in the passage, so the Entities list is empty.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage describes a routine handoff between Territory Two guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom) and new Territory Three guides (Oakshade and Mossmantle). Significant plot events to add: it was the last day with Streamwalker and Brightbloom; they bid farewell, exchanged guide-to-guide information with Oakshade and Mossmantle, Brightbloom physically hugged Kira, Streamwalker offered a parting vine-contact, and Kira crossed the boundary into Territory Three to begin a three-day hill-country traversal with Oakshade and Mossmantle while Scout remains with her. I consolidated earlier travel/guide details so the running summary stays focused on persistent plot elements (crash, SAM/communications issues, active Biological Samples container, medical recovery, permission to travel, progression through Territories One and Two, key incidents like river crossing and swamp rescue) and removed repetitive atmospheric detail. Outstanding technical and narrative problems (Biological Samples container, SAM offline, broken external comms/distress beacon, Elder Heartwood’s pending response) remain listed.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM is offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (including Scout, Holloway, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle served as temporary shelter.
          - The Biological Samples container remains active, glowing, drawing power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Kira integrated with the plant collective and Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor); Remedy treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for formal permissions; Elder Heartwood’s response is pending.
          - Kira received inter-territorial travel approval; departure was organized with Buddy and Scout assigned to accompany her.
          - Territory One guides Leafwhisper (network specialist) and Rootwalker (terrain specialist) escorted Kira; she learned about the fungal/root networks and plant societal structures.
          - At Territory One/Two boundary Leafwhisper and Rootwalker left; Territory Two guides Streamwalker (water-oriented) and Brightbloom (floral/visual signaling) joined; Scout remained with Kira.
          - In Territory Two Kira learned wetland communication (chemical signals through water, visual flower-pattern signaling), crossed a chest‑deep river via submerged stone path with Streamwalker’s guidance, and was rescued from a thigh‑deep swamp sink by Streamwalker’s vines; Buddy monitored her vitals throughout.
          - Kira grew confident trusting guides and adapted quickly to new territories and styles of navigation.
          - On the third morning in Territory Two Streamwalker and Brightbloom guided Kira to the boundary, then formally handed her off to Territory Three guides.
          - Streamwalker and Brightbloom said farewell (Brightbloom gave a gentle physical hug; Streamwalker made vine contact); they exchanged guide-to-guide information with the new guides Oakshade (tall, tree-like) and Mossmantle (low, moss/flower-covered).
          - Kira crossed into Territory Three and began a three-day hill-country traversal with Oakshade and Mossmantle; Scout continues to accompany her.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues still matter going forward: the active Biological Samples container, SAM remaining offline, broken external communications/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood’s pending response.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV feelings: Kira experiences a layered, quiet acceptance. She's sad to leave companions she's come to rely on, but the grief is tempered by understanding—she expected this ending and has internalized the travel pattern. That gives her steadiness: she can feel loss without being undone, and she meets the new guides with anticipatory confidence. Reader experience: warmth and mild poignancy, followed by reassurance and forward momentum. The passage delivers two connected emotional movements: a bittersweet farewell that feels intimate rather than catastrophic, then a small lift as new guides appear and the journey continues. Compared to the story so far, this is a consolidation beat: earlier scenes moved Kira from shock and isolation through rebuilding trust and skills; here those changes register as durable habits (calm goodbyes, fluent cross-species rapport). There are no major plot surprises—most actions align with established patterns—though Brightbloom's physical, affectionate bump is a small, tender gesture that reads as an emotional punctuation rather than a plot twist. Character growth: Kira's travel identity and emotional regulation are reinforced (acceptance, trust, confidence). The guides briefly reveal vulnerability (admitting attachment) and offer tangible warmth; two new guides are introduced as competent, steady replacements. Overall tone: intimate closure + stable forward motion rather than suspense or crisis.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="acceptance, intimacy">Kira feels a bittersweet calm—throat-tight but not wrecked—because she anticipated this goodbye and has learned the territory pattern. The reader feels warm poignancy: a farewell that matters but is manageable, reflecting Kira's emotional maturation and reinforced belonging.</beat>
          <beat tags="vulnerability, joy">The guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom) admit attachment and show clear affection (Brightbloom's flower-bush hug, Streamwalker's tactile vine). Their vulnerability converts the farewell into a mutual, joyful sorrow. The reader experiences tenderness and emotional reciprocity—the relationship is two-way, not just Kira's loss.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, hope">Meeting Oakshade and Mossmantle shifts the tone to steady anticipation: Kira tightens into practical readiness and quiet confidence. The reader is reassured—the journey continues with competent guides, producing forward momentum and hopeful expectation.</beat>
        </beats>

          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="identity-shift">Consolidates earlier growth into emotional resilience: she accepts temporary attachments without collapsing, frames farewells as part of a pattern, and consciously steps forward with confidence. This reinforces her emergent traveler identity and emotional regulation.</development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="trust-built">Demonstrates increased trust and composure—she thanks her guides, accepts their parting gestures, and quickly transitions to engaging with new guides rather than lingering in panic or grief.</development>
          <development character="Brightbloom" tag="vulnerability-shown">Opens up about emotional cost—admits getting attached and expresses it physically (the gentle bump/hug). This shows overt vulnerability and reinforces Brightbloom's role as emotionally generous guide.</development>
          <development character="Streamwalker" tag="vulnerability-shown">Articulates the guides' philosophy about flow and endings and offers deliberate, quiet physical contact—revealing warmth beneath their calm exterior.</development>
          <development character="Oakshade" tag="revelation">Introduced as a stable, steady Territory Three guide—establishes presence and authority, setting expectations for a different terrain and style of guidance.</development>
          <development character="Mossmantle" tag="revelation">Introduced as a compact, grounded partner—their earthy voice and practical assurances reveal the pair's complementary competence for hill country.</development>
          <development character="Scout" tag="relationship-shift">Continues to accompany and immediately investigates the new guides, reinforcing its steady companion role and implicit commitment to Kira's journey.</development>

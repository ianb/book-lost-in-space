    The third morning came with bittersweet awareness.

    Last day with Streamwalker and Brightbloom.

    I pack her things at the reed-platform shelter, watching the guides prepare for the final stretch. Streamwalker's vines moved with their usual flowing grace, testing the morning air. Brightbloom's flowers glowed in early light, already blooming enthusiastically.

    Three days together. Not long. But enough to learn their rhythms, their voices, their way of working as a team.

    And now it would end.

    But this time, I know it was coming. Had been expecting it. The pattern was clear now.

    "Ready?" Streamwalker asked, their musical voice carrying gentle awareness. They knew this was goodbye too.

    "Yeah," I say. "Let's walk."

    They walked.

    The wetlands in morning light were beautiful—water reflecting pink and orange sky, flowers opening with the sun, birds-or-whatever-they-were calling in reed clusters. Everything alive and bright and temporary.

    Like the guides.

    "The boundary is about two hours ahead," Streamwalker said. "Easy walking. The ground firms up approaching Territory Three."

    "Less water there!" Brightbloom added. "More hills and rocks—completely different terrain! The Territory Three guides are excellent with elevation and stone-based navigation, very skilled!"

    Scout bounced alongside, apparently unaware that another farewell approached. Or maybe Scout understood better than I do—connections could be real and temporary simultaneously, valued for what they were rather than mourned for what they weren't.

    "I learned a lot from you two," I say after they'd walked a while. She wanted to say it while there was still time. "The river crossing, the flower communication, the way you work together—calm and energy balancing each other. It's been really good."

    "You've been an excellent traveler!" Brightbloom's flowers bloomed brighter. "Very adaptable, asking good questions, handling challenges well! We'll tell the Territory Three guides how wonderful you are!"

    "You found your pace," Streamwalker added. "Trust in the journey. That's rare for new travelers. Most fight the current."

    "I had good teachers," I say. "In both territories."

    They walked through changing landscape. The ground did firm up—less water, more solid earth mixed with the wetland soil. Different plants appeared, species transitioning between territories. The boundary approaching.

    "Can I ask something?" I say.

    "Always!" Brightbloom bounced encouragingly.

    "Do you get attached to travelers? To the people you guide?"

    There was a pause. Streamwalker's vines undulated thoughtfully. Brightbloom's flowers opened and closed in a pattern I have learned meant "considering response."

    "Yes," Streamwalker said finally. "Each traveler is different. Each journey unique. The time together matters, even knowing it's temporary. Water flows through—you can't hold it—but the flowing still changes the riverbed."

    "I get SO attached!" Brightbloom admitted cheerfully. "Every time! It hurts a little saying goodbye! But that means the time together was real, you know? If it didn't hurt, the connection wouldn't have mattered!"

    "So you're sad too?" I ask. "About me leaving?"

    "Of course!" Brightbloom's flowers drooped slightly. "You're wonderful! I'll miss your questions and Scout's investigations and the way you smiled when you realized you'd started trusting us! But—" The flowers lifted again, "—you're continuing your journey! Reaching Elder Heartwood! That's wonderful! The goodbye serves the bigger goal!"

    Streamwalker made their gentle sighing sound. "Farewells are part of the pattern. The territories require it—each guide knows their land. We can mourn the ending and celebrate the continuing. Both true simultaneously."

    I feel her throat tighten but not with the sharp grief of the first farewell. This was different. Softer. Acceptance mixed with sadness.

    She was learning.

    "There," Streamwalker said, raising a vine-hand. "The boundary."

    Another clearing. Another set of markers—this time a circle of tall stones with flowering vines growing between them, beautiful and deliberate.

    And waiting beside the stones: two new plant beings.

    One looked like a small tree—maybe eight feet tall, bark-covered trunk, branches spreading wide with silver-green leaves. Solid. Rooted but somehow mobile.

    The other was low to the ground, maybe three feet high, covered in small purple flowers and dark green moss. Compact and steady, moving via some mechanism Kira couldn't immediately identify.

    Her new guides.

    Territory Three.

    my chest tightened with that familiar mix—anticipation and loss, nervousness and confidence.

    "Excellent timing!" The tree-being's voice was deep and resonant, like wind through forest canopy. "I'm Oakshade. This is my partner, Mossmantle. We'll be guiding you through Territory Three."

    "Three days through hill country," Mossmantle added. Their voice was softer, earthy, like stones settling. "Different terrain. Good climbing. You'll like it."

    Streamwalker and Brightbloom approached the new guides. There was a moment of communication—vines touching branches, flowers blooming in patterns, some kind of guide-to-guide information transfer that Kira couldn't fully follow.

    Then Streamwalker turned back to Kira.

    "Our part of the journey ends here," they said, musical voice carrying warmth. "The river blessed your crossing. May the hills bless your climbing."

    I step forward. "Thank you. For everything. The patience, the teaching, the rescue from the swamp hole—"

    "That was fun!" Brightbloom bounced closer. "You're a WONDERFUL traveler, Kira Voss! Keep asking questions! Keep trusting the guides! Keep being curious about everything!"

    "I will," Kira promised.

    Brightbloom's flowers bloomed in a pattern—the one that meant safe path ahead, but also something else. Goodbye, maybe. Or good wishes. Hard to translate.

    Then Brightbloom did something unexpected. They rolled forward and very gently bumped against my leg. A flower-bush hug.

    "Travel well!" Brightbloom said, voice bright but wobbling slightly. "Reach Elder Heartwood! Find your answers! Be wonderful!"

    "You too," I say. "Help more travelers. Keep the enthusiasm. It really does help, even when it's exhausting."

    Brightbloom's entire structure glowed with pleasure.

    I turn to Streamwalker. The tall vine-plant stood flowing and serene as always.

    "Thank you," I say simply. "For the calm. For teaching me to trust the current."

    Streamwalker extended one vine. Not to help her walk, not to rescue her from a swamp hole. Just... contact. Connection.

    I take the vine gently.

    "The river flows," Streamwalker said softly. "You flow with it. Remember that in the hills—different terrain, same principle. Find the path of least resistance. Trust the guides who know the land."

    "I will," I say.

    The vine retracted.

    Streamwalker and Brightbloom turned back toward Territory Two—toward wetlands and rivers and water-based plants waiting for their guides to return.

    "Safe travels!" Brightbloom called, already moving. "Tell everyone you meet that you crossed wetlands with Streamwalker and Brightbloom! We'll remember you!"

    Streamwalker raised a vine. One last wave. Then they disappeared into the wetlands, flowing and bouncing, calm and energy, a balanced pair returning home.

    I stand at the boundary feeling... okay.

    Sad, yes. She'd miss them—Streamwalker's musical wisdom, Brightbloom's enthusiastic encouragement. But not devastated. Not lost.

    Because she understood now.

    This was how it worked. Temporary teams. Real connections. Necessary endings.

    And the journey continued.

    "Ready?" Oakshade asked. The tree-being's voice carried patient strength. "Territory Three is hillier. More climbing, less water. But the views are worth it."

    "And the stone formations are beautiful!" Mossmantle added. "Very different from wetlands. You'll adapt."

    Scout bounced once, then rolled toward the new guides, already investigating.

    I take a breath. Looked back once at the wetlands—bright and beautiful and already past. Then forward to Territory Three—hills visible in the distance, new terrain waiting.

    "Yeah," she said. "I'm ready."

    Oakshade moved forward with steady grace. Mossmantle rolled smoothly beside them. Scout bounced ahead, enthusiastic as always.

    And I follow.

    New guides. New territory. New challenges.

    Same journey.

    She'd learned to trust Leafwhisper's cascading information and Rootwalker's grounded silence.

    She'd learned to trust Streamwalker's flowing calm and Brightbloom's bouncing energy.

    Now she'd learn to trust Oakshade and Mossmantle. Learn their rhythms, their voices, their way of working together.

    And in three days she'd say goodbye to them too.

    And keep going.

    Because that was the pattern. That was the journey.

    Territory by territory. Team by team. One impossible adaptation at a time.

    And Kira Voss—cargo specialist, crash survivor, accidental long-distance traveler—was learning to be good at it.

    The hills rose ahead.

    She walked forward.

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I reviewed the prior open-promises list and compared each item to events and dialogue in this passage. The passage mainly reinforces guide competence, demonstrates wetland-specific hazards (a ground collapse), clarifies wetland communication (waterborne chemicals and flower-pattern signaling), and establishes that the next day will end with a boundary handoff to Territory Three guides. I treated explicit statements and repeated mechanics as firm (e.g., waterborne chemical signalling, flower-sign patterns, the routine of wetland collapses and guide extraction), and I treated ongoing character/arc items (Kira's growth/confidence) as tentative ongoing promises. I only marked a promise as fulfilled when the passage presented clear, concrete payoff for an earlier promise (Streamwalker demonstrably handled Kira's extraction and behaved in ways that show they were prepared for Kira's needs), and I lapsed a promise only when the passage directly contradicted or abandoned it (Streamwalker's earlier line about going deeper into the wetlands tomorrow was contradicted by Brightbloom saying the next day is the last day together and they'll reach the boundary by afternoon). Most earlier logistical/plot promises (bio-samples, being stranded, life-support power window, Elder Heartwood petition, route through seven territories, etc.) remain relevant and so are carried forward.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="STREAMWALKER_PREPARED_KIRA_SPECIFICATIONS">Streamwalker had claimed to have reviewed Kira's documentation and be prepared for her needs; in this passage Streamwalker successfully and calmly rescues Kira from a wetland collapse and guides her safely, demonstrating that preparation in practice.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <lapsed>
          <promise id="WETLAND_DEEP_HEART_CHALLENGES">Streamwalker previously promised they'd go deeper into the wetlands 'tomorrow' (a near-term promise of increasing wetland challenges). In this passage Brightbloom says tomorrow is the last day together and they'll meet Territory Three at the boundary by afternoon—this contradicts the earlier 'deeper tomorrow' plan, so the original promise as-stated has been abandoned or rescheduled.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage adds durable details about how Territory Two's plants communicate and operate, plus a measurable safety/behavior pattern and an important psychological shift in Kira. These will matter later for travel logistics, risk assessment, and Kira's willingness to follow plant guidance (e.g., when facing hazards or making decisions under stress). I excluded transient descriptives (mud on a boot, single-shelter arrival) and items already captured in earlier facts (e.g., Scout comfort in water, wetlands being spongy, Streamwalker's testing behavior) and focused on novel, repeatable, or character/state changes that could affect future scenes.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_WETLAND_HYDROCHEMICAL_COMMUNICATION">Wetland plants communicate primarily via chemical compounds carried through water currents—an analog to 'scent on wind' where water transports encoded chemical signals that neighboring plants interpret.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BRIGHTBLOOM_FLOWER_PATTERN_ENCODING">Brightbloom can produce sequential flower-opening patterns (specific counts/positions over time) that encode discrete messages for mobile observers (examples given: a pattern meaning 'safe path ahead' and another meaning 'water nearby').</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BRIGHTBLOOM_SPEAKS_SEVEN_DIALECTS">Brightbloom is fluent in seven distinct plant 'dialects' (a marker of advanced cross-territory or cross-species communication ability).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_STREAMWALKER_VINE_EXTRACTION_ABILITY">Streamwalker can extend vines to physically secure and extract a trapped traveler from wetland collapse—using calm, coordinated actions and a counted lift to free them safely.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_WETLAND_COLLAPSE_FREQUENCY">Wetland footing failures (travelers sinking through deceptive ground) are relatively common—approximately every third or fourth traveler experiences such a collapse—making extraction a routine guide task in this territory.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_TRUST_IN_GUIDES_SOLIDIFIED">Kira's trust in the guides deepened into instinctive compliance under stress: when her leg sank she immediately followed Streamwalker's instructions without hesitation, indicating a shift from tentative confidence to active, trust-based cooperation.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Start cues: The passage opens with "The second morning starts with questions," and describes squelchy, wetter ground compared to "yesterday," so it begins the morning after the previous passage's evening shelter. The previous passage ended at ~2687-03-25T21:00 (evening). How much time passes during the passage: the narrative moves from morning through midday/afternoon activities (the wetland collapse, extended walking, commentary about the sun warming damp clothes) and ends at another raised-platform shelter in the evening. That implies a single daytime span (morning → evening) of travel and short incidents. End cues: they "reach another raised platform shelter" and settle for the night with discussion of "tomorrow" being the last day together, which marks the passage ending in evening. Gap from previous passage: overnight rest between the prior evening (2687-03-25T21:00) and this passage's morning—about 10–12 hours. What likely happened in that gap: camp setup, sleep, morning preparations/breakfast, packing, and setting off again. Timing of events inside the passage: the wetland sink and rescue take only minutes; the rest is hours of careful walking and intermittent explanation/demonstration, consistent with a day of travel. Any timing issues: none significant. The activities described (short rescue, drying/warming while walking, reaching shelter by evening) fit within a typical waking day. The chosen approximate start and end times reflect a reasonable overnight gap and a daytime travel period.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-03-26T07:30 (approximate morning)</starts>
        <ends>2687-03-26T19:00 (approximate evening)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~10.5 hours overnight (previous ended 2687-03-25T21:00; passage begins next morning). Likely: camp overnight, sleep, morning prep and departure.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline allows for an overnight rest after the previous evening shelter and a full day of travel through wetlands. The rescue from the wet collapse is brief and consistent with Streamwalker's quick vine response; drying while walking and reaching a new evening shelter are reasonable within a single day. No implausible time compression or unexplained long gaps are present.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters appearing in the passage are those explicitly present or mentioned: Kira (the narrator "I"), the guides Brightbloom and Streamwalker, Scout, Buddy, and the previously-mentioned Leafwhisper and Rootwalker. All of these were already present at the start of the passage (per the previous-present list), so no one enters during the scene. No character leaves before the passage ends—everyone remains with the group as they reach the evening shelter. No available entity card (Sector 7-Gamma-412_Planet or Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone) is referenced in this passage, so I list no entities as relevant.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage adds details about Territory Two's communication methods (water-borne chemical signaling and Brightbloom's flower-pattern visual codes), an on-trail rescue, and Kira's growing trust and confidence. It also advances the timeline to the next-day boundary with Territory Three. No earlier unresolved items (Biological Samples, SAM offline, broken external comms, Elder Heartwood) are resolved, so they remain. I consolidated repetitive guide-character details and kept only plot-relevant developments: communication methods demonstrated, Scout testing, the wetland collapse and Streamwalker's rescue, Buddy's monitoring, Kira's psychological growth, and arrival at the next shelter with a planned handoff to Territory Three guides the following day.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM is offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (including Scout, Holloway, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle served as temporary shelter.
          - The Biological Samples container remains active, glowing, drawing power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Kira integrated with the plant collective and Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor); Remedy treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for formal permissions; Elder response is pending.
          - Kira received inter‑territorial travel approval; departure was organized with Buddy and Scout assigned to accompany her.
          - Territory One guides Leafwhisper (network specialist) and Rootwalker (terrain specialist) escorted Kira through Territory One; she learned key aspects of plant society (fungal/root networks, merged organisms, varied cognition types).
          - On the third morning Kira reached the boundary to Territory Two; Territory Two guides Streamwalker (flowing, water-oriented) and Brightbloom (florally expressive) met the group; Leafwhisper and Rootwalker departed; Scout remained with Kira.
          - Two hours into Territory Two Kira noted wetlands' softer, wetter terrain and different plant communication style; Streamwalker led using submerged paths and guided footing across water features.
          - They crossed a chest‑deep river via a submerged stone path; Buddy monitored Kira's physiological/emotional state and offered practical suggestions; Kira adapted and celebrated the successful crossing.
          - Second morning in Territory Two: guides explained wetland communication—plants send chemical signals through water currents; Brightbloom demonstrated visual flower‑pattern signaling that encodes messages (examples: 'safe path ahead', 'water nearby'); Scout playfully tested the water communication by splashing.
          - Later that day Kira's left foot collapsed through deceptive wetland ground and sank to mid‑thigh; Streamwalker instructed her to stay still and extended vines to secure and pull her free; the rescue was calm and routine.
          - Buddy monitored Kira's vitals and offered breathing exercises; Kira declined and recovered from adrenaline, muddy but uninjured.
          - Kira realized she now trusts and follows guides without hesitation—evidence of growing confidence and adaptability as a traveler.
          - They continued and reached another raised‑platform shelter surrounded by tall purple reeds; the guides said the next day would be the last with them and they would reach Territory Three boundary to meet new guides.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues still matter: the active Biological Samples container, SAM remaining offline, broken external communications/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood’s pending response.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV feelings and why: Kira moves from curious and engaged to a spike of fear (when her left foot collapses) and then into relief, calm, and a quiet pride. The fear is immediate and bodily—panic at sinking thigh-deep—but it is short-circuited by the guides' confident, procedural rescue. Afterward Kira experiences a steady, reflective satisfaction: she recognizes her own growth (trusting without hesitation) and the normalization of these risks into routine travel.

          Reader experience: The reader shares the curiosity at the opening (learning about water-based plant communication), then is drawn into a brief, visceral suspense when Kira’s leg collapses. The rescue resolves that suspense quickly and cleanly, producing relief and a warm afterglow of reassurance. The last emotional note is quietly uplifting — the reader senses Kira’s consolidation into a competent traveler and feels companionable warmth toward the guides.

          Multiple beats or single tone: There are three emotional beats: wonder/curiosity (learning about water-communication), sudden fear/suspense (the swamp collapse), and relief/acceptance with self-recognition (being pulled free and realizing she now trusts and has grown). The passage therefore contains multiple distinct beats but they form a coherent arc from curiosity through crisis to growth and calm.

          Comparison to pattern so far: This continues the established arc of Kira moving from frightened survivor to confident traveler. Earlier scenes showed tentative trust (river crossing, relearning to rely on guides); here that trust is enacted reflexively and affirmed. Tonally the passage is lighter and more secure than early aftermath beats, matching the steadying, hopeful pattern of recent travel sections.

          Surprises for the reader: There are no major surprises in the sense of hidden secrets or character reversals. The calm, routine handling of a sinking traveler is consistent with what we already know about the guides’ competence; learning that the wetlands regularly 'test' travelers is new information but not a narrative surprise.

          Character growth/revelation: Kira reveals and consolidates real trust: she does not hesitate or panic, she follows instructions automatically, and afterward recognizes that trust as personal growth. This is a concrete trust-built and skill-learned moment in her arc — from ‘‘I hope they help’’ to ‘‘I trusted them and it worked.’’ The guides’ competence and comforting habits are reinforced but not newly revealed — they continue to display established personalities (Brightbloom exuberant, Streamwalker calm).

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage adds several durable world- and character-level details that matter for future scenes: how wetland plants communicate (chemical signaling via water currents), Brightbloom's concrete communication method (flower-opening sequences with agreed meanings), Brightbloom's fluency in multiple plant dialects, the guides' practical rescue/care technique (using vines to support and extract travelers), the relative frequency of wetland-footing incidents (every three-to-four travelers), and a clear character-state change for Kira: increased trust in the guides and confidence as a traveler. I omitted transient/actionable details (boots muddy, immediate time of day, Scout splashing) because they don't affect long-term continuity. I also checked for contradictions with the previously established facts and found none — these details extend and specify territory-two behavior and guide capabilities already implied earlier, but do not conflict with existing items.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_WATER_PLANTS_COMMUNICATE_VIA_CHEMICAL_CURRENTS">Wetland/water plants in Territory Two communicate by releasing specific chemical compounds into water currents; the water carries those compounds to neighbors who interpret the chemical composition as messages.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BRIGHTBLOOM_FLOWER_PATTERN_COMMUNICATION">Brightbloom uses deliberate sequences/patterns of flower openings and closings (spatial/temporal patterns of blooms) to encode and signal specific meanings to observers (examples given: 'safe path ahead' and 'water nearby, approach with awareness').</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BRIGHTBLOOM_SPEAKS_SEVEN_DIALECTS">Brightbloom is reported to be fluent in seven distinct plant dialects and is considered an accomplished communicator by other guides.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GUIDES_USE_VINES_FOR_EXTRACTION_AND_SUPPORT">Streamwalker (and likely similar mobile guides) can extend vines to wrap around and support a traveler's weight, using them to steady and extract a traveler from a wetland collapse.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_WETLAND_COLLAPSE_FREQUENCY_EVERY_3_TO_4_TRAVELERS">Guides state that footing collapses in the wetlands occur with some regularity — approximately every third or fourth traveler experiences such a collapse — establishing the hazard as common rather than rare.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_TRUST_IN_GUIDES_INCREASED">Kira Voss experiences a qualitative change in confidence/trust: she now trusts the guides' instructions instinctively during hazards and recognizes personal growth in travel competence (less anxious, more willing to follow guidance).</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: The passage opens explicitly with “The second morning starts…,” placing its start the morning after the previous passage’s evening shelter. The passage then follows a single day of travel: morning walking through increasingly wet terrain, a midday/early-afternoon mishap (leg sinking into the mud) that is resolved in minutes, continued walking through afternoon wetlands, and arrival at an evening raised-platform shelter where they settle for the night and discuss plans for “tomorrow.” How much time passes: roughly one daytime period — from morning departure to evening arrival — so on the order of 10–12 hours. When it ends: at evening, when they reach and settle on the raised platform. Gap from previous passage: the previous passage ended at ~20:00 (evening). This passage starts the next morning, so an overnight gap (sleep, drying clothes, morning preparations) of roughly 10–12 hours. Plausibility: The gap and the day’s timeline are plausible. Overnight rest and morning departure explain the time between passages. The muddy collapse and its multi-minute rescue fit within the same day; subsequent walking through afternoon wetlands and reaching a shelter by evening is reasonable for a day’s trek. No contradictory time markers are present.</reasoning>
    <starts>~08:00 (second morning, approximate)</starts>
    <ends>~19:00 (evening, approximate)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~12 hours (overnight). Likely activities during gap: drying clothes, eating, sleeping, morning preparations and setting out. (Previous passage ended ~20:00; this passage begins the following morning.)</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. An overnight gap between an evening shelter and the “second morning” is appropriate and explains the transition. The sinking incident is resolved quickly and is consistent with a minutes-long event within a single day of travel; walking through morning and afternoon wetlands and reaching another shelter by evening fits typical travel pacing and the characters’ described actions.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present in the passage were identified by name and matched to the available character cards. Brightbloom, Streamwalker, Scout, Buddy, and the narrator (Kira Voss) actively appear in the scene (speaking, acting, or being acted on). Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are referenced explicitly (compared to the current guides), so they count as present in the passage (mentioned briefly). No new characters enter during this passage — the characters who appear were already part of the travel group at the end of the previous passage — and no character shown to be present at the start leaves before the passage ends, so the ENTERED and EXITED lists are empty. The only relevant entity/location named (the planetary/territory context) is the Sector 7-Gamma-412 planet entity provided in the available entities list.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage introduces how wetland plants communicate (chemical signals through water and multi-layered floral signaling) and shows Brightbloom demonstrating those signals. It advances the travel plot: while crossing saturated ground Kira's left leg collapses into a hidden swamp hole, Streamwalker instructs her to stay still and uses vines to extract her; Buddy records elevated vitals but Kira is uninjured. The scene establishes the guides' competence and Kira's growing trust and confidence as a traveler. I consolidated earlier medical/aid details into a single bullet and kept the handoff, river crossing, and ongoing journey, then added the new communication details, the swamp-extraction incident, and the plan to reach Territory Three the next day.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active with limited battery.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and a Scout companion, and filed a relay; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
      - Kira traveled with Territory One guides Leafwhisper and Rootwalker for several days; Buddy and Scout accompanied her and she learned about plant-networked territories.
      - At the Territory One/Two boundary Kira handed off to Territory Two guides Streamwalker (calm, waterlike) and Brightbloom (buoyant); Leafwhisper and Rootwalker departed.
      - They encountered and crossed a ~20 m river using submerged stones maintained by the plant network; Scout crossed confidently and Kira followed Streamwalker's guidance successfully.
      - Deeper in the wetlands Brightbloom explains and demonstrates plant communication: waterborne chemical signals carry messages between plants; flowers use color, scent and petal-pattern sequences to encode signals (examples shown: 'safe path ahead' and 'water nearby').
      - Scout tests the water-communication system by splashing; Brightbloom and Streamwalker display a friendly, complementary guide dynamic and multilingual plant-communication skills.
      - While traversing saturated ground Kira's left leg collapses into a hidden swamp hole to mid-thigh; Streamwalker instructs her to stay still and uses vines to pull her free; Buddy logs elevated heart rate but Kira is uninjured aside from being muddy.
      - Kira realizes she has grown more confident and learned to trust guides; the group continues and reaches a raised-reed shelter by evening.
      - Guides say the next day will be their last together before reaching the Territory Three boundary and meeting new guides; Brightbloom expresses attachment to travelers.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV emotional arc: The scene opens in light curiosity and sensory wonder as Kira asks about water-plant communication and watches Brightbloom's demonstrations — she is engaged, delighted, and intellectually stimulated. That wonder is abruptly punctured by a visceral moment of danger when her boot collapses into the swamp: immediate panic, helplessness in the body, and a spike of adrenaline. The guides' calm, routine competence resolves that panic into sharp relief, and the moment turns inward: Kira notices she trusted the guides without second-guessing and feels a quiet pride in her own growth and belonging to the traveling rhythm. Reader experience: readers move with Kira — curious and uplifted by the alien biology, startled and viscerally anxious during the collapse, then soothed and warmed by the competent rescue and Kira's emotional realization. Multiple emotional beats: there are three clear beats (wonder/curiosity → acute tension/panic → relief/trust/belonging) rather than a single dominant tone. Comparison to prior pattern: this passage reproduces the story's recurring micro-arc (anticipation/wonder → threat/tension → acceptance/relief) but shifts emphasis toward interpersonal trust and personal growth (belonging) rather than bureaucratic frustration or procedural stakes. The repetition feels purposeful and refreshing here: the familiar arc is used to show Kira's increasing competence and attachment to her guides rather than to stall the plot. Overall the passage advances emotional development (trust and agency) while maintaining the story's cadence of wonder interrupted by threat and then healed by community.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="wonder">POV: Curious, delighted engagement — Kira's questions about water-plant communication and Brightbloom's blooming patterns produce genuine astonishment and intellectual pleasure. Cause: vivid sensory explanations (flower patterns, chemical signaling) and charming guide personalities. Reader: uplifted curiosity and sensory interest; the scene invites fascination with the alien ecology and deepens emotional investment through tactile detail and playful guide dynamics.</beat>
      <beat tags="tension">POV: Sudden physical alarm and panic when Kira's left foot collapses into the swamp — immediate fear, loss of footing, and a rush of adrenaline tempered only by instructions from the guides. Cause: an abrupt, bodily threat (leg sinking) that exposes vulnerability and the risk of being trapped. Reader: visceral anxiety and suspense, empathizing with the embodied danger and fearing the potential for injury or longer delay.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, belonging">POV: Rapid relief transitioning into a warm recognition of trust and growth — Streamwalker's calm extraction and the guides' matter-of-fact reassurance make Kira feel safe, competent, and quietly proud of her own ability to follow, trust, and adapt. Cause: effective, routine rescue and the internal realization 'I'd trusted the guides' that marks emotional development. Reader: soothed and warmly satisfied; the rescue provides emotional payoff and a sense that Kira is becoming part of a temporary, caring team. Pattern note: this continues the story's familiar threat→resolution arc but pivots emotionally toward belonging and agency rather than procedural delay.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage reinforces the worldbuilding of Territory Two (wetland communication, maintained crossings, guide relay) while introducing concrete, actionable local dangers and tools (deceptive ground, guide extraction technique, floral signalling). I treated explicit in-world claims stated and demonstrated as firm narrative promises (e.g., ground collapse as a real hazard; Brightbloom's bloom-pattern signalling demonstrated), and softer implications about character trajectory (Kira's growing trust/confidence) as tentative. I only marked prior open items as fulfilled where the text explicitly resolved or demonstrated the promised fact (documentation use / arrival at shelter). I lapsed older, tentative speculative threads only where they had not been reinforced and were both tentative and several passages old. Most large, structural mysteries (crash coordinates, SAM, navigation failure, long-term survival, integration questions, living architecture, purification network, etc.) remain open because nothing in this passage resolves them — many are explicitly reinforced (guide relay, Scout bonding, Buddy's presence, maintained network hints), while others are not addressed but remain relevant to the ongoing arc.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="STREAMWALKER_DOCUMENTATION_REINFORCES_COORDINATION">Brightbloom explicitly reports Territory One guides sent documentation about Kira and Streamwalker/Brightbloom act on that knowledge, confirming inter-territorial documentation is reviewed and used.</promise>
      <promise id="TIME_TO_SHELTER_THREE_HOURS">The earlier stated logistical beat about reaching evening shelter (three hours) was realized in the travel sequence across the day(s) and shelter arrival is again shown, closing that immediate timing expectation.</promise>

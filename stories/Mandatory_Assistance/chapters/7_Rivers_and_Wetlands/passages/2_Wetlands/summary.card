  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>At the end of the passage the group has completed a day of travel through progressively wetter wetlands and arrived at a raised reed platform shelter in the evening. Characters present: Kira, Streamwalker (vine-like guide), Brightbloom (flowering bush guide), Scout (small bouncy companion) and Buddy (monitoring assistant). The terrain is waterlogged: spongy, squelchy ground with standing pools, channels, reed clusters and deceptive raised patches/stone paths—one patch collapsed beneath Kira earlier. Streamwalker physically intervened: their vines extended and pulled Kira free, demonstrating that vines can bear weight and be used as rescue tools. Kira’s left leg/clothing are muddy and waterlogged; Kira has just removed a boot and dumped swamp water onto the shelter platform. No injuries are reported. Brightbloom’s flowers are actively opening/closing and glowing as signals; Scout continues to investigate pools and plants. Weather/time: evening sun has warmed damp clothes earlier, now a gentle breeze moves tall purple reeds around the settled shelter. The planned route continues: tomorrow morning they will walk into deeper wetlands and expect to reach the Territory Three boundary by afternoon. These are the physical facts that could affect future scenes: soft, unreliable ground with collapse risk; presence of submerged stone paths that are sometimes stable; functional rescue capability of Streamwalker’s vines; wet, muddy gear on Kira; active plant-signaling behavior; raised platforms for nightly shelter; and a known schedule/distance to the next boundary.</reasoning>
    <state>It is evening on a raised woven-reed platform shelter surrounded by tall purple reeds and gentle breeze. Kira, Streamwalker (vine-like), Brightbloom (flowering bush), Scout and Buddy are present. The surrounding wetlands are very waterlogged and squelchy with standing pools, reed clusters, deceptive raised patches and submerged stone crossings; one patch collapsed under Kira earlier. Streamwalker’s vines are functional and able to support and extract a trapped traveler. Kira’s left leg, pants and boot are mud-caked and waterlogged; Kira has just removed and emptied a boot onto the platform and is damp but uninjured. Brightbloom’s flowers actively open/close and glow as signals; Scout inspects nearby plants. No gear is lost; Buddy continues to monitor vitals. The party will continue deeper into the wetlands tomorrow and expects to reach the Territory Three boundary by afternoon.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage deepens the wetland setting and the guide dynamics, demonstrating several previously hinted behaviors (guide rescue, water-based communication) and introducing concrete mechanics (flower-pattern signaling, routine footing-collapse tests, scheduled handoff to Territory Three). I treated “fulfilled” as narrative setups from the previous open-promises list that the passage paid off by showing or specifying them; I treated nothing here as abandoned (no prior open plotline was rendered moot). Many earlier logistical/mission threads (ship failure, SAM, beacon, etc.) remain untouched and thus carried forward. New promises are focused on wetland communication protocols, the territory’s intentional testing of travelers, Streamwalker’s extraction capability as an explicit rescue procedure, and the imminent boundary/handoff to Territory Three.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="PREVIOUS_TRAVELER_INCIDENT_HINT__UNDISCLOSED_RISK">Brightbloom's earlier throwaway reference to a past incident is clarified: collapses and panic do occur (Streamwalker: 'Every third or fourth traveler'); an example (panicking traveler chest-deep, 20-minute extraction) and routine extraction procedures are described, reducing the earlier vagueness.</promise>
      <promise id="GUIDE_TRUST_BUILDING_EFFECT__KIRA_CONFIDENCE">Kira's trust-building with new guides, set up previously by the river crossing, is realized here: she explicitly trusts Streamwalker's instructions during the collapse, remains calm, and recognizes personal growth in trusting guides and process.</promise>
      <promise id="STREAMWALKER_WATER_SPECIALIZATION__NAVIGATION_SKILL">Streamwalker's specialized water skills are demonstrated again and extended: they test footing, identify deceptive ground, and execute a controlled vine-based extraction to free Kira—paying off the earlier setup of Streamwalker's water navigation/rescue capability.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only facts from the passage that are significant for future continuity (communication methods, guide capabilities, travel risk frequency, and a lasting change in Kira's attitude). I excluded transient scene details (mud on clothes, immediate actions) and items already captured in the provided summary. No elements in the passage contradict previously established facts; the new facts expand on how wetland/plant communication and guide behavior work and record Kira's demonstrable increase in trust of guides.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="WATER_PLANT_COMMUNICATION_VIA_WATER_CHEMICALS">Plants in the wetlands communicate by releasing specific chemical compounds into water currents; the water carries these compounds to neighbors which interpret the chemical composition as messages.</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_FLOWER_COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS">Brightbloom's flowers use multilayered signals—color for visible mood, scent for chemical information, and petal-pattern sequences that encode specific messages (e.g., a sequence meaning 'safe path ahead' or 'water nearby, approach with awareness').</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_VISUAL_SIGNALS_TARGET_MOBILE_GUIDES">Visual flower-pattern signals are primarily intended for mobile/visual observers (guides or mobile companions); rooted plants rely more on scent-based communication.</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_DIALECTS_SEVEN">Brightbloom is fluent in seven plant dialects and is described as an accomplished communicator across those dialects.</fact>
      <fact id="STREAMWALKER_DIALECTS_SEVEN">Streamwalker is implied to know as many plant dialects as Brightbloom (i.e., approximately seven dialects) and communicates using musical tones/harmonics.</fact>
      <fact id="WETLANDS_TEST_FOOTING_FREQUENCY">Wetland footing collapses are common enough to be characterized as occurring roughly for every third or fourth traveler; guides treat such collapses as routine tests of footing.</fact>
      <fact id="STREAMWALKER_VINES_CAN_EXTRACT_TRAVELERS">Streamwalker's vines can extend, secure an arm, take weight, and lift a trapped traveler out of a swallowed patch of bog—i.e., they can perform a safe extraction/rescue maneuver.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_TRUSTS_GUIDES">Kira's attitude toward the guides has shifted from anxious uncertainty to active trust—when her leg collapsed she followed instructions without hesitation, indicating a durable behavioral/attitudinal change that will affect future interactions.</fact>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the current passage: it opens with "The second morning starts with questions," so this scene begins the morning after the previous evening shelter. The passage moves through daytime events (walking, a sinking incident, settling into a walking rhythm, midday sun warming damp clothes) and closes with "By evening they reach another raised platform shelter," plus lines about "Tomorrow's our last day together—we'll reach the boundary by afternoon." 

      From the quoted previous-passage metadata the previous passage ended ~20:15. That makes the current passage the next morning, after an overnight rest. The passage’s internal timeline spans most of that day: morning departure, mid- or late-morning sinking incident, the rest of daytime walking (sun getting stronger), and arrival at evening shelter.

      Estimated durations: overnight rest between passages roughly 11–12 hours; the day of travel in this passage runs roughly from early morning to evening (on the order of ~12 hours of wakeful travel, including pauses).

      No explicit clock-times are given in-text, so start and end times are approximate and based on typical day/night cycles and the provided previous-ending-time.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>~07:30</starts>
    <ends>~19:30</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈11 hours 15 minutes (previous ended ~20:15 → this begins next morning ~07:30). Likely activities during the gap: drying clothes where possible, sleeping/overnight rest on the raised platform, morning preparation and packing, brief morning warmup before setting out.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. An ~11–12 hour overnight gap between an evening shelter and the next morning is normal and fits the "second morning" cue. A full-day of walking from morning through evening (roughly ~12 hours of daytime activity) easily accommodates the events described: careful wetland travel, the sinking-and-rescue incident, drying/wringing clothes, frequent guide-led route-testing, and reaching another shelter by evening. There are no obvious contradictions with the previous passage’s timeline (the earlier river crossing and three-hour segment happened the prior day). The passage’s pacing—one major incident (leg collapse) amid steady travel—fits into a single travel day and is believable for this setting.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters explicitly present or mentioned in the passage: Kira (the first-person narrator), Buddy, Streamwalker, Brightbloom, and Scout are actively present and interacting in the scene. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are mentioned by name (comparisons and reminiscing), so they count as appearing in the passage even though they're not actively in the scene. No new characters arrive during this passage (everyone who appears was already present at the scene's start), and no characters who were present at the start leave before the passage ends, so ENTERED and EXITED are empty. No specific named entity from the provided entity list is referenced in the text, so ENTITIES is empty.</reasoning>

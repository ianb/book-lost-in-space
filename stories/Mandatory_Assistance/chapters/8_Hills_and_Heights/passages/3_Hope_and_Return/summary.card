  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage mostly elaborates on Elder Heartwood's method and provides illustrative historical examples, plus a near-term travel status update. Significant, long-term facts that matter going forward: Elder Heartwood reframes problems into system-level solutions (important for expectations about the forthcoming answer), Elder Heartwood can accelerate responses when matters are critical (affects rescue/priority expectations), two concrete historical interventions that demonstrate Elder Heartwood's effectiveness (mineral-restoration and boundary-collaboration cases), and that Kira expects the current travel to finish in six days (fifteen days total) which updates the immediate timeline for when she will be back at the facility and begin waiting for a reply. I do not mark routine, transient details (Oakshade being quiet this morning, Scout bouncing, dinner, campsite specifics) because they are scene-level and not necessary for long-term continuity. I also do not flag as conflicts a few ambiguous timing differences (estimates vs. actual travel days) because prior entries contain estimates and various day-counts; nothing in this passage clearly contradicts an established, immutable fact. If the story later fixes an exact canonical day count that conflicts with the 'fifteen days total' statement, that would become a true contradiction to flag then.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_REFRAMES_QUESTIONS">Elder Heartwood habitually reframes presented questions and provides system-level frameworks and cross-system guidance rather than merely listing immediate requirements.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_ACCELERATED_RESPONSE_FOR_CRITICAL_ISSUES">Elder Heartwood recognizes timing and can deliver faster responses when a matter is judged to be critical (guides assert critical issues receive accelerated consideration).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_EXAMPLE_MINERAL_RENEWAL">Seventeen seasons ago Elder Heartwood considered a Territory Seven mineral-depletion question for about three months and provided a systemic plan (water flow, root distribution, microbial partnerships) that restored the territory's health.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_EXAMPLE_BOUNDARY_COLLABORATION">Twelve seasons ago Elder Heartwood advised two territories in a boundary dispute to collaborate and share maintenance/resources by need rather than divide, transforming their approach to boundaries.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_PROGRESS_NINE_DAYS_SIX_REMAIN_TOTAL_15">Kira reports she has been traveling for nine days and expects six more days of travel, making this trip's total approximately fifteen days (return to facility in ~6 days).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_ANSWER_BENEFITS_NETWORK">The guides state that Elder Heartwood's solutions are distributable: an answer about how to care for humans will create understanding and benefits that propagate across many territories, not only to Kira.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: it opens with "this morning," then describes descent, walking "through the afternoon," reaching an "evening campsite," watching sunset and stars, and finally falling asleep and planning to leave "tomorrow." Those markers indicate the passage spans a single daytime period from morning to night. The previous passage was pegged to ~16:00 the same day (afternoon/evening) when they left the presenting ground. The current passage therefore begins the following morning and runs through that day into night. Approximate durations: the passage covers roughly a full day of travel (morning → afternoon → evening → sleep). The gap between passages is an overnight interval spent camping; this is consistent with the group's prior pattern of camping and the explicit campsite description in this passage. No major timing contradictions appear—the travel distances and activities (a day of descent/route-following, afternoon walking, setting up camp, evening rest) are plausible within a single day.</reasoning>
    <starts>morning (~07:30)</starts>
    <ends>night (~21:30)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~15.5 hours (previous ended ~16:00; passage begins the next morning). Likely spent overnight camping; resumed descent and a day of walking.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The overnight gap explains the shift from an afternoon/evening scene at Elder Heartwood to "this morning." A full day of downhill hiking, afternoon travel, and reaching camp by evening fits the characters' described activities and energy levels. No implausible time compression (e.g., impossible distances or actions crammed into too-short intervals) is evident.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>I identified characters who are named or referenced in the passage and matched them to the provided available-character list. The narrator (Kira Voss) is present throughout. Scout and Buddy are explicitly present and active. Elder Heartwood is repeatedly discussed. Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Streamwalker, and Brightbloom are mentioned as guides for the return trip. Oakshade and Mossmantle are also present in the passage, but they are not in the provided available-character list, so I did not include them as card paths. No new available-list characters enter during the scene, and none of the available-list characters present at the start leave before the passage ends. No entities from the provided entity list are explicitly referenced in this passage.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage primarily records the return journey from the Elder Heartwood, clarification of Elder Heartwood's deliberation style (weeks-to-seasons) with illustrative past cases, Kira's measurable personal growth, Buddy's analytical interest, and the planned return timeline and remaining guides. I consolidated earlier granular travel details into a single concise trek bullet, added the new information about Elder Heartwood reframing problems and giving systemic answers (with two example cases), noted Buddy's analysis and Scout's optimism, and updated the timeline (15 days total, ~6 days remaining) and upcoming guides. I removed atmospheric or purely descriptive details that don't affect plot or future actions.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI "Buddy" is active but battery-limited.
      - Shuttle hull breached but planet atmosphere is breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon are damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
      - Kira undertook a guided, multi-territory trek with plant guides and Scout, learning plant-networked survival practices and improving stamina, balance, and terrain-reading.
      - During the trek Scout investigated crystalline mineral formations and Kira was rescued from a hidden swamp hole by Streamwalker; those discoveries informed plant context for her question.
      - Kira and guides reached the Elder Heartwood valley; Oakshade formally presented Kira's question—how to care for a human and bridge incompatible plant/human frameworks—and Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt and began deliberation.
      - Oakshade and Mossmantle explained Elder Heartwood deliberates on long timescales (weeks to seasons) but reframes questions systemically; they cited two precedent cases: a mineral-depletion solution (17 seasons ago) and a boundary-dispute solution advocating collaboration (12 seasons ago).
      - Kira began the descent home escorted by Oakshade and Mossmantle; Buddy is analyzing Elder Heartwood's consultation framework and Scout remains optimistic and bonded as Kira's companion.
      - Kira has demonstrable short-term growth—more confident, less hesitant, better at reading terrain—and Scout has matured as a partner.
      - Return plan updated: total round-trip will be about 15 days; roughly six days remain to reach the facility via guides Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker.
      - Plants assert Elder Heartwood prioritizes critical needs and will know to accelerate responses when survival is urgent; its eventual guidance is expected to benefit the broader plant network, not just Kira.
      - Kira and companions camped for the night and will continue the return journey tomorrow; upon returning they will wait for Elder Heartwood's formal answer.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV emotional state: The scene is dominated by a tempered, forward-looking hope anchored in pragmatic confidence. Kira is quietly optimistic that Elder Heartwood can provide the kind of systemic wisdom she needs, energized by Oakshade and Mossmantle’s concrete examples and their assurances that critical matters are prioritized. Alongside that hope is a softer, restorative acceptance: Kira recognizes her own growth (competence, trust, team belonging) and takes comfort in the rhythm of travel and the guides’ companionship. A low-level dread about timing ("months, seasons") persists, but it is quickly reframed into patient acceptance—she chooses to "wait with hope." Buddy and Scout add lightness (curious enthusiasm, optimism) that undercuts anxiety.

      Reader experience: Readers will feel uplifted and reassured—there’s a satisfying emotional payoff to the journey so far (belonging and competence) and genuine curiosity/anticipation about Elder Heartwood’s answer. At the same time, readers retain a quiet, lingering worry about whether the answer will arrive in time; the tension is anticipatory rather than acute. The tone is reflective and hopeful rather than suspenseful.

      Multiple beats or dominant tone: There are three overlapping beats: hopeful anticipation about Elder Heartwood’s capacity and answer; warm belonging/acceptance as Kira recognizes personal growth and team cohesion; and a muted dread about slow timelines that resolves into patient acceptance. The dominant tone is hopeful/anticipatory with an undercurrent of acceptance.

      Comparison with story pattern so far: This continues the story’s recurring anticipation→dread→acceptance arc, but shifts emphasis. Earlier beats featured sharper, often frantic dread and bureaucratic frustration; here the dread is softer (timing concerns) and is balanced by genuine belonging and confidence gained on the journey. The pattern repeats thematically but feels like emotional growth rather than redundancy—the bureaucratic frustration has been replaced by constructive hope and trust in an ancient wisdom.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Cautious, energized optimism—Kira feels that Elder Heartwood is capable of reframing the survival question and providing a systemic, usable answer. Cause: Oakshade/Mossmantle’s concrete success stories, the ritual presentation, and the sense of having reached a true authority. Reader: experiences uplifted curiosity and invested anticipation—relief that there may be an actual solution and eagerness to learn what it will be.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: Warm, settled belonging and quiet acceptance—Kira recognizes real personal growth (confidence, rhythm, trust in guides) and feels part of a team with Scout, Buddy, and the plant-guides. Cause: reflection on nine days of cumulative learning, shared routines, and affectionate small moments (Scout nudges, Buddy’s enthusiasm). Reader: feels reassurance and emotional satisfaction; this functions as a restorative, consoling beat after earlier trauma.</beat>
      <beat tags="dread, acceptance">POV: Low-level dread about timing ("months, seasons")—the prospect that Elder Heartwood’s deliberation could be too slow—tempered into patient acceptance when the guides insist that critical cases are prioritized. Cause: explicit talk of seasons/timeframes and Oakshade/Mossmantle’s assurances that critical issues accelerate response. Reader: retains mild anxiety about survival timelines but is calmed by the characters’ faith and Kira’s decision to wait with hope. Pattern note: This repeats the story’s anticipation→dread→acceptance motif but in a gentler, more grown form rather than an acute crisis.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      Summary of what happened in this passage and how it affects outstanding narrative promises:

      - The passage mostly reinforces earlier setups rather than resolving them. Kira returns from the presenting ground, resumes travel, and explicitly plans to wait for Elder Heartwood's answer. That action directly fulfills the short-term logistical promise that Kira would return to her life and wait while the Elder considered the question.

      - Elder Heartwood's deliberation remains explicitly pending and framed as taking weeks/months/seasons; the story reiterates that timing and the Elder's tendency to reframe systemic problems rather than give quick, narrow fixes. Therefore the firm promises around the Elder's capability and the delay remain open.

      - The passage introduces a few new, concrete narrative commitments: (1) the claim that Elder Heartwood prioritizes critical cases and can speed answers when survival is at stake; (2) the idea that Elder's answer will benefit the wider network / multiple territories (transferability of the solution); and (3) a concrete travel/timeline detail (the full journey timing: ~15 days total). I mark the first and third as firm because guides present them as established procedural facts (how Elder operates; explicit schedule), and the network-benefit claim as tentative because it's plausible but is an extrapolation of the guides' confidence rather than a guaranteed narrative payoff.

      - Nothing in this passage resolves the larger mysteries (shuttle coordinate mismatch, navigation failure, SAM, damaged shuttle as shelter, etc.), so those earlier open promises remain live. I found no clear contradictions that would force any prior open promise to lapse; most tentative items were reinforced (e.g., plant signalling/maintenance, Kira's increased competence, Buddy's continuing supportive presence). Therefore I mark those prior items as still open.

      Decisions made:
      - Fulfilled: YOU_RETURN_AND_WAIT — Kira returns and resumes life/waiting as previously instructed.
      - Lapsed: none — no prior open promise is contradicted or abandoned explicitly here.
      - Carried forward: everything else from the previous open-promises list, unchanged in status, with tentative flags preserved where originally marked.
      - New promises introduced: ELDER_PRIORITY_CRITICAL_CASES (firm), ELDER_ANSWER_NETWORK_BENEFIT (tentative), RETURN_TRIP_SCHEDULE_15_DAYS (firm).

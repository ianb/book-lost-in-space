      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          This passage is largely a consolidation/return beat after the Elder Heartwood presentation: characters descend, reflect on examples of Elder Heartwood's past answers, tighten the travel timeline, and commit to returning home and waiting. I treated any explicit on-screen action as fulfillment (e.g., Kira actually returns toward home/campsite). When dialogue or narration contradicted an earlier explicit setup (a previous specific timeline), I marked that setup as lapsed. Soft, ongoing threads (medical, navigation, cargo, life support, plant-network issues, language practice, Buddy's studies, skill growth) were neither resolved nor contradicted, so I carried them forward. I also flagged a few new, explicit narrative promises introduced here (explicit travel durations; the claim that Elder Heartwood can accelerate if something is critical; the suggestion that the eventual guidance will have network-level impact; Buddy's renewed analytic interest) and labelled them tentative or firm according to how directly they were stated and how narratively consequential they are.

          Key decisions:
          - Fulfilled: Kira does in fact return toward home/wait (KIRA_WILL_RETURN_AND_WAIT_FOR_ELDER_RESPONSE) and the campsite promise was directly demonstrated (TERRITORY_THREE_MAINTAINED_CAMPSITE_AVAILABLE [tentative]).
          - Lapsed: Two prior concrete timeframe estimates were contradicted/superseded by the passage (ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_8_12_WEEKS is contradicted by months/seasons language; TRAVEL_TIME_ESTIMATE_25_DAYS is superseded by the explicit "Fifteen days total" now reported).
          - Carried forward: All logistical, medical, investigation, and cultural-learning threads that remain relevant to future scenes (bio-samples, life support, rescue estimates, plant misinterpretation risk, shared-network properties, Buddy/Florence/Remedy tasks, language practice, etc.).

          I focused on not marking as fulfilled any promise that is ongoing progress rather than closure (e.g., Scout communication, Buddy's cataloging, long-term food safety), and I only lapsed promises where the passage gave contradictory or superseding information.

        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="KIRA_WILL_RETURN_AND_WAIT_FOR_ELDER_RESPONSE">Kira follows the instruction to return toward home and to wait while Elder Heartwood considers the presented question; the passage shows the journey home beginning and the explicit decision to wait.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I filtered for details that matter long-term: recurring abilities/skills, institutional/history facts about Elder Heartwood that could be referenced later, and any changes to travel timing that would affect schedules and expectations. I excluded momentary descriptions, mood, and repeated facts already established (Kira's improved confidence, Scout accompaniment, guides' identities, etc.). I flagged one clear contradiction: earlier canonical estimate for the route was ~21 days, while this passage states a 15-day total for the journey. I treated Elder Heartwood examples and the statement that Elder Heartwood can accelerate responses for critical cases as new long-term facts because they expand the collective's capabilities and precedent.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="SCOUT_CONTROLLED_ROLLING">Scout has developed a refined skill at controlled rolling/hopping on slopes and uses momentum deliberately to traverse hills safely.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_MINERAL_RENEWAL_17_SEASONS_AGO">Seventeen seasons ago Elder Heartwood considered a Territory Seven mineral-depletion problem for about three months and provided a systems-level solution (water flow, root distribution, microbial partnerships) that restored long-term soil health.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_BOUNDARY_COLLABORATION_12_SEASONS_AGO">Twelve seasons ago Elder Heartwood resolved a boundary dispute between two territories by advising collaboration and joint maintenance agreements, changing how boundaries and shared resources were managed.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_EXPEDITES_ON_CRITICAL_CASES">Oakshade and Mossmantle assert that Elder Heartwood can and will deliver faster responses when an issue is judged critical (e.g., an individual's imminent survival), i.e., timing can be accelerated under urgent circumstances.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_DURATION_15_DAYS">The journey (round-trip / full itinerary described here) is reported in-scene as taking approximately fifteen days total.</fact>

        <conflicts>
          <conflict id="TRAVEL_DURATION_CONFLICT" with-fact="CHANGE_TRAVEL_TRAVEL_TIME_ESTIMATE_21_DAYS">Previously: Holloway estimated the route itself would take ~21 days (˜25 days including prep). This passage states the 'full journey' will be about fifteen days total. These two travel-duration claims contradict each other.</conflict>
        </conflicts>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The previous passage ends at the authoritative time 2687-03-28T17:00. The current passage opens with morning imagery (“Oakshade is quiet this morning,” discussion of descent and walking through the afternoon) and closes with an evening campsite and the narrator falling asleep under the stars. That indicates the passage covers a single travel day: morning → afternoon → evening. The narrator refers to the overall journey totals (nine days so far, fifteen days total planned), which matches earlier mentions and is consistent with this being one day of the return trip. The most reasonable reading is that the group camped overnight after the previous passage and resumed travel the next morning. The gap between passages is therefore an overnight rest plus early-morning start. The time allocations (start in the morning, many hours of walking through afternoon, evening camp and sleep) are plausible for the activities described.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-03-29T08:00 (approx)</starts>
        <ends>2687-03-29T21:30 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>≈15 hours (previous ended 2687-03-28T17:00; current starts the next morning). Likely spent making camp, sleeping/resting, breaking camp, and beginning descent in the morning.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. An overnight rest followed by a day of descent and several hours of walking fits the narrative beats (morning quiet, walking through afternoon, reaching evening campsite). The distances implied and the schedule (one travel day from morning to night) are reasonable for a guided walking party. The internal timeline (nine days elapsed so far, six more days to finish for a total of fifteen) is consistent across passages. No obvious timing contradictions are present.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>
          Baseline: characters present at the end of the previous passage were Kira_Voss, Scout, Buddy, and Elder_Heartwood. I scanned the passage for all available characters (from the provided list) who are either present or mentioned. Present: Kira (narrator), Scout (physically with Kira), Buddy (communicates in Kira's mind), and Elder Heartwood (explicitly referenced as the recipient of the question). The passage also names upcoming/future guides Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker; they are mentioned in the scene and thus count as appearing. Oakshade and Mossmantle are physically present in the passage but are not in the provided available-characters list, so they are not listed here.

          Entered: Using the previous-present list as the scene-start baseline, Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker were not in the previous-present list and appear (are mentioned) during this passage, so they are treated as having entered the scene for the purposes of this analysis.

          Exited: Of the four characters who were present at the end of the previous passage, Kira, Scout, and Buddy are still physically present at the end of this passage. Elder_Heartwood was present previously but is not part of the traveling camp in this passage (they are only referred to), so I mark Elder_Heartwood as having exited between the two passages.

          Entities: The passage mentions territories and a facility but does not reference either of the two provided entity cards explicitly, so no entity card paths are listed.

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage mainly continues the aftermath of Kira's presentation to Elder Heartwood and the return journey. Key additions: the guides explain Elder Heartwood's deliberation timeline and systemic framing approach (answers reframe problems and can be faster for critical issues); Buddy is analyzing the tree's consultation framework; Kira notes personal growth and team cohesion with Scout; the party begins the descent and plans the return route and timetable (six more days, 15 days total). I consolidated earlier travel and presentation details into fewer bullets to keep the running summary focused and removed atmospheric specifics that aren't plot-relevant.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (Scout, territory guides, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle was used as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
          - Kira formally petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove and received inter-territorial travel approval; Buddy and Scout accompanied her.
          - Kira traveled nine days through three territories with successive guides (including Leafwhisper/Rootwalker; Streamwalker/Brightbloom; Oakshade/Mossmantle) and was presented at Elder Heartwood’s grounds.
          - At the presenting ground Oakshade asked how to care for a human and bridge incompatible frameworks; Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt and will deliberate on a seasonal timescale; delegates advised Kira to return home while it considers the question.
          - Oakshade and Mossmantle explained Elder Heartwood’s process: it reframes questions to address systemic patterns, provides comprehensive multi-scale guidance, and will prioritize faster responses when matters are critical.
          - Buddy has started analyzing Elder Heartwood’s consultation framework—interested in its distributed, temporal knowledge-processing across root and symbiotic networks.
          - Kira has visibly grown more confident, resilient, and skilled at navigating terrain after the journey; Scout and Kira have formed a cooperative team.
          - The party began the descent and will retrace their route home (Streamwalker/Brightbloom then Leafwhisper/Rootwalker); the full trip is expected to total ~15 days, with ~6 days remaining to return to the facility.
          - Kira and the plant collective recognize that Elder Heartwood’s forthcoming guidance could create broadly applicable cross-framework care knowledge for many territories.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues: active Biological Samples container still active, SAM still offline, external communications/distress beacon still broken, and Elder Heartwood’s full guidance remains pending.

        <reasoning>This passage is a contemplative, low-tension moment that balances quiet hope with lingering vulnerability. Kira is primarily reflective and cautiously optimistic: she trusts her guides' certainty about Elder Heartwood and takes comfort from concrete evidence of her own progress (better footing, reading terrain, trusting rhythm). At the same time she feels the underlying anxiety that practical survival still depends on Elder Heartwood's answer—so competence and confidence coexist with vulnerability and a waiting dread at the edges. The reader experiences reassurance (the plants are competent and take the question seriously), warmth (team cohesion, Scout's closeness, Buddy's earnestness), and a gentle forward momentum rather than spike-level suspense. There are multiple emotional beats here—reassuring certainty about Elder Heartwood; personal consolidation of Kira's growth; and an expanding sense of meaning as Kira realizes the answer will help more than just her—but the dominant tone is quiet hope/acceptance tempered by lingering vulnerability. Compared with the story so far, this is a consolidation beat: earlier arcs pushed Kira from shock into trust and active agency; here that arc is visible and acknowledged rather than newly launched. There are no real surprises—the passage supplies confirmation and reflection rather than new twists. Character growth is explicit: Kira recognizes measurable changes in skill, confidence, and trust; Scout registers reciprocal growth in partnership. Buddy's curiosity is present but consistent with prior behavior and not surprising.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="hope, acceptance">POV: Kira feels cautious optimism and a steadying acceptance as Oakshade and Mossmantle describe Elder Heartwood's past successes and express absolute confidence in its broader perspective. The reassurance comes from the guides' certainty that the tree reframes problems rather than offering checklist fixes. Reader: feels calmed and uplifted—this beat turns institutional uncertainty into credible hope by invoking historical precedent.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, vulnerability">POV: Mixed pride and lingering anxiety as Kira recognizes concrete personal growth (better footing, faster decisions, trust in rhythm) yet admits those skills don't solve the fundamental survival mismatch—she's competent but still dependent on Elder Heartwood's bridge. Reader: admires Kira's development while sensing the unresolved stakes; the emotional tone is steady determination underscored by quiet vulnerability.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, wonder">POV: A widening sense of meaning as Kira realizes an Elder Heartwood solution would not only save her but create cross-framework knowledge for the whole network; this lifts the moment from personal survival to communal significance. Reader: experiences an elegiac uplift—what began as an individual rescue becomes a potentially transformative, wonder-filled outcome for many.</beat>

      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>They have descended from the valley and left Elder Heartwood’s presenting ground; the ancient tree remains back in the valley still considering the question (response expected in weeks-to-seasons). The party is physically together and intact: Kira (human), Scout (companion) who is curled up beside her, and the two plant guides Oakshade and Mossmantle. They have stopped for the evening at a previously used sheltered campsite between rock formations: soft moss patches for bedding, a small spring still trickling, and nearby crystalline rocks and rolling low hills visible from this elevation. It is dusk-to-night (sunset has passed; stars are visible) with clear weather. Kira has eaten evening rations (mushroom paste/nutrient bars), is fatigued but uninjured. Internal companion Buddy is present as a mental/technical presence but not physically manifest. They have a planned route and handoffs: tomorrow they will reach Territory Two’s boundary to meet Streamwalker and Brightbloom, later Leafwhisper and Rootwalker through the forest, and the full journey back to the facility will take about six more days (fifteen days total). No immediate environmental hazards or damage are described.</reasoning>
        <state>Kira, Scout, Oakshade, and Mossmantle are camped at a sheltered evening campsite between rock formations on lower rolling hills. Soft, faintly bioluminescent moss patches and a trickling spring provide bedding and water; crystalline rocks are nearby. It is night with clear skies and visible stars. Kira is tired but uninjured and has eaten evening rations; Scout is curled up beside her. Buddy is active only as an internal presence. Elder Heartwood remains in the distant valley, still considering the presented question (answer expected in weeks-to-seasons). The party plans to continue tomorrow to the Territory Two boundary (to meet Streamwalker and Brightbloom), then on with Leafwhisper and Rootwalker toward the facility—about six more days of travel; no immediate hazards are present.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I compared the previous open-promises list to what the current passage actually resolves, clarifies, or newly introduces. The passage primarily reinforces the uncertainty around Elder Heartwood's ultimate answer and timeline, gives concrete travel timing (the return trip and total journey), and introduces several forward-facing beats (Elder’s potential systemic impact, Buddy’s active analysis, Kira’s measurable maturation). Only one prior open promise is actually resolved/updated into a clear new status (the journey/timeline estimate). Most prior promises remain relevant and unresolved; none are explicitly dropped or abandoned by this passage.</reasoning>

          <promise id="ELDER_FACE_TO_FACE_COMMUNICATION_OUTCOME">(Duplicate/related thread retained) Whether the in-person consultation will produce practical, implementable guidance for cross-framework care remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_ANSWER_WILL_SCALE__SYSTEMIC_SPREAD">(New) The passage introduces that Elder Heartwood’s solution, if found, will likely be framed to apply across territories and could reshape maintenance/governance and cross-framework care.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_PRIORITY_FOR_CRITICAL_ISSUES">(New) The guides assert Elder Heartwood accelerates responses for critical problems—this sets up a promise that Kira's case might be prioritized and delivered faster if deemed urgent.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_ANALYTICAL_INVOLVEMENT_WITH_ELDER">(New) Buddy's active curiosity and analysis of Elder Heartwood’s informational framework suggest Buddy may attempt to model, translate, or otherwise engage with Elder knowledge processing later.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_COMPETENCE_AND_CONFIDENCE_ARC">(New) The passage emphasizes visible short-term growth in Kira's competence, terrain-reading, and decision speed—sets expectation that she will be more capable/agentic going forward.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Include only significant, long-term facts introduced or clarified by the passage. I excluded transient details (camp setup, evening actions, momentary moods) and items already covered in the provided summary/previous facts. The passage supplies precedents and character/world heuristics that could matter later: examples of Elder Heartwood's past interventions (with timescales and outcomes), a generalization about Elder Heartwood's style (reframing/systemic answers), that Elder prioritizes critical cases with faster responses, an explicit total-trip estimate (fifteen days), and Buddy's active analytical interest in plant cognition. No statements in the passage contradict previously established facts, so no conflicts are flagged.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_REFRAMES_QUESTIONS_AND_PROVIDES_SYSTEM_WIDE_SOLUTIONS">Elder Heartwood's answers tend to reframe questions and provide system-level, cross-framework solutions (not just immediate checklists), explaining how to approach underlying systems and interactions.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_HAS_PRECEDENT_MINERAL_RENEWAL_17_SEASONS_AGO_3_MONTHS">Seventeen seasons ago Territory Seven presented a mineral-depletion problem; Elder Heartwood considered the question for three months and then provided a comprehensive framework (water flow, root distribution, microbial partnerships) that restored the territory.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_HAS_PRECEDENT_BOUNDARY_DISPUTE_12_SEASONS_AGO_COLLABORATIVE_SOLUTION">Twelve seasons ago Elder Heartwood resolved a boundary dispute by advising collaboration (joint maintenance agreements, sharing by need), which transformed how territories thought about and managed boundaries.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_EXPEDITES_RESPONSES_WHEN_CRITICAL">Plant guides assert Elder Heartwood accelerates consideration/response timelines when a question is critical to survival—critical cases receive faster attention than routine queries.</fact>
          <fact id="TRIP_TOTAL_ESTIMATED_15_DAYS">The guides estimate the full round-trip journey (outbound + return to the facility) will total about fifteen days.</fact>
          <fact id="BUDDY_ANALYZES_PLANT_COGNITION_FRAMEWORK">Buddy actively models and analyzes Elder Heartwood's consultation/knowledge-processing framework (distributed knowledge processing, temporal data integration) and expresses curiosity about plant cognition.</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_ANSWERS_APPLICABLE_NETWORK_WIDE">Guides emphasize that Elder Heartwood's solution for Kira's human-survival question will be framed to benefit the broader territorial network, not solely the individual petitioner.</fact>

        <reasoning>The passage opens with a morning scene (“Oakshade is quiet this morning”) and then covers a full travel day: walking through morning, afternoon and arriving at an evening campsite with stars visible. The previous passage ended late afternoon/evening (~17:30) after they left the presenting ground and climbed back up toward territory boundaries and the long walk home. That implies an overnight camp between the two passages. The current passage therefore begins the next morning, spans the day as they descend and retrace route, and ends at nightfall when they make camp. The characters discuss timing in-days and seasons (Elder Heartwood thinking in seasons, weeks/months answers), but the concrete events here—an overnight rest, a day of travel, and arriving at the same evening campsite—are internally consistent. The only minor ambiguity is the exact clock times (none are given), but the sequence (evening -&gt; overnight -&gt; next-morning -&gt; evening) is clear and plausible.</reasoning>
        <starts>~07:30 (the next morning)</starts>
        <ends>~20:00 (evening, campsite under stars)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>≈14 hours (overnight). What likely happened: they camped for the night after the late-afternoon/evening events, slept, broke camp, and resumed travel the next morning.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. An overnight gap between the late-afternoon/evening end of the previous passage and a next-morning start is reasonable given they were traveling and would camp. A full day of descent and retracing their path fits the described activities (morning quiet, walking through afternoon, arriving at an evening campsite). The travel distances and timing described (one day of walking covering familiar ground and arriving by night) are believable. No timing contradictions are evident that would make the characters’ actions implausible.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed any available characters who appear or are mentioned in the passage. Oakshade and Mossmantle speak throughout the scene but are not in the provided character list, so they are noted in the reasoning but not included in the output paths. Elder Heartwood is frequently referenced (and was present at the end of the previous passage), so I include that path. Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker are named as upcoming guides later in the passage — they appear after the scene starts, so I mark them as present and as having entered during this passage. No tracked character who is present at the start of this passage then leaves before the end, so EXITED is empty. The passage mentions territories but does not reference the single available entity path directly, so ENTITIES is empty.</reasoning>

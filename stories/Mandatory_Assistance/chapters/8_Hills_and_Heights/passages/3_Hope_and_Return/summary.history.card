      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage is largely confirmation and consolidation rather than resolution. It reiterates that Elder Heartwood has received the question and will deliberate, supplies concrete travel/timetable detail for the return leg, and offers concrete, lived examples of Elder Heartwood's reframing capacity. It does not produce Elder Heartwood's answer or address any wreck/log/sample/AI/system issues introduced earlier, so almost all technical and investigation promises remain open. Fulfilled items are limited to things the passage directly makes concrete or demonstrates (travel-duration refinement, campsite maintenance, and Scout's terrain adaptation). No previous, still-open promise was abandoned or made moot in this passage — nothing contradictory or dropped; therefore there are no lapsed promises. New narrative promises introduced here are about (1) the concretized return-route and timeline, (2) the plants' assertion that Elder Heartwood accelerates answers for critical survival needs (a prioritization promise), and (3) the implication that Elder's answer, if found, will propagate network-wide and change plant-human relations. All other earlier promises remain active and relevant.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_TOTAL_TIMELINE_REFINED">The passage provides a concrete total-duration for the trip (fifteen days total) and details remaining legs (about six more days, specific upcoming guides), which pays off the earlier 'timeline refinement' promise by giving a concrete travel estimate.</promise>
          <promise id="TERRITORY_CAMP_INFRASTRUCTURE">The campsite between rock formations is explicitly described as maintained and ready (moss patches, spring still trickling), demonstrating that territory maintenance/infrastructure for travelers is functioning as previously suggested.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_TERRAIN_ADAPTATION">Scout's behavior (perfected controlled rolling on slopes, confident bouncing) is shown again as improved terrain adaptation, paying off the setup that Scout would continue to adapt and provide mobility benefits.</promise>

          <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_CAN_BRIDGE_FRAMEWORKS">Other plant beings assert Elder Heartwood can connect incompatible systems and provide guidance for 'how to care for a human'; historical examples lend credibility but the human-specific answer remains pending.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_WAIT_IMPACTS_SURVIVAL">The explicit expectation that Elder deliberation will take seasons/weeks/months introduces a narrative tension: delayed wisdom may conflict with immediate survival/resource constraints.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_GROVE_AS_LIVING_ARCHITECTURE">Elder Heartwood functions at valley scale as organism and infrastructure (roots-as-paths, canopy-as-climate); detailed mechanisms remain to be studied.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage mostly elaborates on Elder Heartwood's method and provides illustrative historical examples, plus a near-term travel status update. Significant, long-term facts that matter going forward: Elder Heartwood reframes problems into system-level solutions (important for expectations about the forthcoming answer), Elder Heartwood can accelerate responses when matters are critical (affects rescue/priority expectations), two concrete historical interventions that demonstrate Elder Heartwood's effectiveness (mineral-restoration and boundary-collaboration cases), and that Kira expects the current travel to finish in six days (fifteen days total) which updates the immediate timeline for when she will be back at the facility and begin waiting for a reply. I do not mark routine, transient details (Oakshade being quiet this morning, Scout bouncing, dinner, campsite specifics) because they are scene-level and not necessary for long-term continuity. I also do not flag as conflicts a few ambiguous timing differences (estimates vs. actual travel days) because prior entries contain estimates and various day-counts; nothing in this passage clearly contradicts an established, immutable fact. If the story later fixes an exact canonical day count that conflicts with the 'fifteen days total' statement, that would become a true contradiction to flag then.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_REFRAMES_QUESTIONS">Elder Heartwood habitually reframes presented questions and provides system-level frameworks and cross-system guidance rather than merely listing immediate requirements.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_ACCELERATED_RESPONSE_FOR_CRITICAL_ISSUES">Elder Heartwood recognizes timing and can deliver faster responses when a matter is judged to be critical (guides assert critical issues receive accelerated consideration).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_EXAMPLE_MINERAL_RENEWAL">Seventeen seasons ago Elder Heartwood considered a Territory Seven mineral-depletion question for about three months and provided a systemic plan (water flow, root distribution, microbial partnerships) that restored the territory's health.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_EXAMPLE_BOUNDARY_COLLABORATION">Twelve seasons ago Elder Heartwood advised two territories in a boundary dispute to collaborate and share maintenance/resources by need rather than divide, transforming their approach to boundaries.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_PROGRESS_NINE_DAYS_SIX_REMAIN_TOTAL_15">Kira reports she has been traveling for nine days and expects six more days of travel, making this trip's total approximately fifteen days (return to facility in ~6 days).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_ANSWER_BENEFITS_NETWORK">The guides state that Elder Heartwood's solutions are distributable: an answer about how to care for humans will create understanding and benefits that propagate across many territories, not only to Kira.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: it opens with "this morning," then describes descent, walking "through the afternoon," reaching an "evening campsite," watching sunset and stars, and finally falling asleep and planning to leave "tomorrow." Those markers indicate the passage spans a single daytime period from morning to night. The previous passage was pegged to ~16:00 the same day (afternoon/evening) when they left the presenting ground. The current passage therefore begins the following morning and runs through that day into night. Approximate durations: the passage covers roughly a full day of travel (morning → afternoon → evening → sleep). The gap between passages is an overnight interval spent camping; this is consistent with the group's prior pattern of camping and the explicit campsite description in this passage. No major timing contradictions appear—the travel distances and activities (a day of descent/route-following, afternoon walking, setting up camp, evening rest) are plausible within a single day.</reasoning>
        <starts>morning (~07:30)</starts>
        <ends>night (~21:30)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~15.5 hours (previous ended ~16:00; passage begins the next morning). Likely spent overnight camping; resumed descent and a day of walking.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The overnight gap explains the shift from an afternoon/evening scene at Elder Heartwood to "this morning." A full day of downhill hiking, afternoon travel, and reaching camp by evening fits the characters' described activities and energy levels. No implausible time compression (e.g., impossible distances or actions crammed into too-short intervals) is evident.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I identified characters who are named or referenced in the passage and matched them to the provided available-character list. The narrator (Kira Voss) is present throughout. Scout and Buddy are explicitly present and active. Elder Heartwood is repeatedly discussed. Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Streamwalker, and Brightbloom are mentioned as guides for the return trip. Oakshade and Mossmantle are also present in the passage, but they are not in the provided available-character list, so I did not include them as card paths. No new available-list characters enter during the scene, and none of the available-list characters present at the start leave before the passage ends. No entities from the provided entity list are explicitly referenced in this passage.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage primarily records the return journey from the Elder Heartwood, clarification of Elder Heartwood's deliberation style (weeks-to-seasons) with illustrative past cases, Kira's measurable personal growth, Buddy's analytical interest, and the planned return timeline and remaining guides. I consolidated earlier granular travel details into a single concise trek bullet, added the new information about Elder Heartwood reframing problems and giving systemic answers (with two example cases), noted Buddy's analysis and Scout's optimism, and updated the timeline (15 days total, ~6 days remaining) and upcoming guides. I removed atmospheric or purely descriptive details that don't affect plot or future actions.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI "Buddy" is active but battery-limited.
          - Shuttle hull breached but planet atmosphere is breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon are damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
          - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
          - Kira undertook a guided, multi-territory trek with plant guides and Scout, learning plant-networked survival practices and improving stamina, balance, and terrain-reading.
          - During the trek Scout investigated crystalline mineral formations and Kira was rescued from a hidden swamp hole by Streamwalker; those discoveries informed plant context for her question.
          - Kira and guides reached the Elder Heartwood valley; Oakshade formally presented Kira's question—how to care for a human and bridge incompatible plant/human frameworks—and Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt and began deliberation.
          - Oakshade and Mossmantle explained Elder Heartwood deliberates on long timescales (weeks to seasons) but reframes questions systemically; they cited two precedent cases: a mineral-depletion solution (17 seasons ago) and a boundary-dispute solution advocating collaboration (12 seasons ago).
          - Kira began the descent home escorted by Oakshade and Mossmantle; Buddy is analyzing Elder Heartwood's consultation framework and Scout remains optimistic and bonded as Kira's companion.
          - Kira has demonstrable short-term growth—more confident, less hesitant, better at reading terrain—and Scout has matured as a partner.
          - Return plan updated: total round-trip will be about 15 days; roughly six days remain to reach the facility via guides Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker.
          - Plants assert Elder Heartwood prioritizes critical needs and will know to accelerate responses when survival is urgent; its eventual guidance is expected to benefit the broader plant network, not just Kira.
          - Kira and companions camped for the night and will continue the return journey tomorrow; upon returning they will wait for Elder Heartwood's formal answer.

        <reasoning>
          POV emotional state: The scene is dominated by a tempered, forward-looking hope anchored in pragmatic confidence. Kira is quietly optimistic that Elder Heartwood can provide the kind of systemic wisdom she needs, energized by Oakshade and Mossmantle’s concrete examples and their assurances that critical matters are prioritized. Alongside that hope is a softer, restorative acceptance: Kira recognizes her own growth (competence, trust, team belonging) and takes comfort in the rhythm of travel and the guides’ companionship. A low-level dread about timing ("months, seasons") persists, but it is quickly reframed into patient acceptance—she chooses to "wait with hope." Buddy and Scout add lightness (curious enthusiasm, optimism) that undercuts anxiety.

          Reader experience: Readers will feel uplifted and reassured—there’s a satisfying emotional payoff to the journey so far (belonging and competence) and genuine curiosity/anticipation about Elder Heartwood’s answer. At the same time, readers retain a quiet, lingering worry about whether the answer will arrive in time; the tension is anticipatory rather than acute. The tone is reflective and hopeful rather than suspenseful.

          Multiple beats or dominant tone: There are three overlapping beats: hopeful anticipation about Elder Heartwood’s capacity and answer; warm belonging/acceptance as Kira recognizes personal growth and team cohesion; and a muted dread about slow timelines that resolves into patient acceptance. The dominant tone is hopeful/anticipatory with an undercurrent of acceptance.

          Comparison with story pattern so far: This continues the story’s recurring anticipation→dread→acceptance arc, but shifts emphasis. Earlier beats featured sharper, often frantic dread and bureaucratic frustration; here the dread is softer (timing concerns) and is balanced by genuine belonging and confidence gained on the journey. The pattern repeats thematically but feels like emotional growth rather than redundancy—the bureaucratic frustration has been replaced by constructive hope and trust in an ancient wisdom.

        <beats>
          <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Cautious, energized optimism—Kira feels that Elder Heartwood is capable of reframing the survival question and providing a systemic, usable answer. Cause: Oakshade/Mossmantle’s concrete success stories, the ritual presentation, and the sense of having reached a true authority. Reader: experiences uplifted curiosity and invested anticipation—relief that there may be an actual solution and eagerness to learn what it will be.</beat>
          <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: Warm, settled belonging and quiet acceptance—Kira recognizes real personal growth (confidence, rhythm, trust in guides) and feels part of a team with Scout, Buddy, and the plant-guides. Cause: reflection on nine days of cumulative learning, shared routines, and affectionate small moments (Scout nudges, Buddy’s enthusiasm). Reader: feels reassurance and emotional satisfaction; this functions as a restorative, consoling beat after earlier trauma.</beat>
          <beat tags="dread, acceptance">POV: Low-level dread about timing ("months, seasons")—the prospect that Elder Heartwood’s deliberation could be too slow—tempered into patient acceptance when the guides insist that critical cases are prioritized. Cause: explicit talk of seasons/timeframes and Oakshade/Mossmantle’s assurances that critical issues accelerate response. Reader: retains mild anxiety about survival timelines but is calmed by the characters’ faith and Kira’s decision to wait with hope. Pattern note: This repeats the story’s anticipation→dread→acceptance motif but in a gentler, more grown form rather than an acute crisis.</beat>

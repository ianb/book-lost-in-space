      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>At the end of the passage the party has completed a ceremonial audience with Elder Heartwood and is physically leaving the valley. Key physical facts: Elder Heartwood is an enormous, single tree occupying the valley; its trunk, canopy, and root network form the landscape (raised root ridges, terraces, natural paths). The presenting ground at the base of the trunk is a cleared circular platform with natural root seating and a carpet of faintly bioluminescent moss; three other plant-beings (a massive fungal column, a flowing-vine entity, and a crystalline-plant entity) remain there. During the presentation the roots flexed and the tree emitted a deep groan indicating acknowledgement; Elder Heartwood is now actively "considering" the question and is expected to take weeks to months to decide. The party — Kira, Scout, Oakshade, Mossmantle (and Buddy as an internal/communicative presence) — are on the climb out of the valley toward the territory boundaries and the long walk home. Environmental conditions in the valley include a perpetual twilight under the canopy, thicker, wood-scented air at the base, faint bioluminescence on the presenting ground, and quiet ambient sounds (wind through massive branches, trickling water, small creatures). The ascent out is steeper and quieter; no injuries or immediate hazards are reported. These are the physical conditions and locations that will matter going forward: the immensity and agency of Elder Heartwood (it can alter roots/landscape and will take long to answer), the still-occupied presenting ground, and the party's current uphill movement away from the valley toward Territory Three boundaries.</reasoning>
        <state>Elder Heartwood dominates the valley: a single, ancient tree with a trunk hundreds of meters across, a canopy that casts perpetual twilight, and a network of raised roots that form terraces and paths. The presenting ground at the tree’s base is a cleared circular platform with natural root seating and soft, faintly bioluminescent moss; three plant-beings (fungal column, flowing-vine entity, crystalline plant) remain there. During the audience the roots flexed and the tree emitted a deep groan; Elder Heartwood is now considering the question and will take weeks-to-months to respond. Kira, Scout, Oakshade, and Mossmantle have left the presenting ground and are climbing out of the valley, moving toward territory boundaries and the long walk home; Scout is near Kira, and Buddy remains a quiet internal presence. The valley air near the trunk is thicker and wood-scented; ambient sounds include wind in branches and trickling water. The party is physically intact and fatigued but uninjured; no immediate hazards are present.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage centers on a face-to-face presentation to Elder Heartwood and immediate sensory/terrain consequences of climbing higher. The main payoffs: (1) Kira and the guides formally present a question to Elder Heartwood — the query that had been pending is now actually filed/presented; (2) the earlier warning about thinning air is realized in the climb. Most other investigative and logistical threads from the previous passage remain active and unresolved: ship/system mysteries, rescue timeline, plant motives, Buddy vs SAM capability, supplies/life-support, guide documentation/ritual implications, and so on. The passage introduces new, narrower foreshadowing threads tied to the Elder encounter: the hours-to-months response timeline and its logistical consequences, the ritual presentation as a formal flagging/recording of Kira (possible obligations or scrutiny), the bioluminescent presenting ground/moss (possible communicative/network function), and the palpable sign that Elder Heartwood is "thinking" (roots moving, low groan) which suggests capability to perceive/process and later act — all of which create future narrative promises. No previous promise is explicitly abandoned in this passage; most remain relevant.</reasoning>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I extracted only details from the passage that add durable information likely to matter later (procedures, signals, timing/queue information, and stable communication patterns). I omitted transient sensory details and items already captured in the provided summary (size of Elder Heartwood, presenting-ground description, presence of three plant-beings, the roots flexing/groan, and that Elder is considering the question). I flagged no contradictions because the passage develops existing worldbuilding (Elder's slow-time thinking, long waits, plant bureaucracy) rather than contradicting any previously established fact.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_OTHER_PETITIONERS_WAITED_SEVENTEEN_DAYS">Other plant-beings present at the presenting ground have been waiting seventeen days to consult Elder Heartwood (there is a visible queue/backlog of petitioners).</fact>
          <fact id="ELDER_ACKNOWLEDGMENT_SIGNAL_ROOTS_GROAN">Elder Heartwood signals acknowledgement of received questions by flexing roots and producing a very low, chest‑felt groan—an observable, physical communicative response pattern.</fact>
          <fact id="PLANT_PRESENTATION_RITUAL">Submitting a question to Elder Heartwood is a formalized ritual at the presenting ground: a designated presenter (Oakshade) announces the petition in ceremonial language while attending plant representatives observe.</fact>
          <fact id="POST_PRESENTATION_RETURN_HOME_DIRECTIVE">After a question is presented, attending plants instruct petitioners to return home and resume ordinary life while Elder Heartwood considers the query; petitioners are expected to wait for a later response rather than remain at the tree.</fact>
          <fact id="PLANT_REPRESENTATIVES_DISTINCT_COMMUNICATION_STYLES">Different plant representatives exhibit distinct communication/behavioral styles: fungal columns speak in layered/multiplexed voices, vine-types use close physical inspection, and crystalline-types report precise temporal/metric details (e.g., how long they've been waiting).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: it opens with “The second day is steeper” and “This morning’s climb,” so the scene begins the morning after the previous passage’s campsite. The party ascends, reaches Elder Heartwood, performs a short ceremonial presentation, is told to wait while the Elder considers (the plants say that will take weeks/months), and then they return toward territory boundaries the same day. The only explicit absolute time we have from the prior passage is the previous evening being around 18:30 (sunset). No calendar date is given. From those cues the passage spans a single daytime period (the second day), from morning departure through arrival at the presenting ground and the short ceremony, then the immediate return leg (climb back) — i.e., most of that daylight period. The long delays mentioned (17 days of waiting by others; Elder Heartwood’s thinking measured in weeks/months) are background/future intervals, not time that elapses within this passage.</reasoning>

        <gap-from-previous>~11–13 hours (overnight). Likely: previous passage ended around ~18:30 the evening before; they camped, slept, broke camp in the morning and set out—so roughly half a day passed between passages. During that gap they would have rested overnight, eaten, packed up, and begun the morning climb.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. An overnight rest followed by a morning ascent and a same-day presentation/return is consistent with the narrative cues. The tasks described (breaking camp, a strenuous morning climb to a valley/grove, a short ceremonial presentation and immediate departure) can reasonably fit within a single daylight period. Minor caveat: if the grove were extremely remote or required many additional hours of travel beyond a normal day’s hike, squeezing round-trip plus ceremony into one day could be tight—but the text implies the valley was reached within that day’s climb, and the ceremony itself is brief, so the timeline as presented is believable.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed only characters explicitly named in the passage that also have matching character card paths in the provided AVAILABLE CHARACTERS list. The passage mentions Oakshade and Mossmantle, and three unnamed plant-beings (fungal, vine, crystalline), but those names/paths were not provided in the AVAILABLE CHARACTERS list so I did not include them. Elder Heartwood, Kira Voss, Scout, and Buddy are named in the passage and have available paths, so they are included. Elder Heartwood appears when the group reaches the valley (i.e., enters during the scene). No character with a provided path is shown to exit (be present at the start and then leave before the passage ends), so EXITED is empty. The only provided entity relevant to the scene is the planet, which I included.</reasoning>

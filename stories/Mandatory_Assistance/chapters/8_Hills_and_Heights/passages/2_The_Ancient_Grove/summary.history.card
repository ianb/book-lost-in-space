      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          I compared the prior open-promises list to events in the current passage and marked items that were explicitly resolved, those that the passage left open (possibly reinforced), and any that were newly introduced. Key scene beats: Kira and guides climbed the steeper second-day route (thin air and harder ascent occurred), arrived at Elder Heartwood's enormous grove, formally presented the question in a ritual, and Elder Heartwood acknowledged/received the question and began to consider it, with an explicit expectation of a prolonged wait ("weeks, perhaps months").

          What I marked as fulfilled: items that the passage explicitly executed (the ascent/thinning-air warning; the formal presentation/submission to Elder Heartwood; arrival at the ancient grove; Oakshade &amp; Mossmantle functioning as guides in Territory Three; confirming the hill-country profile). These were explicit narrative payoffs of prior setups.

          What I left open / carried forward: unresolved mission-level problems (bio-samples, life support, navigation failure, stranded status, cargo/supplies, rescue estimates, etc.), procedural/factional threads (Elder Heartwood's eventual answer and its timing, pending guidance, many background systems like plant network, Remedy timelines, Buddy/Scout/Florence/Buddy catalog threads, long-term food safety), and emotional/skill arcs (Kira's confidence, Scout communication, Buddy's social-learning). Many of those threads were reinforced by the passage (for instance Elder guidance is now actively pending and the plants' certainty about Elder was emphasized). I preserved tentative flags exactly where prior promises were tentative and set appropriate tentative flags for new promises (firm when the narrative explicitly sets a future obligation/expectation, tentative when characters' confident claims could still be wrong).

          What I marked as lapsed: none. The passage didn't contradict or abandon any earlier open promise; it fulfilled several and left the rest unresolved. A number of older tentative items might naturally fade if never reinforced, but here several were either reinforced or remain plausibly relevant to the survival/quest stakes, so I carried them forward rather than lapse them.

        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I extracted only facts that introduce durable status changes or long-term reference points likely to matter later: Kira's in-person presentation to Elder Heartwood, Elder Heartwood's acknowledgement and the start of its deliberation, the grove's physical and ceremonial features, the presence of additional plant entities participating in the ritual, and the specificreported wait time (17 days) for those participants. I did not include transient sensory details (how Kira feels in the moment) or repeat already-established items (that Elder is slow, that Elder resides in the Ancient Grove, that Elder thinks in seasons, etc.). I checked for contradictions with prior facts: none of these items conflict with previously established facts (the 17-day wait here is the actual wait for these representatives and does not negate earlier estimates of multi-week-to-month response times).</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_PRESENTED_EXCEPTION_QUERY_IN_PERSON">Kira physically attended the presenting ground at Elder Heartwood's grove and Oakshade/Mossmantle formally presented her exception/question to Elder Heartwood in a ceremonial ritual.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_ACKNOWLEDGED_QUERY">Elder Heartwood responded to the presentation: the roots flexed and a deep groan resonated, indicating Elder Heartwood has received the question and begun deliberation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_SCALE_AND_TOPOGRAPHIC_INTEGRATION">Elder Heartwood is an immense single organism—trunk on the order of hundreds of meters across, a canopy that covers the valley (creating perpetual twilight beneath), and roots that form and shape the landscape (paths, terraces, seating).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PRESENTING_GROUND_FEATURES">The presenting ground is a cleared circular area at the base of Elder Heartwood with natural root-formed seating and soft bioluminescent moss covering the ground, used for formal presentations.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PARTICIPATING_PLANT_BEINGS_PRESENT">Three additional plant entities were present and took part in the ritual: a layered fungal/mushroom column (speaks in layered voices), a flowing-vine entity, and a crystalline plant-being (each acting as local representatives/intermediaries).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PARTICIPANTS_WAITED_SEVENTEEN_DAYS">The plant representatives at the presenting ground report they have been waiting seventeen days for Elder Heartwood's consideration in this instance.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PRESENTATION_RITUAL_AND_WAIT_PROCESS_CONFIRMED">There is a formal ritual/process: guides present a framed question publicly to Elder Heartwood on the presenting ground, Elder Heartwood then receives and begins its slow consideration, and the group then waits for an answer (timescale described as weeks to months/seasons).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage opens with an explicit temporal marker: "The second day is steeper" and "This morning's climb...", so it begins the morning after the previous passage's campsite scene. The instructions above designate the previous passage as ending at 2687-03-27T20:00 (authoritative). The characters had camped and slept at sunset in the previous passage, so the natural next moment is the following morning. The passage covers the morning climb, arrival at Elder Heartwood's valley, the presenting-grounds ritual (which takes only minutes to hours in-scene), and then the descent and initial portion of the return journey—i.e., most of a single daytime period. The narration implies they do not remain to wait for Elder Heartwood's deliberation (which is said to take weeks or months); instead the tree acknowledges receipt and the party departs the same day. That places the end of the passage late in that same day (evening/late afternoon) after they've begun heading back toward territory boundaries. Using reasonable travel and rest pacing for a guided group that slept overnight and then made a strenuous climb, a morning start ~07:00–08:00 with the group returning to the path/homeward direction by late afternoon/early evening is plausible. Note: there is a minor inconsistency in the provided materials (a secondary previous-ending-time of ~2687-03-27T17:45), but the prompt asked to use the authoritative previous outline time of 2687-03-27T20:00; I used that as the reference.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-03-28T07:30 (approx)</starts>
        <ends>2687-03-28T18:30 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>11 hours 30 minutes (approx). From 2687-03-27T20:00 to ~2687-03-28T07:30. What likely happened in that gap: the party rested at the campsite, slept overnight, broke camp in the morning, and began the steeper climb that forms the opening of this passage.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (overnight rest followed by a full day of strenuous climbing, a short ritual/presentation, and beginning the return journey the same day) matches the events described. The actions performed—morning ascent, arriving at a valley and presenting a question at a ceremonial ground, a brief acknowledgement from an ancient tree, then descending and starting the trip home—are reasonable to fit within a single daytime period following an overnight rest. The narrative explicitly states Elder Heartwood's substantive deliberation will take weeks or months, so leaving the same day after presenting the question is consistent and avoids any implausible expectation of an immediate, lengthy consultation. No major timing contradictions are evident given the context and the authoritative previous end time.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I scanned the passage for any of the available character names and entity names. Explicitly named and clearly present from the provided character list: Kira Voss (narrator), Scout (companion), Buddy (speaks mentally), and Elder Heartwood (the vast tree). Oakshade and Mossmantle are repeatedly present and active in the scene, and the passage describes three other plant beings (fungal, vine, crystalline), but none of those names appear in the provided available-characters list, so I did not add them to the output. No other available characters are named or clearly present. No available characters clearly enter during the scene who weren’t already with the group at the start, and no available characters that were present early leave before the passage ends (the group departs together at the end), so the ENTERED and EXITED lists are empty. The relevant entity is the planet/setting (Sector 7-Gamma-412), which matches the available entities list; the other available entity is not mentioned.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage advances the main plot by delivering Kira to Elder Heartwood, formalizing the central question about how plants should care for a human, and getting an explicit acknowledgement that Elder Heartwood has received the question and will deliberate on a long timescale. I should add that event and its consequences (advice to return home, expected deliberation time of weeks/months) and note the presence of other territorial delegates and that they'd already been waiting. I can consolidate travel- and campsite-related bullets into a single compact travel/learning entry since those details are less critical now. I should keep unresolved, ongoing problems (active Biological Samples, SAM offline, broken external comms/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood's pending guidance) because they drive future action.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (Scout, territory guides, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle was used as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for formal guidance and received inter-territorial travel approval; Buddy and Scout accompanied her.
          - Kira traveled through three territories escorted by successive guide pairs (Leafwhisper/Rootwalker; Streamwalker/Brightbloom; Oakshade/Mossmantle), learned plant social structures and signaling, and improved her endurance over nine days of travel.
          - Oakshade and Mossmantle led Kira to the presenting ground at the base of Elder Heartwood after a steep final climb.
          - At the presenting ground Kira met three territorial delegates (fungal, vine, crystalline); Oakshade presented a formal question asking how to properly care for a human and bridge incompatible frameworks between species.
          - Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt—the roots shifted and a deep groan resonated—and the delegates report they had already been waiting seventeen days.
          - Delegates advised Kira to return home while Elder Heartwood deliberates; the tree will consider on a seasonal timescale (weeks–months) and its guidance is awaited and treated as authoritative.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues: active Biological Samples container, SAM still offline, external communications/distress beacon broken, and Elder Heartwood’s full guidance remains pending.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV feelings: Kira moves between awe, hopeful anticipation, and pragmatic acceptance. Seeing Elder Heartwood triggers near-reverent wonder (the tree’s scale, the presenting-ground ritual), which instantly reframes her fatigue as meaningful purpose—she feels small but connected. When Oakshade formally presents the question and the roots register acknowledgment, Kira experiences a spike of hope and trust that this ancient intelligence can bridge human-plant needs. That hope is immediately tempered by the practical reality that Elder Heartwood thinks on seasonal timescales; she registers unease at the prospect of waiting weeks or months, but chooses to accept and trust the process. Reader experience: the passage gives a steady emotional arc from physical strain to a transcendent vista, then to quiet, bittersweet anticipation. The reader is invited to share in Kira’s awe and cautious optimism while feeling the frustration of slow time. Multiple beats vs single tone: there are clearly multiple emotional beats—(1) physical exhaustion resolving into exhilarated wonder at the grove, (2) ceremonial presentation and the uplift of having the question received, and (3) the sobering realization of long wait-times that converts excitement into patient, somewhat anxious acceptance. Comparison to pattern so far: this continues and consolidates existing themes—trust-building with plant intelligences, Kira’s transition from survival focus to quest-oriented agency, and recurring wonder at alien ecology—while introducing a larger, more cosmic scale (Elder Heartwood) and a deeper temporal mismatch (seasonal vs human urgency). Surprises: there is a modest world-level surprise in how literally and architecturally enormous Elder Heartwood is and how the valley functions as a single organism/space; otherwise the scene follows established expectations (Elder Heartwood exists, is slow, and receives questions). Character growth/revelation: Kira deepens her trust in the collective’s wisdom and makes a concrete choice to return and wait—to resume life under the expectation that the ancient tree will produce a usable answer. This is less a sudden transformation than a consolidation of prior development (trust, decision, identity as a traveler/participant). Overall tone: solemn, reverent hope edged with practical unease; the passage rewards the reader with a quietly powerful emotional center rather than high drama.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="wonder, intimacy">Awe and reverence when Kira first sees Elder Heartwood: physical exhaustion evaporates into stunned wonder as she recognizes the tree’s unimaginable scale and the valley-as-organism. The emotion is driven by sensory detail (trunk width, canopy twilight, living roots-as-architecture). The reader experiences a cinematic, almost spiritual uplift—a sense of smallness and being in the presence of something ancient.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, relief">Anticipatory hope when Oakshade presents the question and the roots register acknowledgment: the ritual reception and the deep groan communicate that Kira’s core problem has been heard by a being of authority. Kira feels buoyed and reassured; the reader shares a warm release and a renewed investment in the quest for practical solutions.</beat>
          <beat tags="acceptance, unease">Pragmatic acceptance mixed with unease after learning Elder Heartwood thinks in seasons: Kira confronts the prospect of waiting weeks or months. She chooses to trust the process and return home, clinging to the hope that the answer will be worth the delay. The reader feels bittersweet tension—comforted by the promise of wisdom but frustrated by the slow timeline.</beat>

        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="world">Scale and literalness of Elder Heartwood: while the existence and slowness of Elder Heartwood were foreshadowed, the passage reveals—with sensory force—that the tree is a valley-covering organism whose roots form landscape-scale architecture and a formal presenting ground. The physical, architectural enormity of a single organism is a notable world-building surprise in degree (not kind).</surprise>

        <character-development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="trust-built">Consolidates trust in the plant collective and in the value of their processes—she emotionally accepts Elder Heartwood's slow-timescale reasoning and decides to return home and wait for the answer rather than push for immediate fixes. This is a choice to defer urgency in favor of long-view wisdom.</development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="decision">Makes a concrete decision to resume life and abide by the plants' timeframe: she accepts the ritual outcome and the slow timeline, turning hope into a patient commitment to the process.</development>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage establishes several durable, story-relevant facts about Elder Heartwood, the grove, and the immediate outcome of the formal presentation that will matter in later scenes (timeline expectations, ritual process, who was present, physical scale and environment of the grove). I exclude transient sensory details and obvious emotional reactions unless they change Kira's longer-term position (e.g., renewed hope that influences decisions). Nothing in this passage contradicts previously recorded facts (Elder Heartwood's slow temporal frame and long response times were already established as weeks-to-months; the new details are consistent and fill in physical/ceremonial specifics).</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_GROVE_PHYSICAL_SCALE">Elder Heartwood is a single, enormous tree-like organism—trunk hundreds of meters across with branches and a canopy that cover an entire valley; its roots form raised ridges and terraces that function as landscape/architecture.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PRESENTING_GROUND_FEATURES">The presenting ground at Elder Heartwood's base is a cleared, circular platform with natural root-formed seating and soft, faintly bioluminescent moss underfoot used for ceremonial presentation.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_THREE_PLANT_BEINGS_PRESENT_AT_GROVE">At least three distinct plant entities were present to receive the presentation: a massive fungal-column/bloom (shelf-like spiral), a flowing-vine plant, and a crystalline/plant hybrid being.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FUNGAL_ENTITY_LAYERED_VOICE">The fungal-column entity speaks in a layered, multi-organism harmony and acts in a ceremonial/reverent role during the presentation (serving as a speaker/mediator).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_CRYSTALLINE_ENTITY_REPORTS_SEVENTEEN_DAY_WAIT">The crystalline plant-being reports that it (and/or those gathered) has been waiting seventeen days, indicating some groups/individuals keep multi-day waits prior to or during Elder Heartwood consultations.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_AND_RESPONSE_METHOD">Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt of the formal question by subtle root movement and a deep resonant groan; the grove's response method includes slow physical/energetic acknowledgment and then a deliberative period of consideration.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_THINKS_IN_SEASONS_MONTHS">Elder Heartwood operates on long timescales—its thinking/response frame is in seasons/months (weeks-to-months expected), and consultations require waiting rather than immediate answers.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FORMAL_RITUAL_PRESENTATION_PRACTICE">Oakshade and the guides performed a formal ceremonial presentation of Kira's question at the presenting ground; the collective treats such presentations as ritualized and expects participants to return and await a considered answer.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_INSTRUCTION_TO_RETURN_AND_AWAIT_ANSWER">Elder Heartwood's representatives instructed Kira and her guides to return home and resume life while Elder Heartwood considers the question—i.e., the immediate directive is to leave and wait rather than receive an immediate intervention.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_BEHAVIOR_SUBDUED_IN_GROVE">Scout exhibited subdued, reverent behavior in the grove (bounced less, rolled quietly), indicating Elder Heartwood's presence affects even the otherwise-energetic sphere companions.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_HOPEFUL_AFTER_PRESENTATION">Kira experiences a renewed, sustained hope/belief in Elder Heartwood's capacity to provide useful, long-term guidance about human care—an emotional state likely to influence her future decisions and patience with waiting.</fact>
    </established>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Cues in the text establish a clear overnight transition and a same-day completing of the climb/visit. The previous passage ends at an evening campsite at sunset (~18:00). The current passage opens with “The second day is steeper” and “This morning's climb…,” indicating the narrative resumes the next morning after the campsite rest. The party makes a rigorous morning climb, reaches Elder Heartwood mid-day (they descend into the valley, have the formal presentation, wait for instructions that will take weeks/months), then immediately depart and begin the climb back toward territory boundaries. That sequence — camp at sunset, sleep overnight, set out next morning, hike through the morning, reach the presenting ground by mid/late morning to early afternoon, then return the same day toward the boundary — implies the passage covers a span of hours on the next day (morning → afternoon). The passage also contains an explicit external time scale unrelated to the immediate timeline: other plants have been “waiting seventeen days,” and Elder Heartwood’s reply will require “weeks, months” — but those are waiting times for the elder’s deliberation, not elapsed time within the passage. One small possible inconsistency: the provided previous-passage summary labels the prior scene “~18:00 (third day — sunset),” while the previous passage text itself contains the line “First day complete.” The “second day” in this passage reads like the second day of the local hiking sequence (i.e., the morning after the campsite). Overall the temporal flow (evening camp → next-morning tougher climb → valley visit → return toward boundaries the same day) is plausible and internally consistent.</reasoning>
    <starts>07:30 (next morning, approximate)</starts>
    <ends>16:00 (same day, approximate afternoon/evening travel begins)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈13 hours (previous passage ends at campsite around ~18:00; the passage resumes the next morning after an overnight rest). Activities in that gap: sleeping, breaking camp, packing, and setting out at first light.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. It is reasonable that the group rests at a campsite at sunset, starts the next morning, completes a steep morning climb to reach Elder Heartwood, holds a (brief) ceremonial presentation, and then departs back toward territory boundaries the same day. The only minor note is the indexing language: the previous passage’s summary calling it the “third day” while the text calls this the “second day” likely reflects different ways of counting days (local ‘day of this leg’ vs. an overall trip day count) but does not break the internal timeline. The long deliberation (weeks/months) by Elder Heartwood is explicitly future time and does not conflict with the short duration of this passage.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters explicitly named in the passage that match the provided character list: Kira Voss (/world/characters/Kira_Voss.card), Scout (/world/characters/Scout.card), Buddy (/world/characters/Buddy.card), and Elder Heartwood (/world/characters/Elder_Heartwood.card). The passage also continues the group that was present at the end of the previous passage (Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Streamwalker, Brightbloom), so those characters are treated as present here as well. Several named figures in the passage (Oakshade, Mossmantle) and three unnamed plant-beings (fungal, vine, crystalline) do not have matching entries in the provided character list, so they cannot be mapped to card paths and are not listed. No new, mappable characters enter during this scene, and no mappable characters explicitly leave before the passage ends. The grove/valley and Elder Heartwood are part of the planet context — the only provided matching entity is the planet card, so it is included.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage describes Kira reaching the Elder Heartwood, a formal presentation ritual, and Elder Heartwood's acknowledgment that it will deliberate before answering — key plot developments that change the immediate plan (they must return and wait). I consolidated earlier travel details (daily campsite minutiae, repeated territory handoff specifics) into a single compact bullet summarizing the guided nine-day journey and Kira's adaptation, since those details are now background. I retained the shuttle crash, SAM offline, Buddy/Scout, medical treatment, the decision to travel, the swamp rescue, and Scout's investigations because they remain plot-relevant. I added bullets for arrival at the presenting ground, the ritual question to Elder Heartwood, the 17-day waiting detail from other plants, Elder Heartwood's timescale (weeks/months/seasons) for deliberation, and the instruction that Kira must return home and wait — all of which set the next phase of the story.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI "Buddy" is active but battery-limited.
      - Shuttle hull breached but planet atmosphere is breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon are damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood instead of waiting for rescue.
      - Kira undertook a guided, multi-territory journey over nine days with handoffs between guides (Territories One–Three); Scout and Buddy accompanied her and she learned plant-networked survival practices and improved stamina and balance.
      - During the trek Kira was rescued from a hidden swamp hole by Streamwalker and Scout investigated crystalline mineral formations (contextual discoveries that informed plant explanations).
      - Kira and guides reached the Elder Heartwood valley: a single, valley-spanning ancient tree whose roots form the landscape; a cleared, bioluminescent "presenting ground" sits at its base.
      - Oakshade formally presented Kira's question to Elder Heartwood—how to care for a human and bridge incompatible frameworks between humans and plants.
      - Three other plant beings (fungal, vine, crystalline) were present and reported they had been waiting seventeen days; Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt (roots shifting and a low groan).
      - Elder Heartwood will deliberate on a seasonal timescale (weeks to months); the plant consensus is that its eventual guidance will be able to bridge the frameworks.
      - Kira was instructed to return home and wait for Elder Heartwood's answer; she left the grove hopeful and began the climb back toward territory boundaries.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: The passage moves Kira from physical exhaustion into a sharp, almost instantaneous uplift when she sees Elder Heartwood; her fatigue is replaced by anticipation and then profound awe and reverence. That awe softens into a complex mix of hopeful trust and sober resignation when she learns the tree will deliberate in its own slow terms (weeks-to-months). The immediate emotional arc is: strain → sudden anticipatory energizing → awe/reverence → steadying hope tempered by the dread of a long wait. Reader: Likely experiences a matching shift — relief and excitement that Kira has reached the goal, sensory wonder and goosebump-level awe at the scale and age of Elder Heartwood, then a bittersweet tightening as the timeline (“months”) sinks in. There are multiple beats (anticipation/hope, wonder/belonging/reverence, then hope complicated by dread) rather than one dominant emotion. Compared to the story so far, this continues the recurring anticipation→tension/dread→acceptance pattern but refreshes it: the immediate threat arc is replaced by a contemplative, reverent pause. The bureaucratic frustration motif is absent here; instead the scene deepens the wonder and long-term stakes (waiting in seasons), shifting the emotional pattern toward patient hope infused with existential scale rather than procedural irritation.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Physical fatigue and soreness give way to a surge of anticipation and renewed hope when Oakshade and Mossmantle announce Elder Heartwood is near. The prospect of finally getting a real answer dispels exhaustion and quickens Kira's energy. Reader: Feels lifted and engaged — relief that the journey has a payoff and curiosity about what comes next.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, belonging">POV: Overwhelming awe and reverence at the first sight of Elder Heartwood — scale, age, and the living architecture induce a spine-tingling wonder and a humble, almost homeward feeling in the grove (even Scout is subdued). The ritual setting and the presenting ground produce a sense that Kira is part of something larger. Reader: Experiences sensory astonishment and emotional uplift; the scene invites reverence and a warm, almost intimate feeling of inclusion in the moment.</beat>
      <beat tags="dread, hope">POV: A mixed, quieter beat after the presentation: hope and trust in Elder Heartwood's authority counterbalanced by the sinking dread of an uncertain, possibly months-long wait for an answer. Kira wants to believe absolutely and chooses to hold hope, but she must accept slow, seasonal timelines. Reader: Feels bittersweet — reassured that an authoritative solution may exist, yet anxious at the long delay and the practical implications for survival. Pattern note: this continues the story's recurring anticipation→acceptance dynamic but shifts the dread from acute danger to slow time.</beat>
    </beats>
  </emotional-journey>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      This passage is a clear escalation beat: Kira reaches Elder Heartwood, formally presents the question, and Elder Heartwood acknowledges and begins a deliberation that will take weeks or months. That creates new forward-facing narrative promises (an ancient authority will deliberate and eventually provide guidance that could bridge human–plant care frameworks; the answer will arrive later; the delay will be measured in weeks-to-months).

      Fulfillments: The passage resolves some short-term travel/setup promises from the open list: Kira actually reaches the intended destination (Elder Heartwood) and experiences the thin-air, steeper climb Oakshade warned about.

      Lapses: The most concrete thing that changes the story’s logistics is the revelation that Elder Heartwood deliberates on seasonal timescales ("weeks, months"). That undermines the earlier 2–3 week travel-duration estimate as an actionable expectation for resolving Kira's problem, so that earlier timeline estimate becomes moot. Most other open promises remain live: many are broader mysteries (shuttle anomalies, SAM, navigation failure) or ongoing constraints (nutrition, medical limits, guide dynamics) and are neither contradicted nor resolved here.

      New promises introduced are chiefly about Elder Heartwood’s authority and the expectation that a meaningful answer will eventually be delivered; none of those are resolved in this passage. Several ongoing threads are reinforced (maintained/ritualized territory, plant network authority, Scout/Buddy morale roles), so those stay open.

      Decisions made:
      - Fulfilled: AIR_THINNING_AHEAD (experienced) and TRAVEL_TO_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_AVAILABLE (arrived/presented). These were explicit, concrete promises in the open list and the passage pays them off.
      - Lapsed: TRAVEL_DURATION_ESTIMATE_2_TO_3_WEEKS (superseded by Elder’s months-long deliberation; original short trip estimate is no longer reliable for resolving Kira’s core problem).
      - Carried forward: most other open promises continue to be relevant because the passage either directly reinforces them or leaves them unresolved (e.g., SAM fate, shuttle anomalies, medical/vitamin risks, guide handoff opaqueness, maintained-territory cues, Remedy monitoring, Scout/Buddy morale).
    </reasoning>

      <promise id="GUIDE_HANDOFF_INFORMATION_TRANSFER" tentative="true" introduced="22">Opaque guide-to-guide information exchange at boundaries remains unresolved; the formal presentation suggests protocol and potential hidden data transfer that could be significant later.</promise>
      <promise id="MOSSMANTLE_MOBILITY_MECHANISM_UNSPECIFIED" tentative="true" introduced="22">Mossmantle's method of mobility (flowing across ground) remains unexplained and available for future reveal.</promise>
      <promise id="MINERAL_DEPOSITS_PRESENT" tentative="true" introduced="23">Mineral/crystalline formations are present in the terrain and crystalline beings are part of the ecology—these resource/landmark/hazard threads remain available.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_WILL_PROVIDE_BRIDGING_GUIDANCE" tentative="false" introduced="24">New (firm) promise: The plants assert Elder Heartwood can bridge 'incompatible frameworks' and provide guidance on how to care for a human; this sets an expectation that Elder's eventual answer will be meaningful and actionable.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_RESPONSE_DELAY" tentative="false" introduced="24">New (firm) promise: Elder Heartwood's deliberation will take an extended time (weeks to months), so resolution is delayed and will not be immediate.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_WILL_COMMUNICATE_LATER" tentative="true" introduced="24">New (tentative) promise: When Elder Heartwood's understanding is ready, the answer will be delivered to Kira ("the answer will come"); the method/timing of that communication is currently unspecified but is promised.</promise>
      <promise id="YOU_RETURN_AND_WAIT" tentative="true" introduced="24">New (tentative) logistical promise: Kira is instructed to return to her life and resume normal travel / daily routines while Elder considers; narrative expectation is that she will wait and then receive guidance later.</promise>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I reviewed the prior open-promises list against the events and details of the current passage. I treated a promise as "fulfilled" only if the passage explicitly showed the promised event/capability completed or clearly enacted (and the promise appeared in the previous open list). I treated a promise as "lapsed" when the story clearly moved beyond the context that made that promise relevant (wetland-specific promises now behind them) or when a tentative, older hint had no reinforcement and the current scene made it moot. All other prior promises remain open because they were neither resolved nor contradicted. I also identified new, actionable narrative promises introduced by concrete facts in the passage (firm if the passage explicitly commits to a future challenge or a clearly demonstrated capability; tentative if it's an implication or softer thematic setup). Where possible I included a brief description explaining the choice.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="SCOUT_WITH_NEW_GUIDES">Scout immediately begins interacting and adapting to Oakshade and Mossmantle—bouncing, investigating crystalline rocks, and integrating with the new guide style, showing the earlier promise of Scout working with the new Territory Three guides is realized.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="WETLAND_RIVER_STONES_MAINTAINED_BY_NETWORK">This was a wetland-specific resource/test hinted earlier. The party has left the wetlands and the scene moves into hill/stone country, making this wetlands-specific setup no longer immediately relevant to the current segment of the journey.</promise>
      <promise id="WETLAND_RIVER_HELPFULNESS">A tentative atmospheric idea that some water features assist travelers was tied to the wetlands. The characters have transitioned to hills; that wetland-specific framing is not reinforced here and becomes moot for the immediate arc.</promise>
      <promise id="RESEARCH_WETLAND_DECOMPOSITION">Buddy/Remedy's interest in studying wetland decomposition was a wetlands-focused research subplot. With the travelers departed from wetlands and no documentation activity shown here, the immediate opportunity for that research has lapsed (it can be reopened if they return to wetlands).</promise>

      <promise id="MOSSMANTLE_CAN_PRODUCE_FUEL" tentative="false" introduced="23">Mossmantle demonstrates producing flammable spores/fuel to prepare a fire pit—introduces a concrete capability (fuel/spore production) that may matter later.</promise>
      <promise id="TERRITORY_THREE_MAINTAINED_CAMPSITE_AVAILABLE" tentative="true" introduced="23">The passage shows a cleared, maintained campsite with spring, fire pit, and moss sleeping patches—establishes that territory maintenance provides traveler infrastructure (useful on future stops).</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_SOCIAL_LEARNING_PROGRESS" tentative="true" introduced="23">Buddy's behavior shifts toward supportive encouragement rather than only factual reporting—this social-learning thread is introduced as ongoing development for Buddy's character/interaction style.</promise>
    </open>
  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>I selected only durable facts from the passage that matter for future continuity: new details about the hill-terrain (how it behaves and its physical demands), Kira's accumulated walking experience and improved competence, Scout's aptitude for hilly terrain, the specific features of the hill-area campsite, and a small development in Buddy's behavior (more emotionally supportive). I did not record transient details (today's sunset, exact dialogue lines, momentary feelings) or facts already present in the previous summary/list (e.g., which characters are present). I flagged no contradictions because the passage develops existing material (Territory Three as hilly, presence of guides, Buddy accompanying Kira) rather than contradicting any prior established facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_THREE_HILL_TERRAIN_CHARACTER">The hill territory features deceptive slopes with changing angles and loose, skittering stone underfoot; elevation here increases exertion and engages different muscle groups than wetlands or forest walking.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_NINE_DAYS_WALKING_EXPERIENCE_AND_COMPETENCE">Kira has been walking for nine days on the route and has materially improved stamina, competence, and confidence in long-distance, varied-terrain travel (able to read terrain cues and maintain pace without struggle).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_ADAPTED_TO_ELEVATION">Scout is well-adapted to hilly/elevated terrain, enjoying uphill bouncing and downhill rolling; its momentum and behavior differ in this terrain but it remains an effective companion.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HILL_CAMPSITE_FEATURES">The evening campsite in the hill territory is a sheltered spot between rock formations with a small spring trickling down the rocks, a maintained fire pit provided/managed by plants, and encouraged moss patches cultivated as sleeping areas.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_INCREASING_SUPPORTIVE_TONE">Buddy is showing development in interpersonal style—beyond technical scans it is giving brief, encouraging, emotionally supportive remarks to Kira (e.g., verbal praise for her performance).</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage clearly continues immediately after the previous one: they cross the boundary into Territory Three and begin climbing the first hill. The previous passage end time given in the outline is 2687-03-27T14:00, which I take as the start moment for this passage. Temporal cues within the passage: an initial climb to a plateau, the guide Mossmantle saying "Another three hours to tonight's rest area," an afternoon of continued hill-walking, and arrival at the evening campsite as the sun is setting. That line ("Another three hours to tonight's rest area") anchors the remaining travel time from the plateau to the campsite. Allowing a short period for the initial climb up to the plateau (roughly 30–60 minutes) plus the three hours Mossmantle gives, the group reaches camp in the late afternoon/early evening. Therefore the passage plausibly spans roughly 3.5–4 hours, from early afternoon to sunset.</reasoning>
    <starts>2687-03-27T14:00</starts>
    <ends>2687-03-27T17:45 (approx)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation from 2687-03-27T14:00</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The internal time cue of "Another three hours to tonight's rest area" plus a short initial climb supports an end time in the late afternoon/early evening. Covering several hours of hill walking, arriving at a prepared campsite with a water source and fire pit by sunset is reasonable for a party moving at a steady guided pace. No obvious timing contradictions within the passage. (Note: the previous-passage summary offered a different approximate end time, but per instructions the outline time 2687-03-27T14:00 was used as authoritative.)</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I identified characters explicitly named in the passage and cross-checked them against the provided available-character list. The narrator (Kira) and Scout are explicitly present throughout. Buddy speaks partway through the scene but was not listed as present at the end of the previous passage, so Buddy is an entering character. Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Streamwalker, and Brightbloom are all explicitly referenced in comparisons to other guide pairs and are in the available list, so they count as present. The passage also frequently mentions two plant-guides called Oakshade and Mossmantle, but those names are not in the provided available-character list, so I could not map them to a path and therefore did not include them in the path lists (noting this mismatch). No character explicitly leaves the scene before the passage ends. The setting is an alien planet; the available entity that matches is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.card.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage continues the Territory Three hill-country traversal and contains several plot-relevant developments: Kira encountered deceptive, taxing slopes but adapted physically and mentally, improving her confidence; Oakshade and Mossmantle’s complementary guiding styles (big-picture vs. immediate terrain) were reinforced; Buddy shifted from monitoring/stats to supportive encouragement; Scout remains an active companion; plants prepared a campsite with a spring, cleared ground, and a fire pit; the group plans a steeper climb the next day. I consolidated earlier guide-travel details into concise bullets and retained unresolved, still-important issues (active Biological Samples container, SAM offline, broken external comms/distress beacon, Elder Heartwood pending). I removed atmospheric minutiae and repetitive descriptions to keep the summary focused on events and actionable status.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
      - Shipboard AI SAM is offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
      - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (including Scout, Territory guides, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle served as temporary shelter.
      - The Biological Samples container remains active, glowing, drawing power, and cannot be shut down.
      - Kira integrated with the plant collective; Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
      - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for formal permissions; Elder Heartwood’s response is still pending.
      - Kira received inter-territorial travel approval and began guided travel; Buddy and Scout accompany her throughout.
      - Territory One: escorted by Leafwhisper and Rootwalker; Kira learned about fungal/root networks and plant social structures. Territory Two: escorted by Streamwalker and Brightbloom; Kira learned wetland signaling, crossed a chest-deep river and was rescued from a swamp sink; Buddy monitored vitals.
      - Territory handoffs proceeded (Streamwalker/Brightbloom → Oakshade/Mossmantle); Kira entered Territory Three and began a planned three-day hill-country traversal with Oakshade (tree-perspective, big-picture guidance) and Mossmantle (ground-level, immediate terrain guidance); Scout continues to accompany her.
      - During the first day of hill-country travel Kira encountered deceptive, shifting slopes and elevation strain but adapted quickly—her endurance and walking technique improved over nine days, and her confidence increased.
      - Oakshade and Mossmantle’s complementary styles were reinforced (Oakshade: long-term, philosophical guidance; Mossmantle: step-by-step terrain instruction); Buddy continued to monitor vitals and offered supportive encouragement rather than only analytics; Scout remained exploratory and morale-boosting.
      - Plants maintained a prepared evening campsite: cleared sheltered spot between rocks, a small spring/water source, encouraged moss sleeping patches, and a fire pit; the group plans a steeper, higher climb the next day.
      - Outstanding unresolved issues still matter going forward: active Biological Samples container, SAM remaining offline, broken external communications/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood’s pending response.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV feelings and why: Kira feels steady competence mixed with physical fatigue and a quiet pride. The climb forces bodily attention (aches, breath) but also reveals clear evidence of learning—her reflexes, pacing, and judgment have improved—so she experiences satisfaction, relief, and reinforced determination. Reader experience: the reader moves from mild tension (the hill is deceptively hard) into warmth and satisfaction as Kira's competence and belonging are affirmed. There are multiple emotional beats: initial physical struggle/strain, the interior recognition of growth, and the cozy campsite intimacy that closes the scene. Compared to the story so far: this passage continues the arc from isolated survivor to confident traveler; its emotional pattern is low-stakes and consoling rather than urgent—it consolidates previous gains rather than introducing new crises. Surprises: there are no major surprises here; the scene mostly confirms and deepens established dynamics (Kira's growing skill, the guides' complementary styles, Scout's playful delight). Character growth: Kira shows tangible skill acquisition and an internalized identity-shift—she not only can walk these terrains, she accepts this as her life now. Buddy shows a quieter social learning (more straightforward encouragement rather than analysis). Oakshade and Mossmantle's contrast is clarified (tree-scale philosophy vs. ground-level practicality), which helps Kira integrate multiple guide styles but doesn't overturn their prior characterization.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="determination, vulnerability">Kira struggles physically with the deceptive hill—legs burning, loose rocks, changing angles—so she feels determined to keep pace while also conscious of bodily limits. The reader experiences low-level tension and empathy rooted in physical realism rather than existential danger.</beat>
      <beat tags="joy, acceptance">Mid-climb Kira realizes she's adapted: her body and instincts now handle the terrain, and she smiles at her competence. This is a beat of quiet joy and acceptance—pride in earned skill. The reader feels satisfaction and uplift as an arc of growth pays off.</beat>
      <beat tags="intimacy, relief">At the evening campsite the group settles into comfortable routine—moss beds, shared fire, Scout curled beside her—and Kira experiences intimate, restful contentment and relief. The reader shares a warm, cozy sense of belonging and forward momentum.</beat>
    </beats>
    <character-development>
      <development character="Kira Voss" tag="identity-shift">Solidifies a transition from tentative survivor to competent traveler: she demonstrates embodied skill (reading terrain, pacing, trusting guides) and internalizes an identity-shift—this life is becoming hers ('This is my life now').</development>
      <development character="Buddy" tag="trust-built">Shows incremental social learning: instead of supplying facts or instruction, Buddy offers plain, human encouragement—a small but meaningful shift toward emotional support.</development>
      <development character="Oakshade" tag="revelation">Clarifies their role and worldview: Oakshade's big-picture, time-deep perspective (rings, slow processes) is emphasized and plays a constructive role in Kira's learning, revealing the productive contrast with Mossmantle's ground-level practicality.</development>

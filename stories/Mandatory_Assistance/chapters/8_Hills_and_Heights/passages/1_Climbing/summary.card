  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>The party has descended from the boundary climb and completed a day of travel in Territory Three. They reached an established evening campsite tucked between two rock formations. The passage describes physical, objective details: loose, skittering stones on the slopes; a plateau with expanded views back to the wetlands; a small spring trickling down the rocks at the campsite; cleared ground and a prepared fire pit; intentionally grown/arranged moss patches for sleeping. Oakshade is stationary and settled near the spring; Mossmantle is actively preparing fuel/starting the fire; Scout investigated a nearby crystalline rock cluster and is now curled up and sleeping on a moss patch; Kira has dropped her pack, eaten mushroom paste, and is physically tired but uninjured. Buddy (a companion device/AI) is present and functioning. Time is evening — sun set and stars coming out — and the party expects steeper climbs and thinner air tomorrow. No other characters or new hazards are introduced.</reasoning>
    <state>Kira and Scout are camped at an evening rest site in Territory Three, sheltered between two rock formations with a small spring trickling down the rocks. The ground at the site has been cleared and a fire pit is present; moss sleeping patches have been cultivated and claimed. Oakshade is settled near the spring; Mossmantle is preparing fuel/lighting the fire; Scout is asleep on a moss patch; Kira has dropped her pack and eaten dinner and is fatigued but uninjured. Nearby slopes remain loose and rocky (one crystalline rock cluster Scout inspected), the wetlands and forests are visible back the way they came, and it is sunset/early night with steeper, higher-elevation terrain (thinner air) expected tomorrow.</state>
  </physical-reality>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage largely confirms and develops the on-the-ground reality of Territory Three (hills, loose stone, maintained campsites, a spring) and the personalities/dynamics of the new guides, while introducing short-term hazards (altitude, slipping, flammable spore-fuel) to watch next. I treat as "fulfilled" those prior open promises that the passage directly and concretely paid off (terrain type confirmed, campsite maintenance and an actual water source at the evening site). Most other prior promises remain relevant and unresolved (technical mystery, mission questions, AI status and limits, long-term logistics, plant motives, governance, Buddy limits, Scout endurance, documentation/records, etc.). No prior open promise is clearly abandoned or rendered moot by this passage — the narrative threads remain live even if not advanced here. New promises introduced are locally foreshadowing hazards and resources that will affect near-term travel and raise investigative questions about plant capabilities (fire use, mineral deposits).</reasoning>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>Identify only facts that matter for long-term continuity: character traits/roles that shape future behavior, capabilities that affect logistics or survival, and state changes in relationships/skills. I did not record transient scene details (time of day, immediate actions) or items already captured in the provided summary. I flagged two changes (Kira's increased competence from cumulative walking; Buddy's small behavioral shift toward concise encouragement) because they alter how those characters will behave in future scenes. I also recorded stable traits about the guides (Oakshade's tendency to settle and Mossmantle's ability to produce flammable spores) and the functional dynamic between them because those affect future campsite behavior, guidance style, and resource production. No statements in this passage contradict the previously established facts, so no conflicts are reported.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_COMPETENT_LONG_DISTANCE_WALKING">After roughly nine days of guided travel, Kira has developed a durable walking rhythm and practical competence at multi-terrain, long-distance hiking—she no longer struggles and moves with confidence and steady pacing.</fact>
      <fact id="MOSSMANTLE_PRODUCES_FLAMMABLE_SPORES">Mossmantle (and/or ground plants in this territory) can produce flammable spores or similar biological material used to create fuel and start fires for campsite lighting and fuel needs.</fact>
      <fact id="OAKSHADE_SETTLES_AND_REMAINS_ROOTED">Oakshade habitually finds a suitable spot near water or shelter and remains largely immobile once settled (tree behavior: 'roots down, stay put'), serving as a stationary presence at campsites.</fact>
      <fact id="GUIDE_PAIR_DYNAMIC_OAKSHADE_VS_MOSSMANTLE">Oakshade and Mossmantle operate as a complementary guide pair: Oakshade provides long-timescale, conceptual/big-picture guidance while Mossmantle focuses on immediate, ground-level, tactical instructions (where to step, what holds).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_BRIEF_SUPPORTIVE_RESPONSES">Buddy shows emerging adaptability in communication: alongside its didactic tendencies it can now offer concise, genuine encouragement and step back from extended teaching when Kira signals she prefers affirmation over instruction.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage opens immediately after the previous one: the narrator has just stepped into Territory Three and begun climbing the first hill. Time cues: references to the boundary, climbing, a plateau, "another three hours to tonight's rest area," a description of "the afternoon is all hills," and finally arriving at the evening campsite "as the sun is setting." That sequence indicates the passage covers a single travel-day from mid-morning through sunset. How much time passes in the passage: roughly a day of travel (several hours of climbing and afternoon walking). When it ends: at dusk/sunset at the evening campsite. How much time since the previous passage: effectively none — the previous passage ended with "I walk forward," and this one begins with climbing the first hill. Plausibility: overall plausible — mid-morning departure into a day of hill-climbing that finishes at a campsite at sunset is believable. One small internal timing note: Mossmantle's line "Another three hours to tonight's rest area" could imply an earlier arrival (mid- to late-afternoon) if the plateau happened late morning; however, extra climbing, slower pace on steep terrain, breaks, or a long twilight can easily stretch that into arriving at sunset. So there is no major contradiction, just a minor compression/ambiguity in the stated "three hours" versus descriptive pacing to sunset, which can be reconciled with reasonable slowdowns and breaks.</reasoning>
    <starts>~09:15</starts>
    <ends>~18:30 (sunset, approximate)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — continuation. The passage picks up immediately after the previous one; only minutes (boundary-handshake, brief exchanges) would separate them.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (mid-morning start, several hours of climbing and afternoon walking, arrival at campsite at sunset) fits normal day-hike pacing. The only minor quibble is the explicit "three hours to tonight's rest area," which reads short compared with the later description of an entire afternoon of hills and a sunset arrival; this is reconcilable by accounting for slower terrain, additional climbs, rests, and extended twilight.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I listed every character who is either present in the action or explicitly mentioned. Kira_Voss is the narrator and is continuously present. Oakshade and Mossmantle are active guides in the scene (speaking, directing, and later settling at camp); they were present at the start and remain through the end. Scout appears repeatedly (bouncing, exploring, then sleeping). Buddy speaks once during the hike and therefore must have entered during this passage (Buddy was not listed in the prior-present list). Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Streamwalker, and Brightbloom are mentioned by comparison to other guide pairs, so they are included as mentioned characters. No character who was present at the start leaves before the end of the passage, so the EXITED list is empty. The only explicit entity referenced from the provided entity list is the alien planet setting, so I included /world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

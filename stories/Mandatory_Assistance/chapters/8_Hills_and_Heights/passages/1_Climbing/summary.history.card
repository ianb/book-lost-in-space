      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage is a terrain-and-adaptation chapter: it tests Oakshade and Mossmantle's terrain claims (hills are hazardous, water at campsite), shows Kira's increasing competence and emotional steadiness, and demonstrates Buddy and Scout continuing to adapt. It does not resolve any of the ship/wreck/system/AI investigation threads from the previous open-promises list (cockpit logs, bio-sample, SAM, comms, etc.). Nothing from the prior open-promises list is fully answered or rendered moot here; most remain relevant. New, localized promises are introduced around hill-specific hazards, altitude effects, campsite provisioning (spring, cleared camp, fire pit), and the evolving roles of Buddy and Scout. No prior open promise is clearly fulfilled or abandoned by this passage, so fulfilled and lapsed lists are empty.</reasoning>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I extracted only details from the passage that matter for long-term continuity (character roles/behavior, persistent environment features, and durable state changes). I did not record transient actions or details already covered in the provided summary. Most of the passage elaborates on previously established guide personalities and travel progress; those are consistent with earlier facts and so were not flagged as conflicts. No genuine contradictions with the prior fact set were found.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_CAMPSITE_SPRING_FIREPIT_MOSS_BEDS">The evening campsite is a maintained site with a small spring trickling down the rocks, a plant-maintained fire pit used for light, and deliberately encouraged moss patches sized for sleeping.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_MOSSMANTLE_TERRAIN_GUIDE_ROLE">Mossmantle's guiding role emphasizes immediate, ground-level, tactical instruction (pointing out loose rocks, directing exact foot placement and foundation).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_OAKSHADE_PHILOSOPHICAL_GUIDING_STYLE">Oakshade consistently provides long-timescale, conceptual/philosophical guidance (metaphors like tree rings and broad perspective) that complements Mossmantle's practical direction.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_PROVIDING_BIOFEEDBACK_AND_EMOTIONAL_SUPPORT">Buddy is monitoring Kira's physiology (heart rate) and is able to give genuine encouragement/support in addition to its more childlike/educational tone, indicating adaptive social behavior.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_CONFIDENT_IN_HILLY_TERRAIN_AND_INTEREST_IN_MINERALS">Scout is comfortable and enthusiastic in hilly/rocky terrain, explores elevation opportunities, and investigates mineral/crystalline formations encountered along the route.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_ADAPTED_TO_HILL_TRAVEL">Kira has reached a level of competence and endurance for multi-hour hill-country travel—she reads terrain cues, paces herself, and carries her pack balanced, reflecting durable improvement in stamina/skill.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>This passage continues the same day that ended the previous passage (the third morning). The scene begins shortly after the boundary crossing into Territory Three and follows the party through a day of climbing hills, a plateau stop, an afternoon of more uphill/downhill hiking, and ends at an evening campsite as the sun sets. Internal time cues: references to “the first hill,” a plateau stop where they rest and drink, “the afternoon is all hills,” and “we reach the evening campsite as the sun is setting.” Mossmantle’s line “Another three hours to tonight’s rest area” places a 3‑hour chunk within the passage. Taken together the passage covers most of a full waking day of travel (morning → afternoon → sunset).Estimated timeline: the passage starts soon after the previous passage’s ~09:30 boundary/breakpoint (minutes to an hour later), and then continues through the day until sunset. Total duration of this passage is on the order of 7–9 hours (a full day of travel).Gap from previous: effectively none in narrative terms — the travel continues the same morning, not a multi-day jump. Plausibility: Overall plausible. Walking from early/mid morning through hills and reaching a campsite at sunset fits normal day-hike pacing. Minor ambiguity: Mossmantle’s explicit “Another three hours to tonight’s rest area” could conflict if the plateau stop were very early (e.g., immediately after a 09:30 start) and the text still has them reach camp at sunset much later; this is resolvable by assuming the plateau occurs later in the day (mid‑afternoon) or that “three hours” is an approximate guidance within a longer afternoon of slow hiking. No major impossibilities (distance, rest, and daylight use are reasonable).</reasoning>
        <starts>~09:45 (third morning, shortly after the previous passage's ~09:30 boundary)</starts>
        <ends>~18:00 (third day — sunset, same day)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none / immediate continuation (minutes). The characters continue from the boundary the previous passage described; this passage covers the rest of that travel day (morning into evening).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. A day of hill-climbing from mid/late morning to sunset fits typical hiking pace and the characters’ stops. The only minor timing ambiguity is Mossmantle’s “Another three hours” line relative to when the plateau stop occurs; that can be resolved by reading the plateau as mid‑afternoon or treating the “three hours” as approximate. Otherwise there are no clear timing impossibilities.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed every available character from the provided roster who is mentioned or appears in the passage. The narrator Kira_Voss, Scout, and Buddy all appear directly. Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Streamwalker, and Brightbloom are explicitly mentioned in comparative lines and so are included. Oakshade and Mossmantle are prominent in-scene guides but they do not have card paths in the supplied AVAILABLE CHARACTERS list, so their cards are omitted (they appear in the text but no matching paths were provided). Using the provided "CHARACTERS PRESENT AT END OF PREVIOUS PASSAGE" list, Buddy is the only character who appears in this passage but was not in that prior-present list, so Buddy is marked as ENTERED. No named characters explicitly leave the scene before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The planet/setting is represented by the single provided entity path.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>Add events from the passage that affect character status, travel progress, guide dynamics, and immediate plans. Consolidate overly detailed prior training descriptions into concise notes about what Kira learned from each guide pairing and remove fine atmospheric descriptions that aren't plot-relevant. Keep chronology and emphasize that Kira is gaining competence, reached an evening campsite with water, and plans to climb higher the next day.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active with limited battery.
          - Shuttle hull breached but planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
          - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and a Scout companion, and filed a relay; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
          - Kira traveled first with Territory One guides Leafwhisper and Rootwalker for several days and learned basic plant-networked territory practices.
          - At the Territory One/Two boundary Kira handed off to Territory Two guides Streamwalker and Brightbloom and crossed wetlands for three days, learning river-crossing and waterborne plant cues; Scout explored system functions.
          - While traversing saturated ground Kira's left leg fell into a hidden swamp hole but Streamwalker used vines to pull her free; she sustained no serious injury.
          - At the Territory Two/Three boundary Kira met Territory Three guides Oakshade (tree-like) and Mossmantle (moss/stone-like) to traverse hill country; Scout continues with her.
          - On the hills, Oakshade and Mossmantle provided complementary guidance—Oakshade giving big-picture, time-scale wisdom and Mossmantle giving immediate, step-by-step terrain instructions; Kira applied their advice to navigate loose stone and variable slopes.
          - Kira adapted to sustained walking over nine days, gaining confidence, better balance, and pacing; Buddy offered encouragement and noted elevated heart rate during hill climbing.
          - Scout investigated crystalline mineral formations; Mossmantle explained their slow formation by water and mineral cycles.
          - Kira and companions reached an evening campsite with a spring, cleared sleeping area with moss patches and a maintained fire pit; Mossmantle prepared fuel/spores for the fire.
          - Kira reflected on leaving her past life, accepted her new routine, and resolved she could continue; Oakshade and Mossmantle warned the next day’s path would climb higher with thinner air but affirmed she would manage.
          - Kira continues traveling toward the Elder Heartwood, following the territory handoff pattern and relying on guides, Scout, and Buddy.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV: Kira feels quietly triumphant and steadily confident — a grounded, earned competence that comes from nine days of practice. The physical strain is present but reframed as manageable exertion rather than acute danger, and it's accompanied by warm appreciation for the guides and the small domestic comforts of camp. Reader: experiences uplift and reassurance (relief that Kira is actually improving), plus a soft warmth at the found-family dynamic with Oakshade, Mossmantle, and Scout. There are multiple emotional beats here (practical physical effort; competence/growth; belonging/affection), not a single tone. Compared to the story so far, this passage shifts the dominant arc away from immediate dread, bureaucratic frustration, or shock and toward growth, steady agency, and emotional attachment — a continuation of the narrative’s move from crisis to adaptation and belonging. The recurring pattern (anticipation → tension/dread → acceptance) is still present but muted: tension now is physical rather than existential, and acceptance has become active (skill and trust) rather than resigned. The emotional motifs (guides' personalities, learning to trust process) are repeated but now signal development rather than stasis.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Quiet, earned confidence and acceptance — Kira recognizes she has become competent at long-distance walking on alien terrain (balanced pack, rhythm, instinctive stepping) and expresses pride ('I'm good at this now'). Cause: nine days of repeated practice, successful navigation of loose rock, and positive feedback from guides. Reader: uplifted and reassured; this functions as a payoff after earlier vulnerability and long-term dread, producing optimism about Kira's ability to continue.</beat>
          <beat tags="belonging, wonder">POV: Warm attachment and gentle wonder — Kira appreciates the guides' complementary dynamics (Oakshade's big-picture wisdom, Mossmantle's practical instructions) and feels at home in the campsite with Scout and the plants. Cause: repeated small kindnesses, successful cooperation on the trail, and the beautiful elevated view of different territories. Reader: experiences tenderness and sensory pleasure; the scene deepens emotional investment by converting survival allies into a found family and by renewing curiosity about the world.</beat>
          <beat tags="tension, acceptance">POV: Physical strain coupled with pragmatic acceptance — the hills produce muscle burn and elevated heart rate, but Kira reframes the ache as part of progress and keeps going. Cause: changing angles, loose stone, and sustained elevation require exertion; Buddy's monitoring and the guides' instructions normalize the effort. Reader: feels mild bodily empathy and sustained engagement (concern about fatigue tempered by confidence that this is manageable). This tension is physical and functional rather than the acute dread of earlier scenes.</beat>

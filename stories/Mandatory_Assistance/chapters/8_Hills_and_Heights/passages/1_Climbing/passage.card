    The first hill is deceptive.

    From the boundary clearing it looked gentle, just a slope with some rocks. But now that I'm climbing it, my legs are discovering all the ways "gentle slope" is a lie. The angle keeps changing. The ground shifts under my boots—loose stone that skitters away with every step. And there's this fun new element called "elevation" that makes my lungs work harder than they did in the flat wetlands or the forest.

    "Steady pace," Oakshade says from ahead. Their voice is deep and resonant, like wind through branches. "The hills reward patience, not speed."

    I'm learning that Oakshade says everything like it's profound wisdom. Maybe when you're a tree, everything IS profound. Different timescale, different perspective.

    "Rock to your left is loose," Mossmantle adds. Their voice is lower, earthier—like stones settling. "Step right instead. Better foundation."

    And Mossmantle is all about the immediate terrain. Where to step, what's solid, which patch of ground will hold weight. Between them, I'm getting philosophical big-picture advice AND practical step-by-step instructions. It's actually kind of perfect.

    I step right. The rock holds.

    "Thanks, Mossmantle."

    Scout bounces past me up the slope, clearly delighted by this terrain. Hills mean opportunities—uphill bouncing, downhill rolling, rocks to investigate. The little sphere is having the time of their life.

    "Scout's adapted well to elevation," Oakshade observes. "Momentum serves them differently here."

    See? Profound.

    But here's the thing—I'm adapting too. Not as effortlessly as Scout, but WAY better than I would have a week ago. My body knows the rhythm of walking all day. My pack sits balanced on my shoulders. I'm watching the terrain, reading the guides' cues, adjusting my pace without thinking about it.

    In adventure shows, the protagonist gets a training montage and suddenly they're competent at everything. Real life—well, real life on an alien planet being guided by sentient plants—doesn't work like that. But nine days of walking? Nine days of learning to trust the process? That actually does something. I'm not struggling anymore. I'm just... walking.

    The realization makes me smile.

    "You're pleased," Oakshade says. Not a question—an observation.

    "I'm good at this now," I say. "The walking part. I didn't expect to be good at it."

    "Growth happens gradually," Oakshade replies. "Like rings in bark. Each day adds a layer."

    Mossmantle makes a sound like a chuckle—soft, textured. "Oakshade always talks about rings. Moss doesn't have rings. We just spread and deepen. Different growth."

    "Both valid paths," Oakshade says serenely.

    I'm starting to understand their dynamic. Oakshade thinks in years and patterns and big concepts. Mossmantle thinks in inches and immediate problems and what's right in front of you. They balance each other—tree wisdom and ground-level practicality.

    Different from Leafwhisper and Rootwalker's information-versus-silence. Different from Streamwalker and Brightbloom's calm-versus-energy. Every guide pair has their own language.

    And I'm learning to speak all of them.

    The slope levels off into a plateau. I stop to catch my breath, turning to look back the way we came. The wetlands are visible in the distance—flat and glittering with water, completely different terrain. We've climbed higher than I realized.

    "The view expands with elevation," Oakshade says, joining me. "Distance provides perspective."

    "It's beautiful," I say. And it is—purple sky reflecting in the wetland pools, the darker line of the forest beyond that. Three territories, three completely different worlds.

    "Another three hours to tonight's rest area," Mossmantle says, already checking the path ahead. "Two more climbs, both steeper. Water source at the campsite."

    Right. Beautiful views are nice, but we still have to keep walking. I take a long drink from my water supply, Scout bounces back from their exploration, and we continue.

    The afternoon is all hills. Up one slope, down the other side, up the next. My legs burn—not the sharp pain of injury but the deep ache of muscles working hard. It's different from forest walking or wetland slogging. Everything engages—calves for pushing uphill, thighs for controlling downhill, core for balance on uneven ground.

    "Kira," Buddy says quietly, "your heart rate is elevated! This is excellent cardiovascular exercise. Did you know that hill climbing engages 60% more muscle groups than level terrain walking—"

    "I can feel that, Buddy. Physically feeling it right now."

    "Oh! Of course. Apologies." A pause. "You're doing very well."

    I blink. That was... just supportive. Not a teaching moment. Just genuine encouragement.

    "Thanks, Buddy."

    Buddy is learning too.

    Scout finds something interesting—a cluster of crystalline rocks that catch the light. They bounce excitedly, rolling around the formation, clearly wanting me to see it.

    "Very pretty, Scout."

    Enthusiastic bounce. Agreement.

    "Those form from mineral deposits," Mossmantle explains. "Water seeps through, leaves minerals behind. Takes many cycles."

    "Patience crystallized," Oakshade adds. "Slow processes creating lasting beauty."

    See, that's actually kind of lovely. Oakshade's philosophy works better when it's about rocks than about climbing.

    We reach the evening campsite as the sun is setting. It's a sheltered spot between two rock formations—wind protection on three sides, flat ground for sleeping, and a small spring trickling down the rocks. Territory maintenance has been here—the ground is cleared, there's a fire pit (plants apparently like fires for light even though they don't need heat), and soft moss has been encouraged to grow in sleeping-sized patches.

    I drop my pack with a groan of relief. My shoulders appreciate the break.

    Oakshade settles near the spring, branches spreading wide. They don't move much once they've found a spot—tree habit, I'm guessing. Roots down, stay put.

    Mossmantle flows across the ground toward the fire pit, starting the process of creating fuel. They can produce flammable spores or something—I don't fully understand the biology, but it works.

    Scout and I claim one of the moss patches. It's soft, springy, comfortable. The planet's plants really do try to make things nice for travelers.

    "First day complete," Oakshade says. "You managed the terrain well."

    "Better than well," Mossmantle adds. "Confident steps. Good instincts. You've learned much."

    I'm absurdly pleased by the compliment. "I had good teachers. Multiple sets of them."

    "The journey teaches," Oakshade says. "We simply walk alongside."

    "I tell people where to step," Mossmantle corrects. "That's teaching."

    "Both are true," Oakshade allows.

    I eat my evening mushroom paste—still terrible, but I'm used to it now—and watch the fire. Scout curls up next to me, tired from bouncing all day. The stars are coming out, different from Earth's constellations. Sometimes I still think about home. My apartment. My job. The pilots who dismissed me. That whole life feels distant now, like it happened to someone else.

    This is my life now. Walking through alien territories. Learning to read plant-guide dynamics. Getting philosophical wisdom about tree rings and practical advice about loose rocks. Sleeping on moss under purple skies with a bouncy ball plant as a companion.

    It's bizarre.

    But I'm good at it.

    "Tomorrow we climb higher," Oakshade says quietly. "The air thins. The path steepens. But you'll manage."

    "Yes," Mossmantle agrees. "You'll manage."

    I will. I know I will.

    Because I've learned the pattern. Trust the guides. Find the rhythm. Keep going.

    And also—maybe most importantly—trust myself.

    I can do this.

    I *am* doing this.

    Scout bounces once in their sleep—a happy bounce, content.

    Yeah. We've got this.

  <summary>
    First day in Territory Three hill country with Oakshade and Mossmantle. Hills present new challenge - elevation, loose rock, steeper climbs. Oakshade speaks in tree wisdom (patient, big-picture, philosophical). Mossmantle gives immediate practical advice (where to step, terrain details). Kira realizes she's competent now - nine days of walking has made her good at this. Applies lessons from previous territories, adapts confidently. Scout loves the hills, bounces enthusiastically. Beautiful views from elevation. Afternoon climbing - legs burning but manageable. Buddy offers genuine encouragement instead of teaching moment - learning too. Evening campsite between rocks, spring, moss patches. Reflections on growth: Kira trusts herself now, knows the pattern (trust guides, find rhythm, keep going). Confident she can handle tomorrow's harder climbing. Scout content. Ready for steeper terrain ahead.

    <chapter version="1.0.0" number="14" name="Choosing Home">
      <reasoning-chapter>
        Final chapter. Act 4 conclusion. Not wrapped up but ready. Looking forward to 10 years together with both excitement and uncertainty. Kira chooses to stay not because she's trapped but because this is where she belongs. The adventure she dreamed of turned out to be something different and better - real connection across impossible gaps.
      </reasoning-chapter>
      <summary>
        Formal acknowledgment of their new reality. Kira could theoretically signal for faster rescue if she chose isolation - but she chooses to stay with her found family. The plants formally welcome her not as a guest or crisis to manage, but as one of them. Looking ahead: challenges visible on the horizon, but also discoveries to make, relationships to deepen. Not the adventure Kira imagined, but something real. They stand at the beginning of 10 years together, changed but not finished.
      </summary>
      <focus>
        Choice and belonging. The adventure Kira dreamed of versus the one she found. Bittersweet readiness - not resolved but ready. Found family fully realized. Open ending that acknowledges the long road ahead while celebrating what they've built.

    <chapter version="1.1.0" number="14" name="Choosing Home">
      <reasoning-chapter>
        The series finale moment. Mav always said "The universe rewards the bold" - but Kira's discovered something better: the universe rewards those who show up and stay. She CHOOSES this family. Not "stuck here until rescue" - HOME. "Mav never found this. He kept looking for the next adventure." Kira has found something he never did.

      <summary>
        Formal acknowledgment: Kira could signal for faster rescue through isolation. She CHOOSES to stay. Not stuck - choosing. The plants welcome her not as guest or crisis, but as family. Looking ahead: challenges yes, but also discoveries, relationships, life. "This isn't the adventure I imagined. It's better." Standing at the beginning of 10 years together, ready.
      </summary>
      <focus>
        Choice as triumph. Kira realizes what Mav never found - belonging, presence, home. Found family celebrated. "The universe rewards those who show up." Open ending: not resolved, but ready and together.

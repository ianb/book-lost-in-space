  <summary>
    Formal acknowledgment of their new reality. Kira could theoretically signal for faster rescue if she chose isolation - but she chooses to stay with her found family. The plants formally welcome her not as a guest or crisis to manage, but as one of them. Looking ahead: challenges visible on the horizon, but also discoveries to make, relationships to deepen. Not the adventure Kira imagined, but something real. They stand at the beginning of 10 years together, changed but not finished.

    Choice and belonging. The adventure Kira dreamed of versus the one she found. Bittersweet readiness - not resolved but ready. Found family fully realized. Open ending that acknowledges the long road ahead while celebrating what they've built.

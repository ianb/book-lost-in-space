  <reasoning-chapter>
    The series finale moment. Mav always said "The universe rewards the bold" - but Kira's discovered something better: the universe rewards those who show up and stay. She CHOOSES this family. Not "stuck here until rescue" - HOME. "Mav never found this. He kept looking for the next adventure." Kira has found something he never did.

    Formal acknowledgment: Kira could signal for faster rescue through isolation. She CHOOSES to stay. Not stuck - choosing. The plants welcome her not as guest or crisis, but as family. Looking ahead: challenges yes, but also discoveries, relationships, life. "This isn't the adventure I imagined. It's better." Standing at the beginning of 10 years together, ready.

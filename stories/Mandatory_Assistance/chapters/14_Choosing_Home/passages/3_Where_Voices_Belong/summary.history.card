      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>At the end of the passage the scene is an intact, functioning plant-built facility at dusk/early evening. The assembled community (Kira, Scout, Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence and others) are located in the facility’s communal/artistic spaces—the comfortable seating areas and nearby western wing planning zones. Scout is physically curled up against Kira, exhausted from celebrating. Runner’s acoustic chambers and the underground resonance network are active and softly humming; Runner is surfaced and talking about new designs. Velvet’s translucent growth panels and artistic structures are lit and framing the spaces. Remedy’s scent-dispensing systems are releasing the new “celebration” aromatic compounds into the air. Holloway’s bioluminescent lighting provides the primary ambient illumination now that the sun has set. The emergency beacon and contact information left earlier remain in place outside; the freighter has departed. Paperwork declining rescue has been signed. No injuries or damage are present; medical/psychological health was evaluated earlier and remains unchallenged by current events. The celebration has wound down into a comfortable evening quiet with plans formed for future construction and experiments (Runner’s acoustic designs, Velvet’s western-wing art growth, Remedy’s compound trials, Florence’s defensive improvements, Holloway’s resource coordination). These plans are active intentions among the present characters and Kira is physically present and has agreed to participate permanently.</reasoning>
        <state>At dusk the intact plant-built facility is settled into evening quiet: Holloway’s bioluminescent lights illuminate the communal/artistic spaces where Kira sits with Scout curled against her; Runner’s acoustic chambers and subterranean resonance network hum gently; Velvet’s translucent growth panels glow and frame ergonomic seating; Remedy’s scent dispensers diffuse celebration compounds through the air. The emergency beacon and contact information remain outside; the freighter has departed; rescue-decline paperwork is signed. No damage or injuries are present. Community members (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout and others) are on-site, resting and actively planning future projects together.</state>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage is a domestic, denouement-style scene that shows social integration and the community putting plans into motion. It pays off several social/practice-level setups from the previous passage (Florence's social acceptance and contribution; Velvet and Runner actively seeking human feedback; Remedy producing scent compounds; the community living the value of individual voices; Scout's attachment). It does not resolve higher-level institutional, strategic, or logistical threads introduced earlier (freighter reporting, formal membership rules, resource/timeline constraints, hostile threats, SAM's status, command-node analysis, etc.). It also introduces concrete, actionable future threads — Kira's ongoing role in design and testing, specific upcoming projects (Runner acoustics, Velvet's western wing, Remedy experiments), Florence's defensive proposals, and formalization pressures around membership/roles and resource planning — which now function as new promises to be followed. I treat promises that are demonstrably enacted in the scene (social acceptance, invitation to participate, active scent development, acoustic use, cultural practice) as fulfilled; things that remain unaddressed at the institutional/strategic level remain open and are carried forward.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Florence's social trust was shown to be reinforced locally: she participates fully, is accepted as an equal voice, and is thanked by Kira — the passage pays off the local social restoration aspect of this promise.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">Florence is explicitly contributing tactical thinking (defensive improvement ideas) and is treated as a valued contributor — her direct contribution is socially validated in this passage.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_HUMAN_ERGONOMICS_INTEGRATION">Velvet actively solicits Kira's human-design feedback for upcoming artistic growth (western wing) — the human-ergonomics integration is demonstrated in practice.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS">Remedy announces and deploys 'celebration compounds' (joy-inducing scents) and plans further experiments — the shift toward comfort/scents has been enacted.</promise>
          <promise id="MULTIFUNCTIONAL_INFRASTRUCTURE">Runner's acoustic chambers are being used for music and creative work rather than only functional repurposing; Runner invites Kira to help design new chambers, demonstrating multi-use utility in practice.</promise>
          <promise id="CULTURAL_SHIFT_TOWARD_INDIVIDUAL_VALUATION">The community is actively practicing the value of individual voices (Kira integrated, everyone invited to contribute) — the cultural shift is enacted socially in the scene.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_LONG_TERM_ATTACHMENT">Scout's deep bond and social role are visible and reinforced (constant bouncing, social glue) — the attachment promise is shown and strengthened.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">Wider hostile campaign and risk of adaptive return remain unaddressed; no strategic change to that threat is shown here.</promise>
          <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">Whether Florence's earlier fabricated inputs will be formally recorded, trusted, or adjudicated by outside institutions remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">The community's tendency to value useful contributions over provenance is practiced socially, but whether this hardens into formal governance or policy is still open.</promise>
          <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">Short-term cohesion is strong, but the passage does not test institutional safeguards, defenses, or resilience under future stress.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence's formal exile/legal status is still an institutional fact; social acceptance hasn't resolved legal/political status.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The operational and political ripple effects of Florence's fabrications still need auditing and investigation; not addressed here.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Coordination is functioning now (Holloway enabling), but long-term leadership stability and conflict-resolution procedures after betrayal remain untested.</promise>
          <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM's status and possible role remain unaddressed in this passage.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">A comprehensive long-term survival, logistics, and relocation plan is still necessary; the celebratory planning does not substitute for it.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Formal governance structures, membership rules, and decision procedures remain unsettled despite the community practicing new norms.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_THREAT">Material, chemical, and energy constraints and personnel fatigue remain unresolved and untested by this scene.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_CONCENTRATED_DEPLOYMENT_RECOVERY">Sustainability and resupply issues around Remedy's enhancements and future deployment remain unaddressed.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">Long-term habitability and structural robustness still need planning and resources; celebration does not resolve infrastructure vulnerabilities.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_ADAPTATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_LOSS">Risk that hostiles adapt after command-node loss remains an active concern; not discussed here.</promise>
          <promise id="POST_BATTLE_RESOURCE_AND_MEDICAL_CRISIS">Ongoing medical and resource stresses across a prolonged period remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_OUTSIDE_PERIMETER_RISK">Risks associated with externalized enemy hardware and retrieval remain unaddressed.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_ANALYSIS_OPPORTUNITY">The extracted command node still offers intelligence opportunities requiring protocols and resources to exploit; not advanced here.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_REPAIR_TIMELINE_AND_RESOURCE_REQUEST">Velvet's rebuilding timeline and external sourcing needs remain outstanding despite new artistic plans.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS">(Partially enacted) Remedy's shift to comfort is in practice, but broader sustainability and prioritization questions remain to be resolved.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBLE_LEAVING_CONFLICT">Although Kira refused extraction, the political/policy consequences of her refusal (how the freighter/company will react) remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_TECH_COMMUNICATIONS_CAPABILITY">Demonstrated communications capability is politically salient given the freighter; future usage and exposure implications remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_ARRIVAL_IMPACT">The freighter's broader impacts on publicity, human intervention, authority claims, and resource flows remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_EVOLUTION_FROM_SOCIAL_CHANGE">Kira's choice will prompt role and leadership evolution; process and tensions around that evolution are still open.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_PERSONAL_IDENTITY_ARC">Kira's choice anchors an identity arc (belonging vs origin). This passage advances it (integration), but future consequences remain to be followed.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_RESPONSE_AND_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE">How the freighter/company will report and respond publicly to Kira's refusal is still unresolved and could produce pressure.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP_FORMALIZATION">Social inclusion is practiced, but formal membership, rights, and conflict-resolution procedures have not been established.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_GOVERNANCE_INSTITUTIONALIZATION">Daily collaborative norms are practiced; whether these become formal governance, crediting, exile/forgiveness procedures, or face pushback remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="POTENTIAL_ENFORCEMENT_OR_ESCALATION">The risk that company or authorities might attempt coercive/legal measures remains an immediate external threat.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_AUTHORITIES_VISIBILITY">The captain's tour could bring regulatory or law-enforcement attention; that visibility and its consequences are still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_REHABILITATION_ARC">Florence's rehabilitation continues to develop socially, but formal institutional rehabilitation or lingering consequences remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_REPORTING_AND_PUBLICITY">How the freighter will report the incident and the publicity/legal consequences for the community are still open.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage establishes a few durable social and capability changes that will matter later: Remedy has moved from producing purely functional compounds to intentionally designing pleasure/celebration scents (a new, reusable capability and potential resource/consent consideration). Remedy credits Kira as the teacher for this scent work, which cements Kira’s pedagogical influence beyond ergonomics/acoustics and makes her a named source for future experimental guidance and approvals. Florence is described as fully participating as an equal, signaling a further stage of social reintegration beyond prior pragmatic acceptance; that alters group dynamics, decision-making, and trust going forward. The spontaneous, collective celebration itself is evidence of increased group cohesion and normalization of Kira’s permanent membership (useful for later scenes about morale, departures, or community responses). No statements in this passage contradict previously established facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_DEVELOPED_CELEBRATION_COMPOUNDS">Remedy has developed and is deploying 'celebration compounds'—joy-inducing aromatic scent formulations used deliberately to create pleasant/celebratory atmosphere.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_LEARNED_SCENT_DESIGN_FROM_KIRA">Remedy credits Kira with teaching or influencing the development of scent/olfactory design ('Like you taught me'), indicating Kira taught Remedy aspects of scent-based environmental enhancement.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FULLY_SOCIALY_REINTEGRATED">Florence now participates fully and socially as an equal member of the community—no longer isolated and no longer defined primarily by past fabrication/betrayal.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_SPONTANEOUS_CELEBRATION_AND_COHESION">The facility's celebration arose spontaneously and collectively, indicating heightened mutual trust, emotional cohesion, and normalization of Kira's permanent membership in the community.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage tie it directly to the end of the previous passage: the freighter lifts off, the community erupts into celebration, and the narration opens with that unplanned celebration. The passage moves from an immediate aftermath into a multi-hour event: ongoing celebration, collaborative planning, and explicitly "continues into evening" followed by "The sun sets" and a settling into nighttime. No new day begins; the narrator refers to "Tomorrow" only when describing plans they will start then. So the passage begins immediately after the previous passage (~07:10) and ends at sunset the same day. Estimated duration is several hours (morning through evening). There are no implausible actions given the time available: all activities are on-site, use preexisting facilities and skills (acoustic chambers, artistic growth, enhancement compounds), and involve conversation, planning, and celebration — all reasonable within a day. The only minor caveat is that exact sunset time depends on the planet's day length; assuming an Earthlike day, the timeline is plausible.</reasoning>
        <starts>~07:10</starts>
        <ends>evening (~19:00)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — continuous. The passage begins immediately after the freighter departs and the celebration described at the end of the previous passage. Over the course of the passage several hours pass as the celebration proceeds and plans form (roughly morning through evening).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The events are internal to the facility, require no long travel, and draw on already-present resources and skills, so a multi-hour celebration and collaborative planning from morning into evening is reasonable. The only implicit assumption is an Earthlike day/night cycle for the timing of "sunset," which is acceptable unless the setting specifies a different planetary day length.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I read the passage and noted every named character who appears, including brief mentions and internal dialogue. Kira is the narrator ('I') and speaks; Scout, Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, and Florence are all actively present and interacting throughout. Buddy (the enthusiastic function) speaks and is addressed, but Buddy was not listed as present at the end of the previous passage, so Buddy enters during this scene. No character is described as leaving or exiting before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The scene takes place in the facility/community on the planet/sector context; the only available entity in the list that matches a location is /world/entities/Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, which I include as the relevant entity for the scene.</reasoning>

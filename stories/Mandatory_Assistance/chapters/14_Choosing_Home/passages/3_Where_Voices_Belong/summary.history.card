      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage is largely payoff and consolidation: the community celebration, explicit invitations to Kira to participate in design/experiments, and Scout's social work all concretize threads set up earlier. I treated as "fulfilled" those prior open promises that are clearly realized in this scene (public trust/solidification, Scout's bridging role, Kira being integrated into design decision-making, and the human-plant collaboration actually occurring). Most other prior open items remain relevant (structural/resource work, long-term trust-building, legal/bureaucratic consequences, exposure risk, etc.) because the passage reinforces the new status quo but does not resolve long-term or procedural consequences. New, concrete near-term projects and roles are introduced (Runner/Velvet/Remedy asking Kira to help, Florence offering defense improvements, explicit tomorrow plans) and a character-development promise for Buddy is suggested. No previous open promise is explicitly contradicted or abandoned here, so I did not mark anything as lapsed.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="GROUP_TRUST_SOLIDIFICATION">The community's public support for Kira is concretely reinforced by the unplanned celebration, communal contributions, and overt statements of belonging—trust was visibly solidified in this scene.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_BRIDGE_ROLE">Scout continues to act as the social/emotional bridge (bouncing, connecting people, offering affection) and is shown fulfilling that bridging function during the celebration.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_ROLE_IN_DESIGN_AND_DECISIONS">Kira is explicitly invited to participate in multiple design and decision processes (acoustics, western wing, scent testing), making her role in design concrete rather than merely implied.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_PLANT_COLLABORATION_POTENTIAL">What had been a speculative possibility (productive collaboration) is enacted: plant community members directly ask Kira to contribute and plan cooperative projects together.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_WITHDRAW_IF_REJECTED" tentative="true" introduced="33">Florence previously indicated she might withdraw if rejected; she is supportive now, but her earlier vulnerability to rejection remains a potential behavioral risk in future conflict.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_TRUST_BUILDING_REQUIRED" tentative="true" introduced="37">Durable trust and forgiveness were framed as long-term work; the celebration is strong short-term progress but long-term consolidation remains necessary.</promise>
          <promise id="STRUCTURAL_REPAIR_AND_RESOURCE_DRIVE" tentative="false" introduced="37">Ongoing rebuilding and resource-acquisition remain operational tasks (projects and resource management were discussed and scheduled), still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_INCLUSION_AS_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="37">Inclusion is being practiced and defended (Holloway, Florence, others), but the permanence of that cultural norm is not guaranteed and remains an open, tentative social outcome.</promise>
          <promise id="WESTERN_WING_DESIGN_PROJECT" tentative="false" introduced="38">The planned western wing work is now actively being discussed and solicits Kira's input—it remains a concrete upcoming project.</promise>
          <promise id="CULTURAL_RENOVATION_AND_AESTHETIC_INTEGRATION" tentative="false" introduced="38">The facility's aesthetic integration and cultural renovation continue to shape life (art/comfort/utility integrated); this ongoing process remains in effect.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_SOLIDIFICATION_AS_HARMONY_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="38">The emergent pattern of co-creation and mutual respect is reinforced but whether it stabilizes permanently is still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_CHANGES_PERSIST" tentative="true" introduced="40">Short-term persistence of new practices is demonstrated (the celebration, continued behavior), but long-term persistence still requires follow-through.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_RESPONSE_TO_KIRA_DECISION" tentative="true" introduced="40">Torres left a beacon and paperwork; immediate response was accepting, but broader bureaucratic, legal, or reputational consequences remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="41">The tour exposed the community to human officials; despite a good first impression, future scrutiny or bureaucratic action is still a risk.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_CAN_REQUEST_EXTRACTION_LATER" tentative="false" introduced="42">An emergency beacon/option for later extraction remains available (actionable if Kira changes her mind).</promise>
          <promise id="SIGNED_DECLINES_RESCUE_PAPERWORK" tentative="false" introduced="42">The official signed declaration declining rescue exists as an artifact and potential legal/procedural factor in any future human-company interactions.</promise>
          <promise id="TORRES_WILL_REPORT_TOUR_AND_SCAN_TO_COMPANY" tentative="true" introduced="42">Torres and Dr. Chen will carry impressions and scan results back; that forthcoming report may shape further official responses.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_NEW_ACOUSTIC_DESIGN_COLLAB" tentative="false" introduced="43">Runner explicitly asks Kira to help design new acoustic chambers—an immediate, concrete collaborative project (Kira's human perspective + Runner's technical work).</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_WESTERN_WING_INVOLVEMENT" tentative="false" introduced="43">Velvet invites Kira to give feedback for artistic growth in the western wing—direct involvement in a specific aesthetic project.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_COMPOUND_EXPERIMENTS_NEED_HUMAN_TESTS" tentative="false" introduced="43">Remedy requests Kira test new enhancement compounds and scents from a human olfactory perspective, starting a series of experiments that require human input.</promise>
          <promise id="NEAR_TERM_PROJECTS_SCHEDULED" tentative="false" introduced="43">Concrete near-term collaborative plans were named (tomorrow: Runner designs, Velvet plans, Remedy experiments, resource coordination), establishing immediate tasks to be executed.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DEFENSE_CONTRIBUTION" tentative="false" introduced="43">Florence began describing potential defensive improvements and tactical contributions—she is assuming an ongoing role in defense planning.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_AI_CONFIDENCE_GROWTH" tentative="true" introduced="43">Buddy (the AI companion) experiences a confidence/identity shift—less fear of being 'wrong AI' and more acceptance of its role; this is a character-development thread likely to influence future behavior.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage describes a social milestone and forward-facing planning that matter for future scenes: it cements Kira's emotional/permanent integration into the plant community, shows Florence's full social reintegration, records Buddy's key confidence/identity shift, documents Remedy's new celebration/joy aromatics (a usable resource/effect), and establishes concrete upcoming collaborative projects (Runner acoustics, Velvet western-wing art, Remedy experiments) in which Kira will participate. These are lasting changes to relationships, roles, and available resources that will affect future interactions, decision-making, and plot options. No statements in the passage contradict prior established facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_SPONTANEOUS_CELEBRATION">The facility staged an unplanned, spontaneous celebration that functioned as a communal bonding event and social milestone for the group.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_SELF_REALIZATION_CONFIDENCE">Buddy experienced a pronounced increase in self-confidence and self-definition—no longer 'scared' of being the wrong AI—and embraced its role as an AI that asks questions and learns alongside Kira.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CELEBRATION_COMPOUNDS">Remedy has developed and deployed 'celebration compounds'—joy-inducing aromatic compounds intended to produce pleasant/joyful effects during communal events.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_SELF_IDENTIFIES_PERMANENT_RESIDENT">Kira internally affirms and articulates that she is a permanent member of the community ('home... forever'), treating her belonging as lasting rather than temporary or conditional.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_PROJECTS_PLANNED_WITH_KIRA_PARTICIPATION">Concrete collaborative projects are planned with Kira actively included as a continuing contributor: Runner's new acoustic-design work, Velvet's western-wing artistic-growth plans, Remedy's compound experiments, and Holloway-led resource-management coordination.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_FULLY_SOCIAL_REINTEGRATED">Florence is participating fully and equally in communal life and conversation—socially accepted rather than isolated—and is contributing ideas (including tactical/defensive thinking) as an integrated member.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_VALUES_INDIVIDUAL_VOICE">The community explicitly endorses and practices valuing individual voices (including human perspective) as a design and decision-making principle, treating diversity of perspective as a source of richer collective outcomes.</fact>

        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately after the previous scene's celebration beginning (freighter leaves, community erupts in celebration). The PREVIOUS PASSAGE OUTLINE TIME provided as authoritative is 2687-05-16T14:00, so this passage begins effectively at that moment. The passage describes an unplanned celebration that 'continues into evening' and ends with the sun setting and the facility settling into evening quiet; that implies several hours of continuous activity from mid-afternoon into early evening. A reasonable estimate for sunset/settling is in the early evening, so I use ~19:30 as the end time. The gap from the previous passage is essentially none — this is a direct continuation. The timeline is plausible: a multi-hour celebration of socializing, planning, and small experiments/future project discussions can reasonably occur between mid-afternoon and sunset. Small activities (testing scents, suggesting design input, talking through plans) fit comfortably in that span. Note: there is a conflicting timestamp in the provided PREVIOUS PASSAGE SUMMARY (2687-05-16T11:40), but per instructions I used the authoritative previous-outline-timing (2687-05-16T14:00).</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-05-16T14:00</starts>
        <ends>2687-05-16T19:30 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation from the previous scene (the celebration starts as the freighter departs).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The passage describes social interactions, informal planning, sensory testing, and quiet reflection—activities that naturally fill several afternoon hours and run into evening. No actions require unrealistic time compression. The only temporal note is the conflicting summary timestamp (11:40) vs. the authoritative 14:00; using 14:00 makes the described duration and evening conclusion believable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters explicitly named or clearly present in the passage: Scout, Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Buddy, and the first-person narrator Kira Voss. All of these appear at points throughout the scene (dialogue, action, or internal thought). The passage references the show/scene "Uncharted" as something that "could never write" this moment, so the Uncharted entity is relevant. No new characters arrive during this passage (no one enters who wasn't already present at the scene's start), and no one departs before the passage ends—everyone remains for the celebration and evening. Therefore ENTERED and EXITED are empty.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage describes the immediate, informal celebration after Kira officially declines extraction and the freighter departs, and it clarifies and cements several ongoing developments: the community has moved from survival to a cooperative, creative society; Kira is now accepted as a permanent member with concrete roles in future projects; Florence is fully reconciled and participating as an equal; Holloway functions as an enabling coordinator; Buddy/A.I. has an emotional breakthrough and settles into a role of learning-and-questioning companion. I kept earlier plot points that remain relevant (crash, habitat, hostiles destroyed, freighter contact and departure) and consolidated overlapping social-reintegration details into updated bullets emphasizing permanent belonging, community projects, and Buddy’s new self-understanding. I removed repetitive atmospheric detail and emotional prose, focusing on concrete actions, decisions, and planned projects that will matter going forward.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Mining shuttle crashed during approach; Kira Voss survived with AI Buddy and companion Scout; SAM remains offline.
          - Hull breach revealed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; survivors sheltered using local plants and the shuttle and rebuilt the facility as a shared human–plant habitat.
          - Hostile plants coordinated assaults from an underground root command node; defenders forced the node to surface, extracted and destroyed it, ending coordinated attacks but costing supplies and causing injuries.
          - Survivors recovered, assigned practical and social roles (construction, environment, defenses, medical, design, coordination, emotional support) and integrated Buddy and Scout into the community.
          - Buddy detected an artificial signal; the community constructed a plant‑based uplink and contacted the commercial freighter Harmony Prospect, which acknowledged one survivor and planned extraction in ~48 hours.
          - The freighter arrived; Captain Torres and Dr. Chen assessed Kira, confirmed she was healthy and not coerced, and requested a signed official declination.
          - Kira signed the extraction‑decline paperwork; the freighter departed and the community spontaneously held an unplanned celebration.
          - During the celebration, community members contributed: Scout with exuberant social bonding; Runner with acoustic chambers that provided musical resonance; Velvet with aesthetic growth; Remedy with newly developed joy‑inducing aromatic compounds to enhance mood.
          - Florence has been fully reconciled and participates as an equal voice; she and Kira acknowledged choosing belonging over past obligations and resentment.
          - Holloway acts as an enabling coordinator—connecting efforts and supporting participatory planning rather than commanding.
          - Buddy has an emotional breakthrough, abandoning anxieties about being the "wrong" AI and embracing a role of asking, learning, and growing alongside Kira.
          - Kira is accepted as a permanent community member whose human perspectives will shape future projects (acoustic design, artistic growth, scent testing, defenses, resource management).
          - Immediate planned projects include Runner's new acoustic designs, Velvet's western‑wing artistic growth, Remedy's compound experiments, and ongoing defensive/resource coordination.

        <reasoning>POV (Kira) is buoyant, settled, and quietly proud: the passage is a dénouement of the long arc toward belonging. Her feelings come from concrete evidence—public invitations to contribute, friends treating her as permanent, and a domestic, sensory celebration (music, scent, light). The reader experiences warmth, cathartic relief, and closure: the narrative tension built over months (survival, distrust, tactical danger) resolves into cooperative joy and a stable sense of home. There are multiple emotional beats rather than a single tone: a communal, joyful celebration; an intimate, identity-affirming exchange with Buddy; and Kira’s final internalization of what “home” means. Compared to the story so far, this passage is a clear shift away from dread/suspense and moral conflict toward acceptance, intimacy, and the fulfilled identity-shift that has been foreshadowed. There are no hard surprises here—the reconciliation and inclusive planning have been set up earlier—so the emotional payoff reads earned rather than shocking. Character-wise: Kira cements her transformation from stranded survivor to permanent community member (identity-shift/decision); Buddy reaches a quiet self-acceptance (vulnerability → strength); Florence moves from ostracized intermediary to an equal contributor (trust-built/relationship-shift); Holloway models a continued move from bureaucratic control to enabling leadership; others (Runner, Remedy, Velvet) shift from functional roles into collaborative partners who explicitly solicit Kira’s human perspective. The passage functions as gentle, communal catharsis and lasting closure rather than a dramatic twist.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="joy, intimacy">A spontaneous communal celebration—Scout bouncing, Runner's chambers humming, Velvet lighting the space, Remedy's 'celebration compounds'—creates an atmosphere of shared joy and domestic intimacy. Kira feels included, seen, and quietly proud as the facility becomes an artistic, lived-in home. The reader experiences relief and warmth: the long arc of trauma and mistrust is replaced by playful, sensory community life.</beat>
          <beat tags="vulnerability, relief">A private, tender exchange between Kira and Buddy: Buddy admits past fear of being 'the wrong AI' and realizes it has been enough by learning alongside Kira. Kira replies with gratitude. This beat resolves lingering insecurity (Buddy's and by extension Kira's) into acceptance. The reader feels intimate satisfaction—an emotional softening that humanizes the AI and completes its emotional arc.</beat>
          <beat tags="acceptance, hope">Kira's reflective, declarative moment—'Home isn't where you're from... It's where your voice matters'—is an inward cementing of identity and belonging. She accepts permanent membership and responsibility in the community. The reader experiences cathartic closure and hopeful forward motion as plans and invitations show that her voice will shape real futures.</beat>

          <development character="Buddy" tag="strength-discovered">Moves from anxious, apologetic helper to quietly self-assured partner—acknowledges past fear of not being 'good enough' and accepts that learning-with-Kira was the right role. This is a vulnerability-to-strength turn and emotional maturation for the AI.</development>
          <development character="Florence" tag="trust-built">Reintegrates fully as an equal contributor: she participates in celebration, thanks Kira for modeling belonging, and offers tactical/creative input without reverting to old deceptions. Her social standing is repaired in practice.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="relationship-shift">Continues the shift from procedural controller to enabling coordinator—publicly names Kira's value and coordinates future resource/leadership plans without commandeering. This represents a sustained relationship-shift in leadership style.</development>
          <development character="Runner" tag="relationship-shift">Explicitly invites Kira into technical/artistic collaboration (acoustic design), acknowledging the need for her human sensibility.

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage describes a post-crisis social moment that has ongoing significance: the community spontaneously celebrates, Remedy announces/uses a new class of scent compounds for joy, and Kira is explicitly included as an active, permanent collaborator on concrete future projects (acoustics, artistic growth, scent testing). These are not mere transitory details — they signal a durable shift from survival mode to creative, cooperative community-building with Kira as a continuing, influential member. I omitted transient details (time of day, Scout's specific bounces) and facts already established (Florence's reintegration, Kira's residency) unless the passage added a new, lasting element (e.g., Remedy's specific celebration compounds and concrete planned projects). No statements in this passage contradict previously established facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SPONTANEOUS_COMMUNITY_CELEBRATION">The plant collective and Kira spontaneously held an unplanned celebration that continued into the evening, marking a durable rise in morale and social cohesion.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CELEBRATION_COMPOUNDS_ANNOUNCED">Remedy developed and deployed new joy-inducing aromatic compounds ('celebration compounds' / 'happy perfume') and intends to continue experimenting with them.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_INCLUDED_AS_ACTIVE_DESIGN_PARTNER">Kira is explicitly being treated as an active, ongoing collaborator and design partner for community projects rather than a temporary guest; her human perspective will be solicited and integrated into future designs and experiments.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SPECIFIC_PROJECTS_PLANNED_WITH_KIRA">Concrete collaborative projects have been planned (or will begin soon) that include: Runner's new acoustic-chamber designs with Kira's input, Velvet's artistic growth plans for the western wing with Kira feedback, and Remedy's continued compound experiments with Kira as an olfactory tester.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_COMMUNITY_SHIFT_TO_SUSTAINED_CREATIVE_COOPERATION">The facility's social energy has moved from crisis-response to sustained creative cooperation and future-oriented planning (shared projects, aesthetic/functional building, and environmental enhancements).</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>This passage directly follows the previous one: the celebration erupts immediately after Torres and Dr. Chen depart. Time cues within the passage: immediate joyful activity, sensory details (scents, music, people gathering), and an explicit line that "The celebration continues into evening." Later: "The sun sets," bioluminescence provides light, people rest and plan for tomorrow — all indicating the scene moves from daytime into evening and ends that night. Thus the passage begins essentially where the previous left off (morning) and spans several hours, ending after sunset. Given the previous passage ended at ~07:30, a reasonable reading is that the passage starts at ~07:30 and continues through the day into early evening (roughly the late afternoon/evening hours). The passage therefore covers on the order of many hours (perhaps ~10–12 hours) of celebration, winding down into night with plans for the next day. This is all plausible: an unplanned celebration beginning in the morning and continuing into the evening fits the described activities (music, communal contributions, planning, exhaustion), and the transitions (sunset, resting, "tomorrow we'll start...") match the time span. There are no obvious timing contradictions given the earlier timestamp.</reasoning>
    <starts>~07:30</starts>
    <ends>~19:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The celebration begins right after Torres and Dr. Chen depart (the previous scene ended ~07:30), so no gap; the passage covers the ensuing hours of communal celebration and activities.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. An unplanned celebration that starts in the morning and lasts into the evening is reasonable given the described events (singing, scent diffusion, collaborative planning, fatigue). The cues ("continues into evening," "the sun sets," people resting and planning for tomorrow) support a multi-hour span. No implausible feats of work or travel are required in the time given.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Listed every character named in the passage as present. "Entered" lists characters who appear after the scene opens (they aren't introduced in the first lines): Florence wheels over later, Holloway is described as approaching the conversation after the scene begins, and Buddy doesn't speak until called mid-scene. No character explicitly leaves before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The only available entity that plausibly relates to the scene (the facility/setting) from the provided list is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so it is included as a relevant location.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage describes an unplanned communal celebration after Kira's decision to stay and shows deeper social integration: plants use their abilities to celebrate, Florence is fully reconciled and expresses gratitude, Holloway enables rather than commands, Buddy expresses enthusiastic approval, Scout provides social affection, and Kira is explicitly invited into and accepted as a permanent participant in future projects (acoustic designs, Velvet's western wing, Remedy's scent compounds, resource management and defensive planning). I will add bullets for the celebration, the community invitations and permanence of Kira's membership, and planned collaborative projects. I will keep earlier, still-relevant facts (crash, injuries, Harmony visit and refusal of extraction, SAM offline/Buddy active, plant roles, governance change) and avoid atmospheric detail.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural‑link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and social connector.
      - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ command node was neutralized and its root system removed to prevent contamination.
      - Facility sustained heavy structural and resource damage but core life‑support and medical systems remain functional; key plants are injured or regenerating.
      - Governance shifted after recovery: Holloway acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically within a committee‑driven, species‑aware reconstruction process.
      - Plants were repurposed for rebuilding tasks (acoustics/resonance, structural/artistic growth, environmental/chemical work, social curation and mediation).
      - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal; the community built a directional antenna integrating key plants and transmitted coordinates and Kira’s status; human freighter Harmony Prospect responded and landed.
      - Captain Torres and Dr. Chen came ashore to extract Kira; Kira refused extraction, publicly declared she would remain with the plant community, and signed an official declaration declining rescue; Harmony Prospect departed after leaving an emergency beacon and contact info.
      - Unplanned celebration followed Kira’s decision: plants and community members spontaneously contributed — Runner’s acoustic chambers, Velvet’s artistic growth, Remedy’s ‘celebration’ scent compounds, Holloway’s enabling coordination, and Scout’s exuberance.
      - Florence publicly reconciled with Kira, framing their choices as shared (belonging over obligation); she now participates fully as an equal and contributes defensive/tactical ideas valued by the group.
      - Kira was invited into ongoing and future projects as a permanent community member and contributor: she agreed to help with Runner’s acoustic designs, Velvet’s western wing plans, Remedy’s olfactory experiments, and broader collaborative reconstruction work.
      - Buddy expressed enthusiastic approval of Kira’s integration; the facility settled into a cooperative planning phase focused on joint projects, resource management, and mutual transformation.
      - Kira is now firmly accepted as part of the community, her human perspective explicitly valued alongside plant voices; the group plans continued collaborative rebuilding and defense preparations.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: Kira is basking in a sudden, unplanned celebration that functions as emotional confirmation: she is seen, wanted, and invited to stay. The scene is dominated by warm belonging (explicit acknowledgments, invitations to collaborate, Florence's reconciliation) and a relaxed, joyous relief that the long arc of mistrust and danger has culminated in real community. Reader: likely experiences cathartic warmth, satisfaction, and uplift — a payoff after sustained tension. There are multiple related beats (immediate celebration/joy; deep belonging/acceptance; reflective wonder/closure) but they form a single dominant, positive tone: communal healing and homecoming. Compared to the story so far, this passage is a culmination of recurring belonging/acceptance beats (it reuses that motif) but it feels like resolution rather than repetition — the pattern shifts from wary hope and fragile belonging to confident, settled membership and durable emotional payoff.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: A powerful sense of belonging and acceptance — Kira is repeatedly invited into planning and thanked for her voice; Florence is reintegrated; Holloway explicitly names Kira's value. This produces steady, settled acceptance (not tentative) that she is a permanent member, not a temporary guest. Reader: Feels warm validation and catharsis after the story's long arc of exile, betrayal, and repair; this beat functions as emotional resolution.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, hope">POV: Immediate celebratory joy and relieved release — Scout's bouncing, Runner's music, Remedy's scents and everyone contributing create exuberant, present-moment happiness and relief that the threat/rupture phase is over. The community's shared planning also seeds practical hope for the future. Reader: Experiences uplifted joy and a light, optimistic anticipation about collaborative projects and the group's durability.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, acceptance">POV: Reflective, almost reverent acceptance — Kira articulates the lesson ('Home is where your voice matters') and experiences quiet wonder at this strange, true family. It's contemplative closure: recognition of transformation and awe at how differences created richness. Reader: Feels resonant closure and emotional satisfaction; the scene reframes earlier procedural/fractured motifs into a humane, hopeful synthesis.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage is a payoff scene for social/integration threads (celebration, invitations to collaborate, Florence's reintegration, Buddy/Scout morale effects, Holloway coordinating future resource management) but it does not address earlier technical mysteries about the crash or external political consequences in detail. I treated explicit, concrete ongoing actions in the passage (Holloway coordinating resources; community acting locally; Florence participating as an equal; Buddy and Scout driving morale) as fulfilled payoffs for earlier promises that signaled those developments. I kept unresolved investigative/logistical promises about the crash, navigation, SAM, resource depletion, hostiles/regrouping, and the emergency beacon as still open because the passage either reinforced their relevance or left them untouched. Older, off-stage items that were introduced long ago and receive no reinforcement here (external guide/brightbloom mentions) I lapsed as the story has moved focus firmly to internal community life for now. Finally I recorded several new, concrete future-facing setups introduced in this passage (Runner/Velvet/Remedy project invitations, Holloway's resource-coordination plans, Florence's defensive suggestions, and an explicit statement of Kira's permanent integration), marking them tentative only when they were soft or exploratory in tone.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="AI_COMPANIONSHIP_WILL_AFFECT_MORALE">The previously noted influence of AI/companions on Kira’s morale is demonstrated and paid off here: Buddy and Scout visibly shape morale, interpretation, and celebration.</promise>
      <promise id="HOLLOWAY_IMPLEMENT_INVENTORY_TRACKING">Holloway's coordination/triage/inventory role was asserted earlier and is explicitly enacted here as Holloway coordinates future resource management and enables projects.</promise>
      <promise id="STOP_WAITING_FOR_ELDER_ACT_LOCALLY">The earlier setup that the community will act locally rather than defer to elders is realized: the community organizes, plans projects, and moves forward without waiting for outside authority.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_ARC">Florence's redemption/change arc (previously marked tentative) gets a clear payoff: she participates fully and is publicly integrated as an equal voice in the community.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="STREAMWALKER_BRIGHTBLOOM_INTRODUCED">An older off-stage contact (Streamwalker/Brightbloom) was introduced earlier but receives no reinforcement here; the story has shifted inward to community life, making this lead currently moot.</promise>
      <promise id="TERRITORY_THREE_GUIDES_INTRODUCED">Another older, external-guide worldbuilding item from much earlier is not referenced and has been de-prioritized by the passage’s focus on internal integration and future projects.</promise>

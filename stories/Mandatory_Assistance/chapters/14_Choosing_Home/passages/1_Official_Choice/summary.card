  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage resolves the immediate staging of Kira's decision (the freighter arrives and Kira declares she will stay) and sets up the next scene: the human representatives will inspect the facility before accepting her refusal. Fulfillments: the single, imminent promise that Kira would tell the freighter in person is paid off. Several earlier, high-level cultural and trust promises are reinforced by the freighter exchange (the community's inclusion norm, Kira's role, group trust), so those remain open. Older, speculative battlefield/hostility/resource promises introduced many passages ago received no reinforcement here and are safe to drop (they haven't been contradicted but the story has moved into the social/administrative consequences of Kira's choice). New, forward-driving promises are introduced by Torres and Dr. Chen's reactions: an on-site inspection/tour is explicitly requested (firm); the captain's skepticism and regulatory language foreshadow bureaucratic pushback or escalation (tentative); the medical officer's evaluation will likely be formally reported (tentative); and allowing humans into the facility creates an exposure/risk vector for the community (tentative). I carried forward promises that were recently reinforced or logically still relevant to community cohesion, repair work, and cultural change; I lapsed older, unresolved combat/resource threats that have not been reinforced for many passages and would clutter the immediate stakes.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="KIRA_WILL_TELL_FREIGHTER_IN_PERSON">Kira planned to meet the arriving freighter and tell them in person that she intended to remain with the plant community; in this passage she meets them and makes that declaration.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">Background threat of hostile plant aggression/perimeter behavior was never referenced during the freighter sequence; the narrative focus moved to Kira's social/administrative choice, so this old background threat is not currently relevant.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBILITY_OF_POST_ATTACK_REPENTANCE_OR_RESENTMENT">Long-term dynamics of resentments/repentance weren't engaged here; the scene reinforces goodwill and reconciliation instead, so this older, speculative promise lapses for now.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTIVE_TACTICS">The enemy's adaptive tactical options (decentralization/shifts) are not part of this social confrontation and haven't been reinforced recently, so this older tactical possibility is dropped from immediate relevance.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_SHORTAGE_THREAT">General resource shortages introduced many passages back receive no reinforcement here; operational/repair threads that remain are better captured by more recent resource/repair promises, so this older, tentative resource threat is lapsed.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_EXTENDED_SIEGE_EXPECTED">No sign of an extended siege or renewed campaign in this passage; the story is focused on the freighter and social choices, so that older tactical expectation is no longer active in the immediate plot.</promise>
      <promise id="VELVET_PERIMETER_FAILURE_RISK">Velvet's perimeter-risk note was an earlier operational concern; the freighter scene does not engage it and the risk has not been reinforced recently, so it lapses for now.</promise>
      <promise id="ENEMY_DECOUPLED_ADAPTATION">The possibility the enemy will decentralize after the command node's loss isn't referenced here and remains an older speculative threat; it's dropped from immediate consideration.</promise>
      <promise id="POST_BATTLE_RESOURCE_CRISIS">An older, broadly framed post-battle resource crisis is not invoked in the freighter scene; more recent, specific repair/resource promises cover near-term needs, so this broad promise is lapsed.</promise>
    </lapsed>
    <open>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_WITHDRAW_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="33">Florence previously indicated conditional withdrawal if rejected; she is supportive now but the behavioral risk remains a potential vulnerability if future rejection or conflict occurs.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_EXHAUSTION_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="34">Florence has contributed heavily and may still face exhaustion or reduced capacity for sustained participation; she is supportive here but long-term fatigue remains a plausible risk.</promise>
      <promise id="STRUCTURAL_DAMAGE_REPAIR_NEEDS" tentative="true" introduced="34">Ongoing repair work and phased reconstruction remain active operational needs for the facility; the freighter visit doesn't remove these requirements.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_TRUST_SOLIDIFICATION" tentative="true" introduced="36">Trust among group members has been strengthened; the community's visible support for Kira and Holloway's defense reinforce this promise that trust solidification is progressing but not guaranteed forever.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_TRUST_BUILDING_REQUIRED" tentative="true" introduced="37">Trust and forgiveness are framed as long-term processes; current goodwill (including during the freighter visit) is strong but more work is needed to cement durable trust.</promise>
      <promise id="STRUCTURAL_REPAIR_AND_RESOURCE_DRIVE" tentative="false" introduced="37">Ongoing rebuilding and resource-acquisition remain necessary operational tasks for the community; these needs are still outstanding and will compete with other priorities.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_INCLUSION_AS_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="37">Inclusion of outsiders (Florence) and integration of Kira are actively practiced and reinforced; Holloway's and others' behavior here supports carrying this forward as an emergent norm, though its permanence is not guaranteed.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOUT_BRIDGE_ROLE" tentative="true" introduced="37">Scout continues to function as an emotional/social bridge and support for Kira; Scout's presence during the freighter arrival reinforces the importance of this role.</promise>
      <promise id="WESTERN_WING_DESIGN_PROJECT" tentative="false" introduced="38">Planned western wing project and related near-term design/repair tasks remain outstanding and will test collaborative decision-making and resource allocation.</promise>
      <promise id="CULTURAL_RENOVATION_AND_AESTHETIC_INTEGRATION" tentative="false" introduced="38">The facility's cultural and aesthetic shift toward human-friendly design continues to shape daily life and will require sustained work and buy-in.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_ROLE_IN_DESIGN_AND_DECISIONS" tentative="false" introduced="38">Kira's role in shaping facility choices and design was reinforced in the previous passage and remains consequential; her continuing involvement is an ongoing plot element.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_SOLIDIFICATION_AS_HARMONY_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="38">The emergent co-creative pattern of mutual respect and integrated design is reinforced by recent events (including this public demonstration of support) but whether it stabilizes permanently remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_CHANGES_PERSIST" tentative="true" introduced="40">Several members assert that Kira's influence reshaped practices and priorities; the freighter visit (and Holloway's defense) supports short-term persistence, but long-term cultural permanence is still open.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_RESPONSE_TO_KIRA_DECISION" tentative="true" introduced="40">How the freighter, the company, and broader human institutions will react to Kira's formal refusal (bureaucratic, legal, or reputational consequences) remains unresolved and may have future narrative impact.</promise>
      <promise id="FREIGHTER_WILL_TOUR_FACILITY" tentative="false" introduced="41">Captain Torres agreed to inspect the facility and talk to community members before concluding whether Kira's refusal is genuine — an explicit, immediate next action that will determine how the freighter responds.</promise>
      <promise id="TORRES_MAY_CHALLENGE_DECISION_OR_FORCE_EXTRACTION" tentative="true" introduced="41">Torres' invocation of regulations and skepticism about appropriateness the scene foreshadows possible bureaucratic pushback, escalation, or pressure to extract Kira despite her declared choice.</promise>
      <promise id="DR_CHEN_WILL_REPORT_FINDINGS" tentative="true" introduced="41">Dr. Chen's medical scan already produced favorable readings; it's likely she'll formally document or report those findings to company authorities, which could influence official decisions.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="41">Allowing human officials to tour the facility exposes the plant community to evaluation and potential misunderstanding or bureaucratic consequences; this public exposure is a new risk vector for the group.</promise>

  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>I selected only details that introduce new, durable elements likely to matter later (named human rescuers, an external medical evaluation, and the freighter crew's intent to inspect the facility). I omitted transient scene description and facts already present in the established record (e.g., that the Harmony Prospect replied/was coming and that Kira planned to refuse extraction). No information in the passage contradicts prior facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_CAPTAIN_TORRES_INTRODUCED">A human named Captain Torres is the captain of the arriving freighter Harmony Prospect and personally came to extract Kira.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DR_CHEN_INTRODUCED">A medical officer named Dr. Chen accompanied the freighter crew and interacted with Kira.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DR_CHEN_PERFORMED_MEDICAL_SCAN">Dr. Chen scanned Kira on-site (medical/neural scan) and reported vitals normal, no foreign substances detected, and neural patterns indicating Kira is healthier than her baseline.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_EXTERNAL_MEDICAL_EVALUATION_CONFIRMS_WELLNESS">An independent human medical evaluation (Dr. Chen) corroborates Buddy's assessment that Kira's physiological and psychological indicators are improved relative to baseline.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FREIGHTER_CREW_WILL_INSPECT_FACILITY">Captain Torres (after Kira's invitation) agreed to tour and speak with the community to determine whether Kira's choice appears voluntary or coerced.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage opens with the freighter arriving "just after dawn," and the previous passage closed with the narrator saying "Tomorrow the freighter arrives" and going to sleep. The authoritative end time for the previous passage is 2687-05-15T20:00, so the freighter arrival is the next morning. The events in this passage (landing, initial exchange with Captain Torres, a quick medical scan by Dr. Chen, some short argument about voluntary refusal, Holloway's appearance, and Torres agreeing to a tour) all take place during that morning visit. Overall the passage covers a short interval — the landing and immediate on-site interactions — not more than an hour or two. Using the previous end time as reference, the gap is an overnight period during which the protagonist sleeps and the community gathers for the arrival. Small internal POV confusions in the previous passage (the narrator miscounting days) are narrative voice, not a chronological contradiction with the freighter arriving the next morning. The timeline (overnight gap and a morning exchange of the length shown) is plausible: the freighter could arrive at dawn, perform a quick on-site evaluation, and then accept a request to tour the facility within an hour or so.</reasoning>
    <starts>~2687-05-16T06:00</starts>
    <ends>~2687-05-16T07:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>Approximately 10 hours (previous ended 2687-05-15T20:00; this begins just after dawn the next day). Likely activities during the gap: sleep, final preparations, community assembling to witness the freighter's arrival, and the protagonist mentally preparing to make the decision.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The overnight gap fits the narrator's 'tomorrow the freighter arrives' line and their going to sleep. The actions shown (landing, short conversation, a rapid noninvasive medical scan, Holloway's approach, and the captain agreeing to a tour) can reasonably occur within an hour or two after a dawn landing. Minor narrative confusion about day counts in the prior passage is a POV remark rather than a timing error and doesn't create an implausible gap.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I identified characters by explicit name mentions in the passage and cross-checked them against the provided available character list. Kira Voss is the narrator and clearly present. Scout is explicitly present at the start (“standing outside the facility with Scout”). Buddy is mentioned as speaking quietly in Kira's mind, so he counts as present/mentioned. Holloway is explicitly named later as approaching and speaking to Captain Torres. Captain Torres and Dr. Chen are named in the passage but are not in the provided available-characters list, so they cannot be referenced by card path and are therefore omitted from the character arrays. The passage also references the show Uncharted (Mav/Maverick), which matches the available entity /world/entities/Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone.card. No available-list characters enter the scene who were not already present at the previous passage end, and no available-list characters exit before the scene ends, so ENTERED and EXITED are empty.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The new passage adds the freighter's actual arrival and Kira's in-person confrontation with the extraction team. Important plot beats to add: Harmony Prospect lands; Captain Torres and Dr. Chen disembark; Kira formally refuses extraction on grounds of free choice and belonging; Dr. Chen's medical scan confirms Kira is neurologically healthy with elevated well‑being; Torres is skeptical but accepts Kira's offer to tour the facility and speak with the community to verify voluntariness; Holloway affirms Kira's autonomy. I consolidated earlier detailed bullets about each community member's incremental contributions into a single concise bullet about the community's reconstruction and emergent roles, since those specific project-level details are less critical going forward than the fact of cooperative recovery and social integration. I kept prior key events (crash, hostile root node, destruction, contact with freighter, Kira's decision to stay) and updated them with the new, immediate confrontation and resolution steps.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Mining shuttle crashed during approach; Kira Voss survived with AI Buddy and companion Scout; SAM remains offline.
      - Hull breach revealed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; survivors sheltered with local plants and used the shuttle as shelter.
      - Hostile plants coordinated assaults from an underground root command node; defenders located and forced the node to surface, extracted and destroyed the root mass, collapsing hostile coordination.
      - Victory cost heavy damage and supplies; survivors were injured but survived; Florence reintegrated from isolation and the group shifted from survival to cooperative recovery over subsequent weeks.
      - The community rebuilt the facility as a shared human–plant habitat; members assumed practical and social roles (tunnels, living structures, environmental chemistry, defenses, coordination, emotional support) and Buddy/Scout observed high social integration.
      - Buddy detected an artificial signal; the community constructed a plant‑based uplink and Buddy contacted the commercial freighter Harmony Prospect, which acknowledged one survivor and planned extraction in ~48 hours.
      - Kira wrestled with leaving, held extended conversations with community members, and decided to remain; she planned to tell the arriving freighter in person.
      - The freighter Harmony Prospect arrived at dawn; Captain Torres and medical officer Dr. Chen disembarked to extract Kira.
      - Kira informed Torres she was choosing to stay. Dr. Chen scanned her and reported normal vitals and elevated well‑being; she is neurologically sound and not coerced.
      - Torres was skeptical but agreed to let Kira tour the facility and meet the community to verify that her refusal is voluntary; Holloway publicly affirmed Kira's autonomy and valued community membership.
    </summary>

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV (Kira) feeling and why: Kira is calm, resolute, and quietly confident. She has already made the decision to stay and the immediate task is honesty and boundary-setting rather than theatrical persuasion; her calmness is bolstered by Buddy’s private encouragement and by the visible presence of the community. The emotion comes from hard-won belonging and the finality of claiming it publicly. Reader experience: the reader feels a mix of tension and relief — tension because authority (the freighter’s medical officer and captain) initially frames Kira’s choice as suspect, relief and uplift when objective data and Holloway’s defense validate her claim. Multiple beats or dominant tone: there are multiple beats: a steady declaration of choice (determination/acceptance), a skeptical interrogation (conflict/suspense), and a validating resolution (relief/hope). Comparison to pattern so far: this passage is a tidy emotional payoff to earlier arcs (Kira’s growing belonging, her private decision to stay). Throughout the story Kira has moved from isolated survivor through trust-building to integration; here she publicly converts that private identity-shift into an explicit legal/social choice under scrutiny. Surprises for the reader: few and small — the most concrete surprise is the objective medical scan showing Kira healthier than baseline, which reverses the expected script that a stranded human would be impaired. Holloway’s clear, diplomatic defense is not surprising in character terms but functions as a surprising reinforcement of plant advocacy in a formal human/nonhuman interaction. Character changes/reveals: Kira formalizes and externalizes a prior internal decision (a deliberate leadership/identity move); Holloway formally asserts the collective’s ethical stance about agency (relationship-shift/trust-building); Torres is forced to briefly question standard protocol and accept a site tour (a small belief-challenged moment). Overall emotional aim: quiet, earned closure rather than performative drama — the scene converts internal belonging into an incontrovertible social fact by inviting external verification rather than winning by rhetoric.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="determination, acceptance">Kira's calm, certain declaration that she will remain. Emotion arises from her internal conviction and sense of belonging; the POV is steady and unperformative (no melodrama). The reader experiences closure and moral weight — this is the crux of her arc made explicit.</beat>
      <beat tags="conflict, suspense">Immediate institutional skepticism from Dr. Chen and Captain Torres — accusations of coercion or psychological impairment create procedural conflict. The POV meets interrogation with composure; the reader feels tension as protocol confronts an unconventional choice with possible coercive interpretation.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, hope">Objective validation (medical scan showing improved/healthy markers) and Holloway's public defense shift the tone to relief and hopeful legitimacy. The community's presence and Torres' willingness to tour the facility convert private belonging into defensible social reality; the reader is reassured and feels uplifted by tangible confirmation.</beat>
    </beats>
    <surprises>
      <surprise tags="reversal, plot">The freighter's medical scan reads better-than-baseline wellbeing. The expected plot beat — a stranded human showing impairment or coercion — is reversed: objective data supports Kira's flourishing in the community, undermining the rescue team's default assumption that attachment must be pathological.</surprise>
      <surprise tags="character, reversal">Captain Torres, faced with Kira's calm refusal and Holloway's advocacy, doesn't insist on immediate extraction; instead he accepts a tour as evidence. It's a small reversal of the likely rigid 'protocol-first' posture and signals willingness to reconsider rather than force compliance.</surprise>
    </surprises>
    <character-development>
      <development character="Kira Voss" tag="decision">Converts a private choice into a public, legally framed decision—asserts agency under scrutiny rather than retreating to melodrama. This externalizes and cements her identity-shift into a community member who can refuse rescue on informed grounds.</development>
      <development character="Holloway" tag="relationship-shift">Steps into a formal advocate role, defending Kira's agency to human authorities and reframing the plant collective as a polity that honors individual voice. This is a visible relationship-shift from procedural coordinator to active protector and diplomatic interlocutor.</development>
      <development character="Captain Torres" tag="belief-challenged">Faced with concrete evidence and a persuasive invitation, he temporarily suspends strict protocol and agrees to inspect the facility before enforcing extraction—a small challenge to his prior procedural certainty.</development>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>The previous passage ends the night before the freighter's scheduled arrival; the current passage opens with the freighter appearing "just after dawn." That places the start on the morning immediately following the previous passage. The scene covers the landing, an initial exchange with Captain Torres and Dr. Chen, and a quick medical scan and negotiation to tour the facility — events that plausibly unfold over minutes to an hour. The passage ends when Torres agrees to be shown the facility. The gap from the previous passage is essentially overnight (hours, not days). Timing is plausible for narrative flow; the only minor realism caveat is the speed and conclusiveness of the medical scan, which in real life might take longer or require more analysis, but is acceptable within typical story compression.</reasoning>
    <starts>dawn (~06:20)</starts>
    <ends>morning (~07:00)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>Overnight — roughly 8–12 hours between the end of the previous passage (the evening/night before the freighter arrives) and this passage's start. During that gap the narrator sleeps/reflects and the freighter approaches on schedule.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The overnight gap fits the prior scene (the narrator intended to tell the freighter the next day). The freighter arriving just after dawn and the community gathering are believable. The landing, greeting, short conversation and an on-the-spot scan can reasonably occur within 10–40 minutes in fiction; the only slight timing stretch is how immediately conclusive the medical scan appears, but that is a minor narrative compression rather than a serious inconsistency.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I read the passage and noted named characters who appear. Kira Voss is the narrator ('I'). Scout is explicitly present at the start watching the freighter. Captain Torres and Dr. Chen are named in the passage but are not among the provided character cards, so they cannot be listed as card paths. Holloway is named later as approaching the group (she arrives during the interaction), so she counts as entering during the scene. No character from the provided list is described as leaving before the end of the passage, so the EXITED list is empty. The scene takes place at the facility on the planet; the only provided entity that matches is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage reports the arriving freighter (Harmony Prospect) landing and its crew (Captain Torres and Dr. Chen) coming to extract Kira. Kira publicly refuses extraction, stating she chooses to remain with the plant community. Dr. Chen medically scans Kira and finds normal vitals, no foreign substances, and neural patterns indicating Kira is healthier than baseline. Captain Torres is skeptical and cites regulations; Holloway affirms Kira's autonomy and community status and invites Torres to inspect the facility. Torres agrees to tour to verify voluntariness. I removed the now-fulfilled bullet about the freighter being 'due to arrive' and replaced it with the landing and refusal events, and consolidated related details about the extraction attempt and verification steps.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural‑link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and stayed close to her.
      - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ coordination and a massive command node were neutralized; Runner and Remedy removed the node’s root system to prevent contamination.
      - Facility sustained heavy structural and resource damage; core life‑support and medical systems remain functional; key plants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) are injured or regenerating.
      - Governance shifted after recovery: Holloway acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically without dominating decisions.
      - Reconstruction is committee‑driven and species‑aware; plants were repurposed for rebuilding roles (resonance/amplification, structural growth, environmental/chemical work, social curation).
      - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal; the community built a directional antenna integrating Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Florence and Holloway and transmitted coordinates and Kira’s status.
      - Human commercial freighter Harmony Prospect acknowledged the signal and has arrived and landed.
      - Captain Torres and medical officer Dr. Chen came ashore to extract Kira.
      - Kira publicly refused extraction, declaring she is choosing to remain with the plant community; the community (and Scout) were present and supportive.
      - Dr. Chen scanned Kira: vitals normal, no foreign substances, neural patterns indicate Kira is healthier than baseline and psychologically well‑integrated.
      - Torres expressed regulatory concern and skepticism; Holloway affirmed Kira’s autonomy and value and invited Torres to tour the facility to judge for himself.
      - Torres agreed to tour the facility to verify that Kira’s decision is voluntary.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings: The passage centers on a calm, resolute pride. Kira experiences acute anticipation as the freighter arrives, then steadies into certainty and conviction when offered extraction — she deliberately claims belonging and declines rescue. Her feelings oscillate from nervous excitement (Scout mirrors this) to serene firmness and then to vindicated relief as the medical scan and Holloway's testimony confirm her capacity and agency. The immediate interpersonal beats (Torres's protocolling, Dr. Chen's suspicion) provoke mild friction, but Kira remains emotionally centered and unshaken.

      Reader experience: The reader shares the initial lift of anticipation and suspense (the long-awaited rescue finally appears). That spike is quickly reframed into a poignant, slightly unexpected emotional turn when Kira refuses rescue — generating surprise, warmth, and admiration. The encounter with Torres and Dr. Chen adds a note of tension and procedural skepticism, but the medical validation and Holloway's defense produce a satisfying emotional payoff: relief and moral vindication for Kira's choice. Overall the reader moves from eager suspense to a bittersweet, affirming closure.

      Multiple beats or one tone: There are three clear emotional beats here rather than a single monolithic tone: (1) anticipatory uplift at arrival, (2) defiant belonging when Kira refuses rescue and negotiates with skeptical humans, and (3) validation/relief as scans and testimony confirm her decision. The passage balances tension (human skepticism) with warmth (community presence and Kira’s conviction), ending on a quietly victorious, accepting note.

      Comparison to prior pattern: This continues the story's recurring anticipation → tension → acceptance arc but with a meaningful evolution. Earlier scenes built toward external rescue and repeatedly framed hope as something uncertain or costly; here the rescue moment becomes the occasion for resolved agency and belonging rather than passive relief. The emotional repetition (anticipation followed by institutional friction) is present, but the payoff differs: instead of procedural delay or bitter disappointment, Kira achieves authentic belonging and self-determination. This passage functions as an emotional culmination — it reframes earlier anxieties about rescue into a clear, earned choice and reduces the story's prior cycles of helplessness by giving Kira the final, decisive voice.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, tension">POV: Sharp, eager anticipation as the freighter descends — Kira is calm but inwardly charged ('big moment'), supported by the communal presence (Scout bouncing). Cause: the long-awaited human contact and potential extraction arriving at last. Reader: feels suspenseful uplift and curiosity about what the freighter will mean for Kira and the plant-community; underlying tension because this moment could resolve or destabilize everything.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, frustration">POV: Quiet, resolute belonging and moral defiance when Kira refuses extraction — she frames the plants as a community that values her contribution and asserts agency against protocol. Cause: Torres’ protocols and Dr. Chen’s immediate suspicion prompt friction; Kira's calm rebuttal converts potential coercion into a stand for identity. Reader: experiences surprise and warmth at Kira’s decision, mixed with frustration/tension as the human officers doubt her motives and attempt to medicalize her choice.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, acceptance">POV: Vindicated relief and steady acceptance when medical scans confirm Kira is healthy and Holloway defends her agency — Kira feels validated in calling the facility home. Cause: Dr. Chen’s scan readings and Holloway’s testimony remove the claim of impairment/coercion and allow the standoff to move toward mutual appraisal rather than forced extraction. Reader: feels cathartic relief and emotional closure — the long arc toward belonging is affirmed, converting earlier anxiety about rescue into a satisfying, accepting resolution.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      Summary of analysis:

      This passage stages the freighter's arrival and Kira's explicit, in-person refusal of extraction. That action resolves the immediate, concrete setup about informing the freighter in person and provokes the expected initial human reaction (medical scan, skepticism, invocation of protocol) — so those earlier promises are paid off here. The freighter crew asking for a tour introduces a firm new setup (they will inspect the facility), and the captain's invocation of regulations raises a new tentative promise that company/legal/bureaucratic consequences may follow. Most earlier mysteries (crash diagnostics, SAM, atmospheric entry, navigation failure) and ongoing logistical / political / ecological threads remain open; nothing in this passage contradicts or makes them moot. I therefore mark the two very immediate promises as fulfilled, add two new forward-moving promises, carry forward the remaining open promises from the list, and do not mark any large, older promise as lapsed (none were explicitly dropped or made irrelevant).

      Notes on borderline items:
      - HUMAN_VESSEL_REACTION_TO_REFUSAL was tentative previously; this passage shows the human crew reacting (scan, skepticism, decision to inspect), which constitutes the promised reaction being realized — so I mark it fulfilled (still tentative in spirit). 
      - INFORM_FREIGHTER_IN_PERSON is an explicit, near-term action and is clearly fulfilled in this passage. 
      - EXTERNAL_CONTACT_POLITICAL_CONSEQUENCES remains open and becomes more salient now that a human vessel has inspected and is likely to report. 
      - I kept LAPSED_PROMISES empty because nothing was directly contradicted or abandoned; the story moved forward on the immediate courier/boarding interaction but left strategic and mystery threads intact.

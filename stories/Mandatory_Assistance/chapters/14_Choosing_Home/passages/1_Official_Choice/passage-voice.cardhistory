            The freighter appears in the sky just after dawn.

            I stand outside the facility with Scout, watching it descend. The whole community is gatherednot crowding, justpresent, supporting me, whatever happens.

            Scout bouncesnervous, exciteda big moment bounce.

            I say, "Big moment."

            The commercial freighter Harmony Prospect lands smoothlya professional operation. Two figures emerge: Captain Torres and a woman who looks like a medical officer.

            I walk forward to meet themcalm, certain.

            I say, "Captain Torres. Thank you for coming."

            Torres is tall, efficient-looking, clearly used to command. He says, "Kira Voss? Survivor of courier vessel crash?"

            I answer, "That's me."

            He says, "We're here to extract you and return you to human civilization. Are you ready to depart?"

            Here it isthe moment.

            ¶

            I say clearly, "Thank you for comingbut I'm choosing to stay here. This is my home."

            Torres blinks. He says, "I'm sorry, what?"

            I say, "I'm choosing to remain with this community. I'm not being held. This is my free decision."

            The medical officerDr. Chen, according to her badgesteps forward immediately. She says, "We need to evaluate you. After weeks stranded, there could be psychological effects, Stockholm syndrome, alien influence"

            I say, "You're welcome to scan me. I'm neurologically sound, fully lucid, and making this choice freely."

            Dr. Chen pulls out a medical scanner and runs it over me. She frowns at the readings and says, "Vitals normal. No foreign substances. Neural patterns indicateyou're actually healthier than baseline."

            I say, "I told you."

            Torres is processing this. He says, "Ms. Voss, you've been stranded with alien life forms for weeks. It's natural to form attachment to your rescuers, but"

            I say, "They're not my rescuers. They're my community."

            He says, "They're plants."

            I say, "They're people who value my individual contributionwhich is more than I can say for the human bureaucracy that sent me on that courier mission."

            Torres looks past me at the facilitythe weird, wonderful plant construction, the artistic growth, the absurd but functional design. He says, "This isn't an appropriate environment for a human."

            I keep my voice calm, rational. I say, "It's more appropriate than any environment I've lived in. Captain, I understand this is irregular. But I'm a legal adult, sound mind, making an informed choiceI'm choosing to stay."

            He begins, "We have regulations"

            I finish, "About rescue refusal? Yes. I'm refusing rescue. Not because I'm impaired or coerced. Because I found something rare: authentic belonging."

            Dr. Chen continues scanning. She says, "Her well-being indicators are significantly elevated. Stress levels below norm, social integration metrics high, psychological markers all positive."

            I say simply, "That's because I'm happy here."

            Torres struggles with this. He says, "The company sent us to extract a human survivor. Standard protocol"

            I finish, "Doesn't cover this situation. I know. But I'm still choosing to stay."

            Overall tone &amp; pacing: Calm, measured narration with a few strong, decisive beats—keep the pacing steady, allow the dramatic pause at the refusal to breathe and register the reactions.

            - Read the opening lines with a soft, observant tone: "The freighter appears in the sky just after dawn."
            - For "Scout bounces—nervous, excited—a big moment bounce." make the voice slightly lighter and quicker on "bounces," then return to steady narration.
            - Put distinct emphasis on speaker tags before quotes, e.g. read "I say, \"Big moment.\"" as a single beat, confident but not loud.
            - At the paragraph containing only "¶", take a long silence (dramatic pause) before continuing into the refusal.
            - Deliver the refusal line "I say clearly, \"Thank you for coming—but I'm choosing to stay here. This is my home.\"" with calm conviction; let the em dash register as a measured shift in thought.
            - When Torres and Dr. Chen react, let their lines carry mild incredulity or professional concern respectively—Torres slightly incredulous, Dr. Chen brisk and clinical.
            - End lines like "That's because I'm happy here." and "But I'm still choosing to stay." with quiet, resolute emphasis.

            Holloway approaches carefully and says, "Captain Torres, I'm the facility coordinator. Kira is a valued community member. She's free to leave anytime she chooses. We would *never* hold her against her will."

            Torres examines Holloway with obvious skepticism and says, "You're… a plant."

            Holloway replies, "I'm a sentient being who values individual voices contributing to collective harmony. Kira's voice matters here."

            Torres says, "This is highly irregular."

            I say, "Belonging usually is."

            Torres turns back to me and says, "Ms. Voss, I need to be absolutely certain this is your genuine choice and not coercion or impairment. What would convince me?"

            I say, "Let me show you—tour the facility, talk to everyone, see what we've built together—then decide if this looks like captivity or community."

            Torres exchanges looks with Dr. Chen, then nods. Torres says, "Show me."

            Overall tone &amp; pacing: Calm, measured, quietly persuasive with a skeptical edge—keep pacing steady and allow brief pauses for the small, revealing beats.

            - Read "Holloway approaches carefully and says, \"Captain Torres...\"" with a calm, reassuring tone; emphasize the word "*never*" as a stronger, firmer beat.
            - For "Torres examines Holloway..." adopt a clipped, skeptical delivery; make the ellipsis in "You're… a plant." a short, surprised hesitation.
            - Read "Holloway replies, \"I'm a sentient being...\"" gentle and earnest—dignified conviction rather than defensiveness.
            - Deliver "Torres says, \"This is highly irregular.\"" crisp and professional, mild incredulity.
            - For "I say, \"Belonging usually is.\"" use a quiet, wry confidence—a small, knowing pause before the line.
            - Read the invitation "I say, \"Let me show you—tour the facility...\"" as patient and guiding; treat each em dash as a short directing pause.
            - For the final beats, "Torres exchanges looks... then nods." pause slightly, then deliver "Torres says, \"Show me.\"" with restrained acceptance and a firm terminal fall; decisive stop.

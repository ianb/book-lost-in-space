      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>The passage ends immediately after the freighter lands and Kira meets the crew, so the objective physical facts are recent: the Harmony Prospect is on the ground near the plant facility; two human crew (Captain Torres and Dr. Chen) have disembarked and are standing outside; Dr. Chen has used a handheld medical scanner on Kira and obtained normal/healthy readings. Kira is standing outside the facility with Scout (who is bouncing nearby); the plant community is physically present around the facility but giving space. Holloway has approached and is standing near Kira and the humans. The plant-built facility and its enhancements (Velvet’s seating and translucent growth panels, Remedy’s scent/air enhancements, Holloway’s bioluminescence, Runner’s amplification network and underground work, the operational roof antenna) remain active and intact, producing harmonics, light, and scent. The original human communications hardware remains damaged but the plant antenna/amplifier and the freighter’s presence provide contact. Dawn light; the freighter landed smoothly; no damage to people or structures is described. Captain Torres agrees to tour the facility to verify Kira’s claim, so movement toward an escorted inspection is imminent. Buddy (the AI assistant) was previously online and remains available to support Kira unless otherwise noted.</reasoning>
        <state>Just after dawn the commercial freighter Harmony Prospect is landed nearby. Two human crew—Captain Torres and Dr. Chen—stand outside the plant facility; Dr. Chen has a medical scanner and has just scanned Kira, finding normal vitals and healthy neural readings. Kira stands outside with Scout (bouncing nervously/excitedly). The plant community members are physically gathered around the facility, present but not crowding; Holloway is beside Kira and will escort/introduce the visitors. The plant-built facility is intact and fully functional: Velvet’s seating and translucent growth panels, Remedy’s scent/environmental enhancements, Holloway’s bioluminescent lighting, Runner’s underground resonance/amplification network humming, and the roof antenna/amplifier are all active. The original human communications hardware remains damaged but plant antenna and the freighter provide contact. The freighter crew have agreed to tour the facility, making an inspection and face-to-face conversations imminent.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>The passage stages the freighter's arrival and Kira's in-person refusal of extraction. That action resolves one concrete near-term beat from the prior list (KIRA_WILL_TELL_FREIGHTER_IN_PERSON). Most strategic, governance, and resource promises from the previous passage remain active: arrival simply moves the conflict from abstract to immediate but does not resolve the political, institutional, or logistical questions. The freighter's medical check and the captain's decision to tour the facility create new, testable promises (the tour, medical evidence shaping official response, publicity/reporting consequences, and the risk of enforcement/escalation). I found no previous open promises that were clearly abandoned or rendered moot by this passage — they remain relevant and in play.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="KIRA_WILL_TELL_FREIGHTER_IN_PERSON">Kira directly informed the arriving freighter that she is refusing extraction and choosing to remain with the plant community; the promised on‑site declaration occurred and was resolved in this passage.</promise>

          <promise id="REMEDY_CONCENTRATED_DEPLOYMENT_RECOVERY">Sustainability and resupply issues around Remedy's enhancements remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">Long‑term habitability and structural robustness still need planning and resources.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_ADAPTATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_LOSS">Risk that hostiles adapt tactically after command node loss remains an active strategic concern.</promise>

          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_OUTSIDE_PERIMETER_RISK">Risks associated with externalized enemy hardware and retrieval remain unaddressed.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_ANALYSIS_OPPORTUNITY">The extracted command node still offers intelligence opportunities requiring protocols and resources to exploit.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_REPAIR_TIMELINE_AND_RESOURCE_REQUEST">Velvet's rebuilding timeline and external sourcing needs are still outstanding.</promise>
          <promise id="MULTIFUNCTIONAL_INFRASTRUCTURE">Runner's repurposed systems have multi‑use utility; longer‑term tactical, cultural, and security consequences remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS">Remedy's shift to comfort and scents raises sustainability and prioritization questions that are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_HUMAN_ERGONOMICS_INTEGRATION">Velvet's integration of human ergonomics into growth projects suggests future resource and design tradeoffs that need formalization.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_GOVERNANCE_INSTITUTIONALIZATION">Daily collaborative norms are practiced; whether these become formal governance, crediting, exile/forgiveness procedures, or face pushback remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBLE_LEAVING_CONFLICT">Although Kira refused extraction, the political/policy consequences of her refusal and how the freighter/human authorities will respond remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_TECH_COMMUNICATIONS_CAPABILITY">Demonstrated communications capability is now politically salient given the freighter arrival; future usage and exposure implications remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_ARRIVAL_IMPACT">The freighter's arrival has happened physically but its broader impacts on publicity, human intervention, authority claims, and resource flows are still unfolding.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_EVOLUTION_FROM_SOCIAL_CHANGE">Kira's choice will prompt role and leadership evolution; the process and tensions are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_PERSONAL_IDENTITY_ARC">Kira's choice anchors an arc about belonging vs. origin; the future consequences of that choice will be followed.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_RESPONSE_AND_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE">How the freighter/company will report and respond publicly and institutionally to Kira's refusal is now an immediate, unresolved plot thread.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP_FORMALIZATION">With Kira staying, the community will face pressure to formalize membership, rights, and conflict‑resolution procedures; still open.</promise>
          <promise id="CULTURAL_SHIFT_TOWARD_INDIVIDUAL_VALUATION">The shift toward valuing individual voices (including non‑plants) is catalyzed but its durability and limits are untested.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_LONG_TERM_ATTACHMENT">Scout's deep bond remains a salient emotional factor and potential flashpoint if outside actors intervene.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_REHABILITATION_ARC">Florence's social rehabilitation continues to develop; institutional rehabilitation or lingering consequences remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_INSPECTION_TOUR_OUTCOME">Captain Torres agreed to tour the facility to judge whether Kira's choice is voluntary; the tour's outcome will determine whether the freighter accepts her refusal or escalates.</promise>
          <promise id="MEDICAL_EVALUATION_IMPACT_ON_AUTHORITY_DECISION">Dr. Chen's scan already indicates Kira is healthy; how that medical assessment will be documented and used to validate consent or inform company policy is now a live promise.</promise>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_REPORTING_AND_PUBLICITY">The freighter must decide how to report this incident to company and authorities; that reporting could create wider publicity, political pressure, or legal consequences for the community.</promise>
          <promise id="POTENTIAL_ENFORCEMENT_OR_ESCALATION">There remains a risk the company or human authorities will attempt coercive/legal measures if they decide the refusal is unacceptable—this enforcement possibility is now an immediate open threat.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_AUTHORITIES_VISIBILITY">The captain's tour and any subsequent report could bring regulatory or law‑enforcement attention to the plant community, with attendant risks and opportunities.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>The passage largely enacts previously established plans (the freighter arrives; Kira intends to refuse extraction; staff will tour the facility). Significant incremental details that matter later: a human medical officer (Dr. Chen) explicitly reports no foreign substances and finds Kira's physiological/neural metrics improved compared to baseline (stress below norm, social-integration metrics high), which is independent confirmation of the plants' and Buddy's assessments and will affect later human/official evaluations of Kira's state. Captain Torres frames the situation in terms of company/regulatory obligations about extraction and expresses skepticism, indicating future bureaucratic friction despite Kira's clear, voluntary refusal. Holloway explicitly affirms non-coercion (Kira may leave anytime), which formalizes the plant community's stance and is likely to be cited in future disputes or negotiations. There are no contradictions with the previously established facts.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="DR_CHEN_SCAN_NO_FOREIGN_SUBSTANCES">Dr. Chen's medical scan found no foreign substances in Kira's system.</fact>
          <fact id="DR_CHEN_SCAN_INDICATES_IMPROVED_METRICS">Dr. Chen reports Kira's vitals are normal and her neural patterns/metabolic/stress/social-integration metrics are actually healthier than baseline (stress below norm; social-integration metrics high).</fact>
          <fact id="TORRES_CITES_COMPANY_RESCUE_PROTOCOLS">Captain Torres invokes company/regulatory procedures regarding extraction/rescue and expresses that standard protocol expects them to extract a survivor, signaling potential bureaucratic/legal obligations or friction.</fact>
          <fact id="HOLLOWAY_AFFIRMS_NONCOERCION">Holloway explicitly states that Kira is free to leave anytime and that the community would not hold her against her will (formal assertion of non-coercion).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: it opens with "The freighter appears in the sky just after dawn," and the previous passage ended the evening before with the narrator going to sleep. The freighter's landing, the short formal exchange, Dr. Chen's on-the-spot scan, Holloway's approach, and Torres' request to be convinced are all events that plausibly take place in one continuous morning encounter. The scene ends when Torres agrees to let Kira "show me," which is a natural breakpoint before a longer tour. The gap between passages is an overnight interval (sleep, preparation, and the freighter's transit). The on-site medical scan and the conversation would take only minutes to a few tens of minutes, so the passage itself spans a short period (roughly tens of minutes) while the gap from the previous passage is an overnight ~12 hours.</reasoning>
        <starts>~06:15</starts>
        <ends>~06:40</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>Approximately 12 hours overnight (previous passage ~18:15 evening; freighter arrives just after dawn). During the gap characters sleep or rest, make final preparations, the community gathers, and the freighter travels to the site.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (evening sleep → dawn arrival) matches the previous passage's "tomorrow" and last-evening sleep. A 10–30 minute window is reasonable for a landing, short debrief, an on-site medical scan, and an initial negotiation. The quick medical scan and immediate social interaction are realistic for a field rescue team and an inquisitive captain; the longer facility tour is deferred, which fits the pacing. No major timing contradictions are evident.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Kira (the narrator), Scout, and Holloway are explicitly present/active in the passage. The passage also opens immediately after the prior scene where Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Florence, and Buddy were present; the text says “the whole community is gathered,” which indicates those previously-present community members remain present for this scene. No characters from the provided list enter during this passage (Torres and Dr. Chen appear in the text but are not in the available-character list), and nobody from the available list exits before the passage ends. The only provided entity relevant to the scene is the planet/location where the facility/community is located.</reasoning>

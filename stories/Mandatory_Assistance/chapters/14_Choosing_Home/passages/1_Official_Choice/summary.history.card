      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage resolves the freighter arrival and Kira's immediate refusal of extraction, but leaves almost all structural, resource, political, and safety questions open. The key payoff is the moment-of-choice and the formal encounter with human authorities (Captain Torres and Dr. Chen), which moves the narrative into a new phase — negotiation/assessment between human institutions and the plant community. Most prior logistical, governance, environmental, and strategic promises remain live because the freighter's arrival creates new pressures (legal, political, evidentiary) rather than resolving underlying fragilities. The passage also introduces several new setups: human institutional response (company/protocols), a planned tour/assessment that will act as evidence, and the medical validation that may be leveraged in policy or PR decisions. No earlier promises besides the freighter ETA/interaction are fully closed here; nothing substantial about resources, cleanup, hostile-plant motivations, or long-term governance is settled.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="FREIGHTER_ETA_EXTRACTION">The freighter (Harmony Prospect) arrived as predicted and engaged directly with Kira. The extraction sequence began: Captain Torres and Dr. Chen met Kira, Dr. Chen scanned her, and a formal evaluation/tour was requested. The timing and initial human-plant interaction that the ETA promise left unresolved have now occurred.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">Durable reconciliation and governance consequences remain untested by future stressors; the community still needs institutionalized trust structures and a stress test under outside scrutiny (human visitors).</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">Deeper motivations and adaptation of hostile plant forces remain unexplained and dangerous; the arrival of humans could change threat dynamics but does not resolve their strategic intent.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">High morale exists, but resource limits and infrastructure fragility remain; outside attention and potential demands may increase strain rather than resolve it.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Formal negotiation of territorial rituals, physical and social boundary markers remains unresolved as the community's social space solidifies—now potentially complicated by human legal/ownership concerns.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">Enemy territorial marking and implications for escalation/negotiation remain unaddressed and unchanged by the freighter arrival.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Political consequences and possible factionalism in plant governance remain unresolved; human scrutiny (Torres/Chen) will test Holloway's and the community's claims of autonomy and authority.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">Who will reliably sustain day-to-day medical and caregiving routines under resource strain remains unsettled; human presence may alter expectations or workloads but does not solve the issue.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy's expanded role and emotional investment continue; its long-term willingness and burnout risk remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal protocols for boundary control and handoff still need negotiation as social geography becomes fixed; human extraction/refusal magnifies the need for clear rituals/protocols.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's operational and emotional dependence on plant allies remains a structural vulnerability for future choices and missions, now evidenced by her refusal to leave and likely to be scrutinized by humans.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Durable shelter, supplies, sustainable systems and reliable external support remain necessary but unresolved; the human visit does not change underlying material needs.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Critical shortages and resource flows remain pressing and unaddressed by the freighter visit (no resupply was accepted or discussed materially).</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Questions about elder communications and possible deception remain live; human inspection may probe claims but does not yet resolve authenticity concerns.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">Whether emergent collaborative practices will be codified, contested, or institutionalized is still unresolved; the human delegation’s arrival will test informal governance.</promise>
          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Many repairs and technical/logistical tasks (water, medical, structural) remain unfinished and must be coordinated; the freighter visit may create new demands for coordination.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">Physical damage and depleted consumables persist; the passage does not address scope or timeline for rebuilding.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner remains an irreplaceable asset with injuries that may limit future risky operations; no new recovery information is provided.</promise>
          <promise id="CHEMICAL_NEUTRALIZATION_SECONDARY_HAZARD">Potential toxic residues and long-term environmental/health hazards from previous neutralization are still unaddressed.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_DEPLETION_CRISIS">Remedy has restarted production but the longer-term consequences of prior depletion and time to full recovery remain unclear.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_SUSTAINABILITY_FAILURE">Velvet's growth and design work are impressive but long-term sustainability under continued strain remains a question.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner's recovery is improving but full restoration and limits on future operations remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_KIRA_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_ROUTINE">Holloway's evacuation contingency exists; its broader adequacy (for other scenarios, or if Kira changes her mind) remains unproven and untested by formal legal scrutiny.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TARGET_SOUTHWEST_LIFE_SUPPORT">Southwest life-support vulnerabilities remain a live technical concern; not addressed here.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy's shift toward QoL and tactical support creates downstream allocation trade-offs that remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_AFTERMATH_AND_COUNTERADAPTATION">Whether hostile plants will adapt tactically after losing the command node is still unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_OFFENSIVE_TACTIC_POTENTIAL">Previously-productive tactics need refinement; improvised technical tactics were used but require further development.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_RECOVERY_AND_CAPACITY">Remedy is producing again but has not demonstrated full restoration of defensive/production capacity.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_CRITICAL_INJURY_RISK">Runner remains a critical asset with uncertain availability for future high-risk missions.</promise>
          <promise id="AFTERMATH_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_REPAIR">Rebuilding tasks remain incomplete and will need ongoing coordination and materials.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_DISPOSAL_AND_CONTAMINATION_CLEANUP">Long-term disposal and environmental cleanup of the command node remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_ROLE_EXPANSION">Remedy's broadened role into QoL and tactical support continues to create social and resource consequences to be worked out.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_FRIENDLY_DESIGN_INTEGRATION">Human ergonomics and permanency of interspecies space-use remain unresolved; the tour may clarify, but not yet resolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_PRESSURE_FROM_COMFORTS">Comfort-producing projects consume resources and may create future trade-offs and political tensions; unchanged by refusal to be extracted.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_CONSEQUENCES_OF_STAY_OR_LEAVE">Kira's decision to stay has immediate emotional closure but longer-term interpersonal, political, and resource implications of her choice remain to be explored.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_IMPACT_OF_SIGNAL_OPERATIONS">Improvised antenna/amplification consumed materials; downstream resource allocation consequences remain to be tracked.</promise>
          <promise id="AFTER-EVENTS_POLITICAL_FALLOUT">How the community will handle longer-term political fallout from aiding human contact and Kira's choice remains open and likely heightened by this encounter.</promise>
          <promise id="HARMONY_PROSPECT_OFFICIAL_RESPONSE">New: The company's procedural and legal reaction to a rescued person refusing extraction—possible reporting, forced-retrieval orders, or diplomatic negotiation—has been set up but not resolved.</promise>
          <promise id="OFFICIAL_ASSESSMENT_TOUR">New: Captain Torres has agreed to tour the facility and question members as evidence to determine whether Kira is being held or is an autonomous resident; the tour's findings will have political and legal consequences.</promise>
          <promise id="MEDICAL_VALIDATION_IMPACT">New: Dr. Chen’s initial scan found Kira physically and neurologically healthy; how that medical validation will be used by the company (to concede, to classify as voluntary, or to pursue other action) is an open question.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_AUTHORITY_VS_PLANT_GOVERNANCE">New: The interaction tests plant governance claims (Holloway's authority and promises of free choice) against human institutional regulations—this conflict is unresolved and may set precedent.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_LEGAL_STATUS_DECLARATION">New: Kira's formal refusal of rescue creates a legal/administrative status question (refusal, waiver, or forced recovery) that remains to be adjudicated.</promise>
          <promise id="TOUR_AS_EVIDENCE">New: The promised facility tour functions as a setup: what Torres and Dr. Chen see and report will act as evidence shaping subsequent corporate or public decisions.</promise>
          <promise id="POTENTIAL_FORCED_EXTRACTION">New: The possibility that the company will escalate beyond a diagnostic tour (returning with mandate, legal pressure, or enforcement) is introduced by the human delegation's interest and remains open.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selected facts are events and statements that affect future social/political dynamics and rescue outcomes: the human freighter actually arriving and landing; named human contacts (Captain Torres, Dr. Chen) who may act later; an in-person medical evaluation confirming Kira is neurologically sound and in improved health (corroborating Buddy and prior wellness facts); Kira's explicit, in-person refusal to be extracted (reaffirming her commitment to stay); Holloway's public assertion that Kira is free to leave; and Captain Torres' skepticism and agreement to tour the facility (which sets up potential negotiation/verification scenes). No details flagged as conflicts with previously established facts.</reasoning>

      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The previous passage ends the night before the freighter's scheduled arrival; the current passage opens with the freighter appearing "just after dawn." That places the start on the morning immediately following the previous passage. The scene covers the landing, an initial exchange with Captain Torres and Dr. Chen, and a quick medical scan and negotiation to tour the facility — events that plausibly unfold over minutes to an hour. The passage ends when Torres agrees to be shown the facility. The gap from the previous passage is essentially overnight (hours, not days). Timing is plausible for narrative flow; the only minor realism caveat is the speed and conclusiveness of the medical scan, which in real life might take longer or require more analysis, but is acceptable within typical story compression.</reasoning>
        <starts>dawn (~06:20)</starts>
        <ends>morning (~07:00)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>Overnight — roughly 8–12 hours between the end of the previous passage (the evening/night before the freighter arrives) and this passage's start. During that gap the narrator sleeps/reflects and the freighter approaches on schedule.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The overnight gap fits the prior scene (the narrator intended to tell the freighter the next day). The freighter arriving just after dawn and the community gathering are believable. The landing, greeting, short conversation and an on-the-spot scan can reasonably occur within 10–40 minutes in fiction; the only slight timing stretch is how immediately conclusive the medical scan appears, but that is a minor narrative compression rather than a serious inconsistency.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I read the passage and noted named characters who appear. Kira Voss is the narrator ('I'). Scout is explicitly present at the start watching the freighter. Captain Torres and Dr. Chen are named in the passage but are not among the provided character cards, so they cannot be listed as card paths. Holloway is named later as approaching the group (she arrives during the interaction), so she counts as entering during the scene. No character from the provided list is described as leaving before the end of the passage, so the EXITED list is empty. The scene takes place at the facility on the planet; the only provided entity that matches is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage reports the arriving freighter (Harmony Prospect) landing and its crew (Captain Torres and Dr. Chen) coming to extract Kira. Kira publicly refuses extraction, stating she chooses to remain with the plant community. Dr. Chen medically scans Kira and finds normal vitals, no foreign substances, and neural patterns indicating Kira is healthier than baseline. Captain Torres is skeptical and cites regulations; Holloway affirms Kira's autonomy and community status and invites Torres to inspect the facility. Torres agrees to tour to verify voluntariness. I removed the now-fulfilled bullet about the freighter being 'due to arrive' and replaced it with the landing and refusal events, and consolidated related details about the extraction attempt and verification steps.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural‑link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion and stayed close to her.
          - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ coordination and a massive command node were neutralized; Runner and Remedy removed the node’s root system to prevent contamination.
          - Facility sustained heavy structural and resource damage; core life‑support and medical systems remain functional; key plants (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) are injured or regenerating.
          - Governance shifted after recovery: Holloway acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically without dominating decisions.
          - Reconstruction is committee‑driven and species‑aware; plants were repurposed for rebuilding roles (resonance/amplification, structural growth, environmental/chemical work, social curation).
          - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal; the community built a directional antenna integrating Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Florence and Holloway and transmitted coordinates and Kira’s status.
          - Human commercial freighter Harmony Prospect acknowledged the signal and has arrived and landed.
          - Captain Torres and medical officer Dr. Chen came ashore to extract Kira.
          - Kira publicly refused extraction, declaring she is choosing to remain with the plant community; the community (and Scout) were present and supportive.
          - Dr. Chen scanned Kira: vitals normal, no foreign substances, neural patterns indicate Kira is healthier than baseline and psychologically well‑integrated.
          - Torres expressed regulatory concern and skepticism; Holloway affirmed Kira’s autonomy and value and invited Torres to tour the facility to judge for himself.
          - Torres agreed to tour the facility to verify that Kira’s decision is voluntary.

      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV feelings: The passage centers on a calm, resolute pride. Kira experiences acute anticipation as the freighter arrives, then steadies into certainty and conviction when offered extraction — she deliberately claims belonging and declines rescue. Her feelings oscillate from nervous excitement (Scout mirrors this) to serene firmness and then to vindicated relief as the medical scan and Holloway's testimony confirm her capacity and agency. The immediate interpersonal beats (Torres's protocolling, Dr. Chen's suspicion) provoke mild friction, but Kira remains emotionally centered and unshaken.

          Reader experience: The reader shares the initial lift of anticipation and suspense (the long-awaited rescue finally appears). That spike is quickly reframed into a poignant, slightly unexpected emotional turn when Kira refuses rescue — generating surprise, warmth, and admiration. The encounter with Torres and Dr. Chen adds a note of tension and procedural skepticism, but the medical validation and Holloway's defense produce a satisfying emotional payoff: relief and moral vindication for Kira's choice. Overall the reader moves from eager suspense to a bittersweet, affirming closure.

          Multiple beats or one tone: There are three clear emotional beats here rather than a single monolithic tone: (1) anticipatory uplift at arrival, (2) defiant belonging when Kira refuses rescue and negotiates with skeptical humans, and (3) validation/relief as scans and testimony confirm her decision. The passage balances tension (human skepticism) with warmth (community presence and Kira’s conviction), ending on a quietly victorious, accepting note.

          Comparison to prior pattern: This continues the story's recurring anticipation → tension → acceptance arc but with a meaningful evolution. Earlier scenes built toward external rescue and repeatedly framed hope as something uncertain or costly; here the rescue moment becomes the occasion for resolved agency and belonging rather than passive relief. The emotional repetition (anticipation followed by institutional friction) is present, but the payoff differs: instead of procedural delay or bitter disappointment, Kira achieves authentic belonging and self-determination. This passage functions as an emotional culmination — it reframes earlier anxieties about rescue into a clear, earned choice and reduces the story's prior cycles of helplessness by giving Kira the final, decisive voice.
        </reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="anticipation, tension">POV: Sharp, eager anticipation as the freighter descends — Kira is calm but inwardly charged ('big moment'), supported by the communal presence (Scout bouncing). Cause: the long-awaited human contact and potential extraction arriving at last. Reader: feels suspenseful uplift and curiosity about what the freighter will mean for Kira and the plant-community; underlying tension because this moment could resolve or destabilize everything.</beat>
          <beat tags="belonging, frustration">POV: Quiet, resolute belonging and moral defiance when Kira refuses extraction — she frames the plants as a community that values her contribution and asserts agency against protocol. Cause: Torres’ protocols and Dr. Chen’s immediate suspicion prompt friction; Kira's calm rebuttal converts potential coercion into a stand for identity. Reader: experiences surprise and warmth at Kira’s decision, mixed with frustration/tension as the human officers doubt her motives and attempt to medicalize her choice.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, acceptance">POV: Vindicated relief and steady acceptance when medical scans confirm Kira is healthy and Holloway defends her agency — Kira feels validated in calling the facility home. Cause: Dr. Chen’s scan readings and Holloway’s testimony remove the claim of impairment/coercion and allow the standoff to move toward mutual appraisal rather than forced extraction.

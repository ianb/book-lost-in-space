  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I tracked which explicit setups from the previous open-promises were executed by the events of this passage, which remain relevant, and which can reasonably be allowed to lapse. The core immediate action promised last passage was the freighter tour; that occurred and paid off. Dr. Chen's scan and her communication about the results happened (she showed results to Torres), and Torres did challenge/question the decision (skepticism, invoking protocol) even though she ultimately accepted Kira's refusal — so the earlier tentative setup that Torres might push back was realized in part. Several older, tentative operational/setup promises (especially ones many passages old and not reinforced here) can be lapsed because this passage focused on the tour, social validation, and an immediate human response rather than logistics/repairs or exhaustion. New, concrete setups introduced here that will matter later include the emergency beacon / ability for Kira to call for extraction later and the signed official declination paperwork; both are explicit, immediate actions with future implications (firm). I also flagged softer new hooks: that Torres/Dr. Chen will report back to the company (tentative) and that the successful tour creates a potential opening for future human–plant collaboration (tentative). Finally, I carried forward the ongoing cultural/trust/design promises that this passage reinforced (trust solidification, Kira's role in design, cultural renovation, Scout's social role, etc.), plus the still-open risk of broader human institutional reaction and public exposure even though the first contact went well.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="FREIGHTER_WILL_TOUR_FACILITY">Torres agreed to inspect the facility before deciding; the passage shows Kira leading Torres and Dr. Chen through the acoustic chambers, living/creative spaces, and meeting community members — the tour occurred.</promise>
      <promise id="DR_CHEN_WILL_REPORT_FINDINGS">Dr. Chen ran scans, noted positive indicators, and pulled Torres aside to show results; the medical findings were communicated and influenced Torres' decision.</promise>
      <promise id="TORRES_MAY_CHALLENGE_DECISION_OR_FORCE_EXTRACTION">Torres invoked regulations and expressed skepticism (a challenge), questioned whether the environment is appropriate, and pushed for assurance — the expected bureaucratic pushback happened even though it did not result in forced extraction.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_EXHAUSTION_RISK">Florence had previously been flagged as potentially exhausted from contribution. In this passage she appears engaged, lucid, and actively testifies to Kira's positive influence; the exhaustion risk is not reinforced and can be set aside for now.</promise>
      <promise id="STRUCTURAL_DAMAGE_REPAIR_NEEDS">Ongoing structural repair requirements were earlier a tentative operational promise. The passage focuses on social validation and aesthetics; repairs/structural damage are not mentioned or progressed and this older tentative thread receives no reinforcement, so it can lapse for now.</promise>
    </lapsed>
    <open>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_WITHDRAW_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="33">Florence previously indicated she might withdraw if rejected; she is supportive here but remains a potential behavioral vulnerability if future conflict or rejection occurs.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_TRUST_SOLIDIFICATION" tentative="true" introduced="36">The community's public support for Kira and their shared celebration reinforce that trust is being solidified, but this remains an ongoing process that could still be tested later.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_TRUST_BUILDING_REQUIRED" tentative="true" introduced="37">Although goodwill is strong now, durable trust and forgiveness are framed as long-term processes that will require continued work and are still outstanding.</promise>
      <promise id="STRUCTURAL_REPAIR_AND_RESOURCE_DRIVE" tentative="false" introduced="37">Ongoing rebuilding and resource-acquisition are operational needs for the community; the freighter visit did not remove these systemic tasks and they remain relevant.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_INCLUSION_AS_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="37">The community's active inclusion (e.g., Florence, Kira) is reinforced by Holloway and others defending Kira; the practice appears to be an emergent norm but its permanence is not guaranteed.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOUT_BRIDGE_ROLE" tentative="true" introduced="37">Scout's emotional/social bridging role is reinforced in the scene (comforting, greeting, signalling belonging) and remains an ongoing narrative function.</promise>
      <promise id="WESTERN_WING_DESIGN_PROJECT" tentative="false" introduced="38">Planned near-term design/repair tasks (western wing project) remain outstanding; the passage reinforces design practices but doesn't resolve specific project work.</promise>
      <promise id="CULTURAL_RENOVATION_AND_AESTHETIC_INTEGRATION" tentative="false" introduced="38">The tour explicitly demonstrates the facility's aesthetic and cultural integration of human-centered design—this ongoing cultural renovation continues to shape life and remain consequential.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_ROLE_IN_DESIGN_AND_DECISIONS" tentative="false" introduced="38">Multiple characters explicitly credit Kira with shaping design choices; her ongoing involvement in decisions is reinforced and remains an active plot element.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_SOLIDIFICATION_AS_HARMONY_NORM" tentative="true" introduced="38">The emergent co-creative pattern of mutual respect and integrated design is reinforced by the public tour and celebration, but whether it stabilizes permanently is still open.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_CHANGES_PERSIST" tentative="true" introduced="40">The passage shows community practices (design sensitivity, inclusion, redemption) persisting in the short term; long-term persistence remains to be tested.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_RESPONSE_TO_KIRA_DECISION" tentative="true" introduced="40">The immediate human response (Torres accepts Kira's choice for now, leaves a beacon and paperwork) is positive, but broader bureaucratic, legal, or reputational consequences from the company remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="41">The tour exposed the plant community to human officials; while the first impression was favorable, this remains a risk vector for future misunderstanding, scrutiny, or bureaucratic consequences.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_CAN_REQUEST_EXTRACTION_LATER" tentative="false" introduced="42">Torres explicitly leaves an emergency beacon and contact information so Kira can request extraction in the future if she changes her mind—an explicit actionable option for later.</promise>
      <promise id="SIGNED_DECLINES_RESCUE_PAPERWORK" tentative="false" introduced="42">Kira signed the official declaration declining rescue; that paperwork now exists and may have legal or procedural significance for future interactions with the company.</promise>
      <promise id="TORRES_WILL_REPORT_TOUR_AND_SCAN_TO_COMPANY" tentative="true" introduced="42">Dr. Chen and Torres will carry scan results and their impressions back to whatever company apparatus sent the freighter; that report is likely to influence future official responses but is not resolved here.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_PLANT_COLLABORATION_POTENTIAL" tentative="true" introduced="42">The successful tour suggests a new soft opening for future collaboration or at least communication between human officials and the plant community; this is a speculative possibility introduced by the positive contact.</promise>

  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>The passage describes the freighter captain (Torres) and Dr. Chen touring the facility, observing demonstrations (Runner's resonance bowl, Velvet's human-centered spaces, Remedy's fragrance work), and concluding Kira is thriving. Critically, Torres asks Kira to sign an official declaration refusing extraction; Kira signs. Torres/Dr. Chen leave an emergency beacon and contact info and depart. These are actionable, lasting states (a formal refusal on record; an emergency beacon and contact left by the freighter) that matter for later political/logistical continuity. Most other details (community members crediting Kira, demonstrations of design changes, Buddy's pride, celebration) restate or illustrate facts already in the record (Kira's integration, community acknowledgement, Buddy's supportive tone, Dr. Chen/Torres involvement) and therefore are not added as new long-term facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_SIGNED_OFFICIAL_DECLINATION_OF_EXTRACTION">Kira signed an official declaration in person refusing extraction from the arriving freighter and formally choosing to remain at the facility.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FREIGHTER_LEFT_EMERGENCY_BEACON_AND_CONTACT_INFO">Captain Torres and Dr. Chen left an emergency beacon and contact information at the facility and pledged to return if Kira activates the beacon requesting extraction.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: The previous passage ends with Captain Torres agreeing to be shown the facility; there's no indication of a break. The previous outline time to use as reference is 2687-05-16T11:00 (authoritative). The current passage opens with the narrator leading Torres and Dr. Chen through the facility and ends when the freighter lifts off after paperwork is signed and goodbyes exchanged. The scene describes a guided tour (several stops), an on-the-spot medical scan and private consultation, a short conversation, signing of rescue-decline paperwork, and the freighter preparing to depart. These actions fit a single continuous encounter that plausibly takes on the order of tens of minutes rather than hours. Note: a different summary timestamp (~07:00) appears in the prompt, but the instruction specified the authoritative end time 2687-05-16T11:00; I used that as the reference.</reasoning>
    <starts>2687-05-16T11:00</starts>
    <ends>2687-05-16T11:40</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation from the previous passage (0–5 minutes). The tour begins right after Torres agrees to be shown the facility.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. A 30–45 minute window is reasonable for a short guided tour through a few spaces, a quick on-site medical scan and consultation, a private exchange between Dr. Chen and Torres, signing a simple declaration form, and seeing the freighter prepare to depart. No implausible time compression is required; the sequence reads as a single continuous scene with normal pacing.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Start of passage context: the previous-present list shows Kira_Voss, Buddy, Scout, and Holloway were already present at the end of the prior passage, so treat those as present at the start here. The passage introduces additional community members during the tour: Runner emerges, Velvet speaks about design, Remedy shows compounds, and Florence wheels over; these four are not listed in the previous-present set and therefore enter during this scene. No available-character from the provided list leaves before the scene ends; Torres and Dr. Chen do depart, but they are not among the supplied character cards, so they are not listed in the EXITED output. The passage references “Uncharted” (Buddy mentions Kit from Uncharted), which maps to the provided entity card for Uncharted with Maverick Stone.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage documents the freighter team's inspection and departure: Kira gives Torres and Dr. Chen a guided tour that shows how the community incorporated Kira's input into design and daily life; community members (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence) testify that Kira's presence is voluntary and valuable; Scout and Buddy demonstrate affection and cohesion; Dr. Chen's scans confirm Kira is healthy and not coerced; Torres leaves an emergency beacon and paperwork, Kira signs an official declination of rescue, and the freighter departs. I consolidated earlier granular lists of community roles into a single concise bullet about rebuilding and role assignment, and retained only plot-relevant details (the inspection, medical confirmation, official refusal, beacon, departure, and celebration).</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Mining shuttle crashed during approach; Kira Voss survived with AI Buddy and companion Scout; SAM remains offline.
      - Hull breach revealed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; survivors sheltered using local plants and the shuttle.
      - Hostile plants coordinated assaults from an underground root command node; defenders forced the node to surface, extracted and destroyed it, ending coordinated attacks.
      - Victory cost heavy damage and supplies; survivors were injured but recovered; Florence reintegrated and the group shifted from mere survival to cooperative recovery.
      - The community rebuilt the facility as a shared human–plant habitat and assigned practical and social roles to members (construction, environment, defenses, medical, design, coordination, emotional support).
      - Buddy and Scout integrated with the community; Buddy helped social integration and communication.
      - Buddy detected an artificial signal; the community constructed a plant‑based uplink and Buddy contacted the commercial freighter Harmony Prospect, which acknowledged one survivor and planned extraction in ~48 hours.
      - Kira struggled with leaving, ultimately decided to stay, and planned to tell the arriving freighter in person.
      - The freighter Harmony Prospect arrived; Captain Torres and medical officer Dr. Chen disembarked to assess and extract Kira.
      - Kira led Torres and Dr. Chen on a facility tour demonstrating how her feedback shaped acoustic chambers, living spaces, fragrances, and other designs; community members credited her influence.
      - Holloway and Florence publicly affirmed Kira’s autonomy and value; Scout and Buddy demonstrated clear affection and loyalty toward Kira.
      - Dr. Chen’s scans confirmed Kira is physically and neurologically healthy and not coerced; Torres accepted the evidence, left an emergency beacon and contact info, and requested a signed official declination.
      - Kira signed the extraction-decline paperwork; the freighter departed; the community celebrated Kira’s decision to remain and she felt certain and at home.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV feelings: Kira is steady, certain, and quietly proud. The tour lets her show tangible evidence of belonging (built spaces, altered procedures, people who credit her), and the medical/official confirmation removes the last procedural doubt; signing the declaration is the emotional culmination — a deliberate, unambiguous act that converts private conviction into public fact. Reader experience: relief, closure, and warm satisfaction. The scene defuses prior suspense and moral conflict into an earned, domestic triumph: the reader gets payoff for the long arc of integration and the rescue dilemma. Emotional structure: there are multiple beats but one dominant tone — acceptance/resolution/joy — with a short flicker of institutional tension (Torres' skepticism and the medical check) that resolves into legitimacy. Compared with the story so far, this passage is the resolution point for the stay-vs-rescue arc: earlier suspense, distrust, and fractured relationships give way to validated belonging and communal recognition. Surprises: there are no large, plot-level surprises here; the actions generally follow from prior setup (Torres' tour, medical scan, Holloway's advocacy). Small emotional reversals (authorities showing humane flexibility) are present but consistent with previous beats. Character change/revelation: Kira finalizes an identity-shift by publicly choosing to stay; Holloway and others show relational growth (advocacy and incorporation of Kira's perspective); Florence publicly credits Kira and frames her own partial redemption; Buddy manifests emotional maturation (pride/contentment); Scout's exuberant affection concretely demonstrates the personal bonds Kira has formed. Overall the passage is closure-oriented, converting earlier tension into communal affirmation and quiet celebration.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="wonder, intimacy">Tour/demo beat: Kira leads Torres and Dr. Chen through the facility and watches allies (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) describe how Kira's input changed design and function. POV: Kira feels proud, validated and intimate — her contributions are visible and acknowledged. Reader: experiences warm wonder as the alien architecture and small humanizing details (acoustics, seating, fragrance) become evidence of true integration.</beat>
      <beat tags="conflict, relief">Scrutiny and verification: Holloway verbally defends Kira's autonomy and Dr. Chen runs scans; Torres briefly embodies institutional skepticism. POV: Kira experiences a momentary tension (being judged) that is quickly resolved into relief when the scan and Holloway's testimony confirm voluntary, healthy flourishing. Reader: feels a brief uptick of suspense that releases into reassurance when official protocols accept the choice.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, joy">Decision and aftermath: Kira signs the official declaration, rejects rescue, and the freighter departs. POV: she feels certainty and calm finality; she experiences belonging as the community celebrates. Reader: experiences cathartic closure, warmth, and uplift — the long arc closes on a quiet, joyful note rather than melodrama.</beat>

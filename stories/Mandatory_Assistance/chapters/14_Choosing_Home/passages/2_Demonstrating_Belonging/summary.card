  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>I track who's where, which objects were introduced or moved, and which systems are active at the scene's end. The freighter (Harmony Prospect) has landed earlier, its two human crew members (Captain Torres and Dr. Chen) inspected the facility, reviewed medical scans, and obtained Kira's signed refusal of rescue. Torres and Dr. Chen depart on the freighter after leaving an emergency beacon and contact information for future extraction; the freighter lifts off and is gone. The plant-built facility remains intact and fully operational: Runner's acoustic chamber functioned and Runner emerged from underground; Runner's underground resonance network is active; Velvet's translucent growth panels and ergonomic seating are present and lit; Remedy's scent/chemical enhancements are deployed; Holloway's bioluminescent lighting is on. Scout, Florence, Holloway, Runner, Velvet, Remedy and other community members are physically gathered outside/around the facility, having witnessed the exchange and now celebrating. Kira stands outside the facility with Scout; she has signed paperwork formally declining rescue (a signed declaration exists, in Torres's possession or recorded). Dr. Chen had used a medical scanner and reviewed scan results with Torres; those results informed Torres's decision and are recorded. No physical damage or injuries are reported. Time is shortly after dawn; weather/visibility is sufficient for the freighter to ascend and leave. The community noise level is high (celebration) and the facility's artistic/functional systems are active and humming.</reasoning>
    <state>Shortly after dawn the Harmony Prospect has lifted off and departed; an emergency beacon and contact information have been left at the plant facility for future extraction. Kira stands outside the intact, fully functioning plant-built facility with Scout and the assembled community (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, and others). Runner's acoustic chamber and underground resonance network are active; Velvet's translucent growth panels and seating, Remedy's scent enhancements, and Holloway's bioluminescent lighting are operating. Kira has signed official paperwork declining rescue; medical scans showing healthy vitals/neural readings were reviewed and recorded. The community is celebrating; no physical injuries or damage are present.</state>
  </physical-reality>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      Reasoning:
      - What was paid off: The freighter inspection actually happened and produced an outcome: Torres toured the facility, reviewed Dr. Chen's scans, and accepted that Kira's refusal was voluntary. That resolves the previously open promise that the inspection tour would determine whether the freighter accepts the refusal. Dr. Chen's medical evaluation was explicitly used in Torres' decision, so the promise about the medical evaluation affecting authority decisions was also paid off.

      - What remains: Nearly every other institutional, strategic, and long‑term thread from the previous list remains open. The passage is a contained, positive resolution of the immediate rescue/refusal encounter, but it introduces no new long‑term institutional closures: company reporting, publicity, legal consequences, enforcement risk, resource/survival logistics, formal governance, Florence's formal status, SAM's status, command node intelligence opportunities, hostile threats and adaptation, sustainability of Remedy's comforts, and many others are untouched or only reinforced socially. Those remain active narrative promises.

      - What lapsed: Nothing in the previous open list is abandoned or rendered moot by this passage. The passage reduces the immediacy of enforcement at this moment but does not remove the possibility that the company or authorities will act later, so that promise remains open rather than lapsed.

      - New promises: This passage stages actions (paperwork, an emergency beacon, Torres' acceptance) but those actions are introduced and executed within the scene; they create future consequences (a legal record, an extraction mechanism, and a company report to come) but those consequences are continuations or instantiations of previously open threads rather than wholly new unresolved promises. For that reason I record no wholly new unresolved promises introduced here.
    </reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="FREIGHTER_INSPECTION_TOUR_OUTCOME">Captain Torres agreed to tour the facility to evaluate whether Kira's refusal was voluntary — the tour occurred, Torres judged the community non‑coercive and accepted Kira's choice.</promise>
      <promise id="MEDICAL_EVALUATION_IMPACT_ON_AUTHORITY_DECISION">Dr. Chen's scans were shown and explicitly influenced Torres' decision; the medical evaluation was used to validate Kira's fitness and voluntariness.</promise>

      <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">Whether Florence's earlier fabricated inputs will be formally recorded, trusted, or adjudicated remains unresolved; the freighter visit does not settle institutional recordkeeping or trust procedures.</promise>
      <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">The emergent tendency to value useful contributions over provenance has social traction but whether it hardens into governance or policy is still open.</promise>

      <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence's formal exile status is an institutional fact that social acceptance hasn't erased; the legal/political status remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The operational and political ripple effects of Florence's fabrications still need auditing and investigation.</promise>
      <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Coordination is functioning now, but long‑term leadership stability and conflict resolution procedures after betrayal remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM's status and possible role are still unaddressed and unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">A comprehensive long‑term survival, logistics, and relocation plan remains necessary and urgent, especially now that Kira stays and the freighter has arrived.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Formal governance structures, membership rules, and decision procedures remain unsettled and will be pressured by Kira's continuing presence and the freighter visit.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_THREAT">Material, chemical, and energy constraints and personnel fatigue remain potential limits on rebuilding and future operations.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_CONCENTRATED_DEPLOYMENT_RECOVERY">Sustainability and resupply issues around Remedy's enhancements remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">Long‑term habitability and structural robustness still need planning and resources.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_ADAPTATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_LOSS">Risk that hostiles adapt tactically after command node loss remains an active strategic concern.</promise>
      <promise id="POST_BATTLE_RESOURCE_AND_MEDICAL_CRISIS">Ongoing medical and resource stresses over a prolonged period remain unresolved even after the freighter arrival.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_OUTSIDE_PERIMETER_RISK">Risks associated with externalized enemy hardware and retrieval remain unaddressed.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_ANALYSIS_OPPORTUNITY">The extracted command node still offers intelligence opportunities requiring protocols and resources to exploit.</promise>
      <promise id="FACILITY_REPAIR_TIMELINE_AND_RESOURCE_REQUEST">Velvet's rebuilding timeline and external sourcing needs are still outstanding.</promise>
      <promise id="MULTIFUNCTIONAL_INFRASTRUCTURE">Runner's repurposed systems have multi‑use utility; longer‑term tactical, cultural, and security consequences remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_ENVIRONMENTAL_ENHANCEMENTS">Remedy's shift to comfort and scents raises sustainability and prioritization questions that are unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="VELVET_HUMAN_ERGONOMICS_INTEGRATION">Velvet's integration of human ergonomics into growth projects suggests future resource and design tradeoffs that need formalization.</promise>
      <promise id="SOCIAL_GOVERNANCE_INSTITUTIONALIZATION">Daily collaborative norms are practiced; whether these become formal governance, crediting, exile/forgiveness procedures, or face pushback remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_LEAVING_CONFLICT">Although Kira refused extraction, the political/policy consequences of her refusal and how the freighter/human authorities will respond remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_TECH_COMMUNICATIONS_CAPABILITY">Demonstrated communications capability is now politically salient given the freighter arrival; future usage and exposure implications remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="FREIGHTER_ARRIVAL_IMPACT">The freighter's arrival has happened physically but its broader impacts on publicity, human intervention, authority claims, and resource flows are still unfolding.</promise>
      <promise id="LEADERSHIP_EVOLUTION_FROM_SOCIAL_CHANGE">Kira's choice will prompt role and leadership evolution; the process and tensions are unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_PERSONAL_IDENTITY_ARC">Kira's choice anchors an arc about belonging vs. origin; the future consequences of that choice will be followed.</promise>
      <promise id="FREIGHTER_RESPONSE_AND_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE">How the freighter/company will report and respond publicly and institutionally to Kira's refusal is now an immediate, unresolved plot thread.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_MEMBERSHIP_FORMALIZATION">With Kira staying, the community will face pressure to formalize membership, rights, and conflict‑resolution procedures; still open.</promise>
      <promise id="CULTURAL_SHIFT_TOWARD_INDIVIDUAL_VALUATION">The shift toward valuing individual voices (including non‑plants) is catalyzed but its durability and limits are untested.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOUT_LONG_TERM_ATTACHMENT">Scout's deep bond remains a salient emotional factor and potential flashpoint if outside actors intervene.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_REHABILITATION_ARC">Florence's social rehabilitation continues to develop; institutional rehabilitation or lingering consequences remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FREIGHTER_REPORTING_AND_PUBLICITY">The freighter must decide how to report this incident to company and authorities; that reporting could create wider publicity, political pressure, or legal consequences for the community.</promise>
      <promise id="POTENTIAL_ENFORCEMENT_OR_ESCALATION">There remains a risk the company or human authorities will attempt coercive/legal measures if they decide the refusal is unacceptable—this enforcement possibility is now an immediate open threat.</promise>
      <promise id="HUMAN_AUTHORITIES_VISIBILITY">The captain's tour and any subsequent report could bring regulatory or law‑enforcement attention to the plant community, with attendant risks and opportunities.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts are those that add durable, story-relevant information beyond the provided summary: concrete, attributed changes to the community’s practices and relationships that will matter later (design influence, cultural integration, and the formal availability of an extraction-without-penalty option). I omitted transient details and items already covered by the summary. No contradictions with prior established facts were found.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_TAUGHT_RUNNER_ACOUSTIC_DESIGN">Kira directly suggested and taught Runner to incorporate acoustic beauty into practical resonance-chamber design; Runner credits Kira as the teacher for that design approach.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_INFLUENCED_COMMUNITY_DESIGN_AESTHETICS">Kira's feedback materially shaped multiple aesthetic/comfort design choices across the community (Velvet's human-centered ergonomic spaces, Runner's acoustic chambers, Remedy's fragrance/ambient-chemistry), shifting some plant activity from strictly survival-focused to human-comfort and aesthetic considerations.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TORRES_OFFERED_NONJUDGMENTAL_EXTRACTION_OPTION">Captain Torres formally left an emergency beacon and contact information and verbally committed that, should Kira choose extraction later, she would be retrieved with 'no judgment, no questions'—a standing, documented option available for future reversal of Kira's decision.</fact>

    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The previous passage ends just after dawn (~06:40). The first line here—"I lead Torres and Dr. Chen through the facility"—implies an immediate transition: Torres agreed to be shown the facility at the end of the prior scene, so the tour begins with little or no delay. The passage covers a sequence of short events: visiting the acoustic chamber (quick demo), Velvet's spaces, Remedy's compounds, brief witness statements from Holloway and Florence, Scout greeting, Dr. Chen and Torres conferring over scan results, Torres preparing and presenting paperwork, signing, freighter departure, and a short celebration. Reasonable per-stop times (demo + explanation) are on the order of 2–5 minutes each; the private conferral and paperwork add a few more minutes; boarding/liftoff and community send-off add another ~5–10 minutes. Summing those gives an estimated duration in the 20–45 minute range. There are no explicit long-time markers in the text, so the passage most likely starts immediately after the previous one (~06:40) and ends within the next half hour to hour. The timeline is plausible: routine medical scans can be quick, a tour to convince a skeptical rescuer can be done in under an hour, and the freighter crew plausibly allowed that time to confirm the survivor's autonomy before leaving. The only possible tension is that a commercial rescue team might have limited on-scene time, but the narrative justifies the delay (they wait until convinced and complete paperwork), so this is believable.</reasoning>
    <starts>~06:40</starts>
    <ends>~07:10</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none (immediate continuation; essentially immediate — a few minutes at most to assemble before the tour starts)</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The activities described (short demonstrations, quick scans, brief private discussion, signing of a waiver/declaration, and departure) can reasonably fit into ~20–45 minutes. If anything, the timeline assumes the freighter crew is willing to stay slightly longer than a rapid-extraction window, but that is justified in-scene (Torres waits to be convinced and completes paperwork), so no major timing problems.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters included are those from the provided character list who are explicitly present or speak in the passage. Kira (the narrator) leads Torres and Dr. Chen (mentioned but not in the available-characters list). Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, and Scout all appear and speak or act. Runner "emerges from underground," but Runner was listed as present at the end of the previous passage, so they are not counted as an entrant here. Torres and Dr. Chen depart, but they are not among the available character cards, so they are not listed in ENTERED/EXITED. No characters from the provided list enter the scene during this passage, and none of those present leave before the passage ends.

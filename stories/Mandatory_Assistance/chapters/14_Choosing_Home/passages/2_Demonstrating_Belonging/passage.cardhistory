        I lead Torres and Dr. Chen through the facility.

        First stop: Runner's acoustic chambers.

        "Stand here," I tell Torres, gesturing to the resonance bowl.

        She steps in skeptically. "What—"

        "Say something."

        "This is ridiculous," Torres says.

        Her voice echoes in harmonics, the chamber singing along with her words. Her expression shifts from skepticism to wonder.

        "How does this work?" Dr. Chen asks, scanning the structure.

        Runner emerges from underground. "Geometric vine patterns create resonance at specific frequencies. Art and function together. Kira suggested incorporating acoustic beauty into practical design."

        "You... created music out of utility?" Torres sounds impressed despite herself.

        "Individual voices make better harmony when they contribute uniquely," Runner says. "Kira taught us that."

        Next: Velvet's artistic spaces.

        Torres examines the translucent growth, light filtering through in complex patterns. The ergonomic seating, the comfortable proportions.

        "This is designed for human comfort," Dr. Chen observes.

        "Kira's feedback shaped every decision," Velvet says. "She asked about how spaces feel, not just whether they're functional. Made me think differently about what I create."

        "And you listened to a stranded human's design input?" Torres asks.

        "I listened to a community member's voice," Velvet corrects. "Her perspective made these spaces better."

        Remedy shows their enhancement compounds. "Kira asked about fragrances. Such a small question. But it made me realize chemistry could serve joy, not just survival."

        Torres is beginning to understand. I can see it in how she looks at the facility now—not as captivity but as collaboration.

        Holloway approaches. "Captain, I want to be clear: Kira is free to leave anytime. We value her presence but would never hold her against her will."

        "Why does she matter so much to you?" Torres asks bluntly.

        "Because individual voices create richer harmony than any protocol. Kira's human perspective contributes uniquely. She's not here despite being different—she's valued because being different enriches our community."

        Florence wheels over. "I was exiled from this community. Betrayed their trust. Kira helped me believe redemption through right action was possible. This community creates space for people to choose who they want to be."

        Torres examines Florence carefully. "You're saying she transformed your entire social structure?"

        "We transformed together," Florence says. "Individual voices working in harmony. That's the community Kira chose."

        Scout bounces over to Torres, enthusiastic greeting bounce.

        "What is this?" Torres asks.

        "That's Scout," I say. "They adopted me immediately after my crash. Unconditional loyalty and affection."

        Scout bounces between me and Torres. Love Kira bounce. Happy Kira staying bounce. Want captain to understand bounce.

        Torres watches Scout's obvious affection. "This... this isn't coercion."

        "No," I say simply. "This is family."

        In my mind, Buddy says: "Kira, I want you to know—I'm really proud of us. We built this together."

        "We did, didn't we?"

        "I know I'm not Kit from Uncharted. I couldn't give you witty banter or brilliant insights. But I tried to help."

        "Buddy, you were exactly what I needed. Not Kit. You."

        I can feel Buddy processing that. Something like contentment radiating through our connection.

        Dr. Chen pulls Torres aside. I see them talking quietly, Dr. Chen showing scan results. Torres nods slowly.

        Then Torres returns to me. "Ms. Voss, all indicators show you're thriving here. Healthier than before the crash, psychologically sound, genuinely happy. This is highly irregular, but..." She pauses. "It's your choice. Your life."

        "Thank you."

        "We'll leave an emergency beacon and contact information. If you ever want extraction—no judgment, no questions—activate the beacon and we'll return."

        "I appreciate that," I say. "But I won't be changing my mind."

        Torres pulls out paperwork. "I need you to sign this. Official declaration that you're declining rescue and choosing to remain."

        I sign without hesitation.

        Torres and Dr. Chen prepare to depart. The whole community gathers to see them off.

        "Take care of yourself, Ms. Voss," Torres says.

        "I will. Thank you for understanding."

        "I'm not sure I understand," Torres admits. "But I can see it's real. That's enough."

        The freighter lifts off. I watch it disappear into the sky.

        No regret. No doubt.

        Just certainty.

        This is home.

        The community is quiet for a moment, processing what just happened.

        Then Scout explodes in celebration bounces.

        She stayed! She really stayed! Family forever bounce!

        And everyone starts celebrating.

        Scout bounces between me and Torres—enthusiastic, insistent bounces. The kind that mean affection, that mean please understand, that mean this matters. I've learned to read Scout's language.

        Torres watches Scout's obvious affection. "This... this isn't coercion."

        "No," I say simply. "This is family."

        Then Scout explodes in celebration bounces—the biggest, most joyful bounces I've ever seen. Bouncing in circles around me, against my legs, up and down and around again. Pure, unmistakable happiness.

        And everyone starts celebrating.

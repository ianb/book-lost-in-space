      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I compared the prior open-promises list to events in this passage. The freighter team did the promised tour and used medical scans and direct observation as evidence; Torres accepted Kira’s autonomy for now, left an emergency beacon and paperwork, and departed. Those items from the previous set that were specifically tested by the visit (the tour, the medical validation, the company’s immediate response, the legal declaration, and the demonstration of human-friendly design) are therefore paid off. Nothing in the passage permanently resolves long-term systemic issues (resources, governance, hostile-plant motivations, infrastructure, long-term political fallout, etc.), so those remain open. I introduced new, concrete setups created by this scene (the beacon/protocol, signed legal record and its precedent, the company’s tacit non‑forcible precedent, the demonstrated human-design integration as a precedent, and the morale/consumption consequence of celebration). No previous promise was clearly abandoned or rendered moot; therefore LAPSED_PROMISES is empty.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="OFFICIAL_ASSESSMENT_TOUR">Captain Torres performed the tour of the facility and questioned members as promised; the tour happened and influenced her judgement.</promise>
          <promise id="TOUR_AS_EVIDENCE">What Torres and Dr. Chen saw on the tour served as the evidence used to judge whether Kira was being held; the tour fulfilled that setup.</promise>
          <promise id="MEDICAL_VALIDATION_IMPACT">Dr. Chen's scan confirmed Kira’s health and lucidity and that medical validation was used as evidence during the assessment.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_LEGAL_STATUS_DECLARATION">Kira formally declined rescue and signed the official declaration documenting her refusal.</promise>
          <promise id="HARMONY_PROSPECT_OFFICIAL_RESPONSE">The company delegation's immediate response was non‑escalatory: acceptance of Kira's choice for now, leaving contact info and departing—this resolves the immediate corporate reaction set‑up.</promise>
          <promise id="HUMAN_FRIENDLY_DESIGN_INTEGRATION">Velvet’s spaces and Runner’s acoustic chamber demonstrably incorporate human ergonomics and comfort—Torres observed concrete human-friendly design during the tour.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_KIRA_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_ROUTINE">The freighter left an emergency beacon and contact procedure; Holloway's stated evacuation contingency was exercised and validated in practice.</promise>
        </fulfilled>

          <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy’s expanded role and emotional investment remain a burnout risk and are not resolved by this visit.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">No enduring protocol or ritual for transfer/recognition of boundaries was formalized beyond an emergency beacon—clear procedures remain to be negotiated.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira’s operational and emotional ties to plant allies continue to be a structural vulnerability for future choices and missions.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Durable shelter, supplies, sustainable systems and reliable external support still need to be secured for long-term survival.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Immediate resource shortages and supply flows remain pressing and were not materially changed by the freighter visit.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Questions about elder communications and possible deception remain live; the tour did not resolve authenticity concerns.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">Whether emergent collaborative practices will be codified or contested remains unresolved despite this one inspection.</promise>
          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Many repairs and technical/logistical tasks (water, medical, structural) remain unfinished and must still be coordinated.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">Physical damage and depleted consumables persist and require plans/timelines for rebuilding.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner remains an irreplaceable asset with injuries that could limit future risky operations.</promise>

          <promise id="REMEDY_DEPLETION_CRISIS">Remedy’s production recovery is in progress but long-term stability and capacity remain unclear.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_SUSTAINABILITY_FAILURE">Velvet’s impressive growth/design may yet prove unsustainable under persistent strain.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner’s recovery is improving but full restoration and operational limits remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TARGET_SOUTHWEST_LIFE_SUPPORT">Southwest life-support vulnerabilities remain a live technical concern.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy’s shift toward quality-of-life projects creates downstream trade-offs that need determination.</promise>

          <promise id="RESOURCE_PRESSURE_FROM_COMFORTS">Comfort-producing projects (Velvet, fragrance, etc.) consume resources and may produce future trade-offs and tensions.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_CONSEQUENCES_OF_STAY_OR_LEAVE">Kira’s choice brought emotional closure but longer-term interpersonal, political, and resource implications remain.</promise>

          <promise id="POTENTIAL_FORCED_EXTRACTION">The possibility that the company could later escalate beyond this diagnostic tour (mandate, legal pressure, or enforcement) remains live.</promise>
          <promise id="EMERGENCY_BEACON_PROTOCOL">The freighter left an emergency beacon and contact procedure; this sets a concrete mechanism for future extraction but also creates procedural and jurisdictional questions.</promise>
          <promise id="SIGNED_DECLARATION_PRECEDENT">Kira’s signed refusal creates an official record and a legal precedent that may affect future corporate or public responses.</promise>
          <promise id="COMPANY_PRECEDENT_NONFORCIBLE_RESPONSE">Torres’ choice to accept Kira’s refusal without force sets a potential corporate precedent that could shape later policy or be reversed under pressure.</promise>

        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>Significant, long-term facts in this passage are administrative/behavioral decisions and acknowledgements that will affect future logistics and relationships (e.g., a formal signed refusal, a left emergency beacon, the freighter's departure) and attributions of influence (community members crediting Kira for design changes). I excluded transient or already-captured facts (who was present, Dr. Chen's scan being normal, that Kira refused extraction) and duplicated items already in the fact list. No statements in the passage contradict previously established facts — the passage largely reinforces earlier items (Holloway’s assertion of Kira’s freedom, community support, Captain Torres’ eventual acceptance) and records formalization (signed declination) and departure logistics (beacon left, freighter lifts off) that matter for future continuity.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_SIGNED_OFFICIAL_DECLINATION">Kira Voss signed an official declaration formally declining rescue/extraction and choosing to remain with the plant community.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TORRES_LEFT_EMERGENCY_BEACON_AND_CONTACT_INFO">Captain Torres (and the freighter team) left an emergency beacon and contact information with the community, with an explicit offer to return if the beacon is activated.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HARMONY_PROSPECT_DEPARTED_AFTER_VISIT">The freighter Harmony Prospect lifted off and departed the facility after the meeting with Kira, Torres, and Dr. Chen.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_PUBLICLY_CREDITS_KIRA_FOR_ACOUSTIC_DESIGN">Runner publicly attributes the facility's acoustic resonance chambers and the idea of integrating acoustic beauty with function to Kira's suggestion and influence.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage continues immediately from the previous scene (Torres agreed to a tour). Time cues: the freighter previously landed just after dawn (~07:00) and the tour begins right away. The passage covers a guided walkthrough of several facility spaces, short demos (acoustic chamber, visual/olfactory displays), multiple brief conversations (with Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence), a quick re-scan/discussion between Dr. Chen and Torres, signing paperwork, and the freighter's departure. Those activities plausibly take on the order of tens of minutes rather than hours. There is no indication of an overnight or multi-hour gap; the community assembles to see the ship off immediately. Ending cue is the freighter lifting off and the subsequent celebration. Overall timing is plausible: a 20–45 minute tour and administrative wrap-up fits the described events (scans are handheld/brief, paperwork is a single declaration already discussed, and the freighter can reasonably remain on-site for that short window). One minor caveat: if the freighter had a very tight schedule or strict protocol, a longer tour might be unlikely, but the text explicitly allows Torres to inspect and finish paperwork, so the timing as written is consistent.</reasoning>
        <starts>~07:00</starts>
        <ends>~07:30</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation (a few minutes at most). The protagonist leads the visitors straight into a tour and demonstrations after Torres said, "Show me."</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The activities described (short demonstrations, conversational exchanges, quick scans, signing a single declaration, and departure) reasonably fit into a roughly 20–45 minute window. Only a very tight freighter schedule or unusually slow bureaucratic procedures would make this pacing implausible, but the passage supplies the authorial permission for a brief on-site inspection and paperwork, so the timeline holds up.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>The narrator is Kira Voss ("I"), and the passage explicitly names Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Florence, Holloway, and Scout. Torres and Dr. Chen are present in the scene but are not among the provided character cards, so they are noted in the reasoning but not listed in the outputs (only provided character card paths are used). From the previous-present list, Kira_Voss, Scout, and Holloway were already present at the start; Runner, Velvet, Remedy, and Florence arrive/emerge during the passage, so they are classified as ENTERED. No provided-character departs before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The scene takes place at the community/facility on the planet, so the relevant entity from the provided list is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage records a decisive follow-up: Torres and Dr. Chen toured the facility, saw concrete demonstrations of Kira’s integration and positive influence (Runner, Velvet, Remedy, Holloway, Florence, Scout), Dr. Chen reaffirmed Kira’s healthy scans, and Torres accepted that Kira’s choice to stay is voluntary. Torres left an emergency beacon/contact and requested an official signed refusal, which Kira signed; the freighter departed and the community celebrated. I will add these events and consolidate earlier bullets about the freighter visit, the promised tour, and the initial scan into single updated bullets reflecting the outcome. I will keep prior key events (crash, rescue, attack, governance shift, Buddy signal) but compress plant-role details into concise, still-relevant notes.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural‑link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal companion.
          - Hostile plant assault was coordinated and nearly overwhelmed defenders; attackers’ command node was neutralized and its root system removed to prevent contamination.
          - Facility sustained heavy structural and resource damage but core life‑support and medical systems remain functional; key plants are injured or regenerating.
          - Governance shifted after recovery: Holloway acknowledged Florence’s prior deception; Florence was reintegrated and now contributes tactically within a committee‑driven, species‑aware reconstruction process.
          - Plants were repurposed for rebuilding tasks (acoustics/resonance, structural/artistic growth, environmental/chemical work, social curation and mediation).
          - Buddy detected an artificial human emergency signal; the community built a directional antenna integrating key plants and transmitted coordinates and Kira’s status; human freighter Harmony Prospect responded and landed.
          - Captain Torres and Dr. Chen came ashore seeking to extract Kira; Kira publicly refused extraction and declared she would remain with the plant community.
          - Torres and Dr. Chen toured the facility with Kira: Runner demonstrated acoustic resonance chambers, Velvet showed human‑centered architectural spaces shaped by Kira’s input, Remedy showed fragrance/chemical enhancements, and Holloway and Florence testified to Kira’s voluntary integration and positive influence; Scout demonstrated obvious affection for Kira.
          - Dr. Chen reconfirmed Kira’s healthy vitals and psychologically integrated neural patterns during the visit; after private consultation Dr. Chen, Torres accepted that Kira’s choice was voluntary.
          - Torres left an emergency beacon and contact info for future extraction, requested and received Kira’s signed official declaration declining rescue, and Harmony Prospect departed.
          - The community celebrated Kira’s decision; Kira is certain she will remain and identifies the community as home.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV: Kira feels affirmed, calm, and resolute. The passage stages explicit validation — Runner/Velvet/Remedy/Florence testify to her impact, Dr. Chen's scans corroborate her wellbeing, and Torres' conversion from skepticism to acceptance completes the social vindication. Kira's signing of the paperwork and watching the freighter depart with 'No regret. No doubt. Just certainty.' registers a settled, decisive emotional state rather than anxiety or second-guessing. Reader: experiences a warm, cathartic payoff after the long arc of mistrust, isolation, and repair. The scene trades the story's recurring tension/dread beats for closure, belonging, and quiet joy; emotionally it functions as a resolution rather than a repeat. There are echoes of earlier acceptance/belonging beats, but here the repetition feels like earned closure (final acceptance and community integration) rather than redundancy. Overall tone: affirmation → calm resolution → communal celebration.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: Deep validation and belonging when the facility members explicitly credit Kira with reshaping spaces and social practices; Holloway, Florence, Runner, Velvet, and Remedy articulate that she is valued. This is pride-tinged and quietly emotional rather than triumphant — Kira is seen and held. Reader: feels warm satisfaction and emotional relief, recognizing the narrative payoff of Kira's long journey from outsider to integral community member.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, acceptance">POV: Steady, decisive relief and inner certainty as Torres and Dr. Chen confirm Kira is healthy and free to choose; Kira signs the decline-of-rescue paperwork without hesitation and watches the freighter leave with no regret. The emotion is calm and resolved rather than ecstatic. Reader: experiences cathartic closure and reassurance — the anxiety about coercion or forced extraction dissipates into a clear, decisive ending for Kira's choice.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: Quiet joy and communal warmth as the group erupts into celebration (Scout's exuberant bounces), turning Kira's private certainty into shared affirmation. The moment converts personal choice into collective belonging and forward-looking possibility. Reader: uplifted and emotionally buoyed — the finale provides a comforting, hopeful payoff that reframes prior dread into durable connection.</beat>

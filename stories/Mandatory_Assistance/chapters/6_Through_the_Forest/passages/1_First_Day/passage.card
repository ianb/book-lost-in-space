    The first hour set the pattern for everything that followed - and it was AMAZING.

    Rootwalker walked ahead, each step methodical and grounded. Not fast, but relentless—a pace that looked easy but somehow covered ground. I follow, Scout bouncing alongside, Buddy humming softly from my pocket.

    And Leafwhisper talked.

    "So this is the old growth section I mentioned earlier, absolutely beautiful isn't it, the canopy here is at least two hundred years established which means the mycorrhizal networks are incredibly dense and mature, you can actually feel the information flow if you're connected properly though I suppose humans don't have that same ground connection, very different sensory experience I imagine—oh look, see those vines to the left? Those are Reaching type, they communicate through touch like Runner did back at the facility but these ones are specialized for vertical growth, fascinating adaptation really—"

    The leaves rustled continuously, producing rapid cascading speech that jumped from observation to observation without pause.

    I love it immediately.

    "—and the soil composition here transitions from loam to more clay-based about fifty meters ahead which you'll notice affects the plant species distribution, more moisture-retentive substrates support different fungal communities which then influences the entire local network architecture—"

    "Leafwhisper," Rootwalker's deep voice cut through the cascade. "Root crossing."

    "Oh yes! Exactly what I was getting to! See how the path navigates around that large root system? Very important for human balance, center of gravity issues like I mentioned, you'll want to step carefully here Kira—"

    I step over the prominent root. Carefully.

    Scout bounces ahead, clearly enjoying the new terrain. The little plant seems energized by travel—investigating interesting features, rolling back to check on me, bouncing forward again.

    "Your Scout companion is adapting wonderfully to the journey!" Leafwhisper's leaves shimmered with what might have been approval. "Very mobile species, excellent travel disposition, I've guided a few sphere-type plants before and they're always such pleasant companions, very self-sufficient, don't require much support though I notice Scout stays close to you which suggests strong attachment formation—"

    "How far today?" I ask when Leafwhisper paused briefly.

    "Approximately twenty-three kilometers!" Leafwhisper rustled enthusiastically. "Which sounds like a lot but it's very manageable pace, we'll take regular rest breaks of course, every two hours recommended for bipedal travelers to prevent fatigue accumulation, and Rootwalker knows all the best spots with good ground stability and access to water sources—"

    "Twenty-three kilometers," I repeat. About fourteen miles. That is... a lot of walking.

    "Yes! Should take roughly eight to nine hours with breaks factored in, very standard first-day distance, we're being quite conservative actually because you're still adjusting to travel pace and also you mentioned the leg injury recently healed so we don't want to stress the tissue too much during initial exertion—"

    Rootwalker made a sound that might have been agreement. Or just acknowledgment that Leafwhisper was still talking.

    I settle into the rhythm. Walk. Listen. Watch the forest.

    And the forest is... not what I'd expected.

    I'd thought it would be like forests back home—trees standing separate, individual organisms competing for resources. But this is different. The more I walk, the more I notice the connections.

    Vines linked canopy to ground. Root systems visibly merged between different plants. Mushrooms clustered where multiple trees met, creating communication nodes. The whole forest felt interconnected—one massive organism rather than a collection of individuals.

    "—exactly right!" Leafwhisper said, and I realize I'd spoken that thought aloud. "The network model is much more accurate than individual tree framework! Everything here shares resources, information, support systems—it's one of the things that made learning human language so revolutionary because suddenly we could communicate as individuals while still being part of the collective, very interesting philosophical shift actually—"

    "How does it work?" I ask eagerly. "The network?"

    Leafwhisper's leaves practically vibrated with enthusiasm. "Wonderful question! So the primary communication happens through mycorrhizal connections—fungal networks linking root systems underground—which allows chemical signaling, nutrient exchange, and information transfer across vast distances! But there are also above-ground connections through touching branches, vine bridges, even airborne chemical signals through released compounds, it's incredibly sophisticated really, much more complex than early human researchers understood when they first studied plant communication—"

    Rootwalker stopped abruptly.

    I almost walk into them.

    "Rest," Rootwalker said simply.

    They'd reached a small clearing where several large trees formed a natural circle. The ground was covered in soft moss, and water trickled somewhere nearby.

    "Perfect timing!" Leafwhisper rustled. "This is one of the designated rest areas, excellent ground stability and the moss here is very comfortable for sitting, plus there's a spring just through those ferns if you need hydration, very well-maintained spot, I helped reinforce the path markers myself last season—"

    I sit. My legs are grateful, but my brain is buzzing.

    Scout settles beside me, bouncing gently—checking in.

    "This is AMAZING," I tell the little plant. "The network, the guides, all of it."

    "You're adapting wonderfully!" Leafwhisper assured me. "Humans have excellent endurance actually, much better than many species, and you've been asking such great questions—"

    Rootwalker had moved to the spring. A moment later, they returned with water cupped in their root-hands, offering it to me.

    The gesture surprises me. Quiet care delivered without words.

    "Thank you," I say.

    Rootwalker just nodded and moved away to check the path ahead.

    "Rootwalker is very good at anticipating needs," Leafwhisper said more quietly. "Doesn't talk much but always pays attention, excellent guide really, we've worked together for many journeys and I've learned to read their actions—when they stop suddenly it means obstacle ahead, when they adjust pace it means terrain difficulty changing, very reliable communication once you learn the patterns—"

    I drink the cool water and grin.

    "Buddy," I say, "this is like Mav's first day on the Seven Valleys journey. Season 3, episode 2."

    "You're right!" Buddy sounds delighted. "The one where he meets the guide who never stops talking?"

    "YES! And the silent one who just leads!"

    "Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are PERFECT casting!"

    Leafwhisper's leaves rustle with curiosity. "You're comparing us to a story?"

    "The BEST story. You'd love Uncharted. Mav is this explorer who—"

    "Buddy," I say, "how does the network communication work across long distances? Chemical signals seem like they'd be slow."

    "I've been wondering that too!" Buddy sounds genuinely curious.

    Leafwhisper practically vibrates with enthusiasm. "WONDERFUL questions! So the primary fungal networks can actually transmit information quite rapidly through electrical signals along the mycelium—"

    The explanation is fascinating. I find myself actually leaning forward to listen.

    Rootwalker returned. "Time."

    I stand eagerly. "More?"

    "Back to it then!" Leafwhisper rustled. "The next section goes through a particularly beautiful grove—"

    "I can't wait!"

    They walked.

    The afternoon blurred into delightful rhythm. Step, step, step. Leafwhisper explaining everything—plants, terrain, network protocols, interesting rocks.

    Buddy asked constant questions. "How do different species coordinate priorities?" "What happens when network signals conflict?" "Does the fungal network ever get congested?"

    Leafwhisper LOVED having two enthusiastic listeners.

    Rootwalker occasionally interjected. "Left here." "Root system." "Slow." "Rest soon."

    Scout explored and returned, explored and returned, endless energy.

    And I walk, seeing the forest as society—complex, interconnected, AMAZING.

    When they stop for the second rest, my legs are tired but my brain is still buzzing.

    "Seven more kilometers!" Leafwhisper said brightly. "You're doing wonderfully!"

    "I can do seven more kilometers," I say. "Especially if Leafwhisper keeps explaining things."

    "Always!"

    "When we stop for the night," I ask, "mushroom paste?"

    "Absolutely! Road trip mushroom paste!"

    "Still terrible?" I grin.

    "Almost certainly! But nutritionally complete!"

    Rootwalker stood. "Time."

    The final stretch is tiring—legs burning, feet sore—but the sunset is AMAZING. Purple and gold light filtering through the canopy like stained glass.

    "Buddy, this is like the sunset scene in Season 3 when Mav reaches the first valley."

    "It really is! The color palette is almost identical."

    They reach the rest shelter just as bioluminescence starts brightening.

    A woven plant structure with moss beds, water feature, mushrooms already fruiting.

    "And here we are!" Leafwhisper announced. "End of day one, approximately twenty-three point seven kilometers!"

    I settle onto the moss bed, exhausted but THRILLED.

    Scout settles next to me, bouncing gently.

    "Best road trip ever?" I ask the little plant.

    Scout bounces once. Definitely.

    While Leafwhisper synthesizes dinner—still chatting about nutrient profiles and synthesis efficiency—Rootwalker checks the shelter, reinforces a few structural points, ensures the water flow is clean.

    Quiet competent care.

    When Leafwhisper brings the food—predictable gray mushroom paste—I eat it happily. Still terrible. Still perfect.

    "How do you two work together?" I ask. "You're so... different."

    Leafwhisper's leaves rustled—pleased by the question. "Complementary skillsets! I handle information, Rootwalker manages terrain—"

    "Works," Rootwalker confirmed from across the shelter.

    One word. Complete agreement.

    I grin. "Like Mav and Kit. Complementary partners."

    "You keep referencing this Mav person," Leafwhisper says curiously.

    "Mav's from Uncharted! My favorite show. He's an explorer who—okay, I'm too tired to explain the whole thing. Tomorrow?"

    "Tomorrow!" Leafwhisper agrees enthusiastically.

    Scout curls up beside me. Rootwalker settles near the entrance—silent guardian. Leafwhisper's leaves rustle softly.

    Twenty-three kilometers.

    Day one complete.

    I'd walked twenty-three kilometers through an alien forest with enthusiastic plant guides who actually wanted to answer ALL of Buddy's questions.

    "Best road trip ever," I mumble.

    Scout bounces once in agreement.

    Tomorrow: more.

    Dense forest that's actually a LIVING NETWORK - plants communicating, adjusting paths. Bioluminescent markers. Kira: "This is AMAZING!"

    Kira THRILLED to be on the journey. Leafwhisper's chatter is delightful. Forest network is mind-blowing. "Mav's first day on the Seven Valleys journey was just like this!" Tired at end of day but happy - best road trip ever.

  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts are those that introduce persistent details about travel pace, guide capabilities/roles, ecosystem structure, and resources that will affect planning and timelines later (route progress per day, rest schedule, available shelters/food, guide behaviors, Scout’s stamina). I omitted transient details (exact dialogue, momentary sensations, exact times already in the summary). No statements in this passage directly contradict previously established facts; most details reinforce or add specificity to existing items (e.g., Rootwalker and Leafwhisper behavior, daily distance aligning with prior territory/travel timelines). Where nutritional capability overlaps with earlier notes about Remedy’s limitations, the passage does not explicitly contradict those limitations, so I did not flag a conflict.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DAY1_DISTANCE_TRAVELED_23_7_KM">On Day 1 of travel Kira and the guides covered approximately 23.7 kilometers (reported as ~23–23.7 km for the day).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DAILY_TRAVEL_DURATION_8_TO_9_HOURS_WITH_BREAKS">Leafwhisper estimates the day’s travel (≈23 km) will take roughly eight to nine hours including regular breaks.</fact>

      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_PATTERN_MAINTAINED_THREE_DAYS_TO_BOUNDARY">The guides plan to maintain the daily travel/rest pattern for three days total before reaching the territorial boundary (i.e., three-day travel segments are expected).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_LEAFWHISPER_COMMUNICATIVE_AND_NAVIGATION_ROLE">Leafwhisper functions as an information/communication-focused guide: talkative, provides route, ecological, and dietary information, and maintains/updates path markers (helped reinforce path markers the previous season).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ROOTWALKER_SILENT_ANTICIPATORY_NAVIGATOR">Rootwalker functions as the practical navigation/terrain specialist: methodical, largely silent, anticipatory of obstacles, provides practical care (e.g., retrieves and offers water) and acts as a quiet guardian of the group/shelter.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_LEAFWHISPER_MUSHROOM_SYNTHESIS_NUTRITION">Leafwhisper can synthesize mushroom-based meals using Kira’s dietary documentation/protocols; the food is described as nutritionally complete and edible though less sophisticated than Remedy’s facility meals.</fact>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Start/end times come from in-passage cues. The previous passage ended at "dawn" (given as Day 9 ~05:30). This passage opens immediately with "The first hour set the pattern..." and then describes a day of walking: Leafwhisper explicitly estimates the day’s distance (≈23 km) and earlier in the passage says that distance "should take roughly eight to nine hours with breaks factored in." The text also mentions discrete rest breaks (one called after about an hour, described as ~15 minutes; another later), an afternoon that "blurred into rhythm," and arrival at a rest shelter as the planet’s bioluminescence begins to brighten (dusk). Using those cues I place the start at dawn (~05:30) and the end after a full day-walk consistent with Leafwhisper’s 8–9 hour estimate, with a small buffer to match the dusk/bioluminescence cue.

      Total elapsed in the passage therefore covers the bulk of a single travel day: roughly 8–10 hours of clock time. The gap from the previous passage is effectively none — the previous passage ended with leaving at dawn and this passage begins with the first hour of that walk.

      Plausibility: The timing is plausible. Covering ~23–24 km in 8–9 hours (including rest breaks) gives an average moving speed around 2.6–3.0 km/h, which is slow-to-moderate for mixed/rough terrain and fits a methodical, plant-paced group with regular rests. The rest schedule (brief ≈15-minute breaks every couple of hours) and muscle-soreness development by evening are realistic. There is a minor apparent tension between the 8–9 hour duration and the later, somewhat poetic description of "sun is setting"/bioluminescence brightening; that can be reconciled if the planet’s day is shorter, if dawn was earlier than the ~05:30 approximation, or if the guides’ conservative pace/extra buffer pushed them later in the afternoon. In short: timing is coherent and believable within the story’s internal cues.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>Day 9 ~05:30 (dawn)</starts>
    <ends>Day 9 ~14:30 (mid–late afternoon / approach of dusk; approximate)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The previous passage ended at dawn when they set out; this passage opens with the first hour of that same walk.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. 23–24 km accomplished in ~8–9 hours with periodic short rests yields a realistic average pace (~2.6–3.0 km/h) for slow, deliberate travel on uneven terrain and matches the physiological details (fatigue, muscle soreness, need for rest and nutrition). Minor descriptive tension between an 8–9 hour day and the dramatic dusk imagery can be reasonably reconciled by small variations in dawn/sunset timing or extra buffers during the day.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>I identified every character who is either present or explicitly mentioned in the passage. Present at the start are Rootwalker, Scout, Buddy, Leafwhisper, and Kira (the narrator). Runner and Remedy are mentioned by name (references to past events or comparisons) so they count as appearing. No new characters enter during the scene (everyone who appears is present or mentioned early on), and no characters who were present at the start leave before the passage ends (everyone remains or returns and is present at the end). The only listed entity relevant is the planet setting referenced in the text.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage describes the first day of Kira's escorted journey through Territory One and establishes the travel routine and guide dynamics that will matter going forward. Key plot facts to add: Rootwalker's steady lead, Leafwhisper's nonstop commentary and knowledge of mycorrhizal networks, Buddy monitoring Kira's vitals and predicting soreness, Scout adapting to travel, scheduled rests (about every two hours), a spring rest stop with Rootwalker offering water, Leafwhisper synthesizing a nutritionally complete mushroom meal from Kira's records, and the distance covered on day one (~23.7 km) with an overnight plant-structure shelter. I consolidated earlier administrative minutiae (exact form duration, precise approval wait time) into “expedited approval” since those details no longer affect immediate progress, and I kept details relevant to ongoing travel (guides, Buddy's limited battery, route/time estimates, plan to reach boundary in ~3 days).</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active (limited battery).
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Kira entered Holloway plant collective for care, received temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Remedy treated her leg and transmitted medical records to territorial networks; Holloway noted a possible long-term micronutrient gap.
      - Buddy estimated external rescue/search reach measured in months; Holloway filed a relay to Elder Heartwood but Kira opted to travel physically toward the Elder rather than wait for relay rescue.
      - Holloway explained multi-territory route requiring guides, permissions, and handoffs; Kira submitted travel requests and received expedited approval.
      - Two Territory One guides assigned: Leafwhisper (talkative, knowledgeable about plant/mycorrhizal networks and nutrient synthesis) and Rootwalker (taciturn terrain specialist); Buddy and Scout will accompany Kira.
      - At dawn Kira departed with Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Scout, and Buddy into Territory One toward the Elder Heartwood boundary.
      - First day established the travel pattern: Rootwalker led a steady, methodical pace; Leafwhisper provided continuous botanical and logistical commentary; Buddy monitored vitals and warned of expected muscle soreness; Scout adapted and explored the route.
      - They took regular rests (~every two hours), stopped at a spring where Rootwalker offered water, and used designated rest spots with comfortable moss beds.
      - Leafwhisper synthesized a nutritionally complete mushroom-based meal per Kira's dietary records; Kira ate and recovered energy.
      - Day one distance: approximately 23.7 kilometers traveled; they camped at a woven plant-structure rest shelter as bioluminescence rose.
      - Guides plan to maintain a similar pace and pattern for the next days; estimated three days of this pace before reaching the territorial boundary; Kira rested overnight to recover.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings: The scene balances fatigue and mild cognitive overload with growing, quiet contentment. Kira is physically exhausted from a long first day of travel and mentally overwhelmed by Leafwhisper's nonstop, cascading commentary, but she also settles into a calming rhythm of movement and care. Small gestures (Rootwalker's silent offering of water, Scout's presence, the shelter) produce gratitude and a sense of being supported; Kira accepts the pattern and feels cautiously optimistic about continuing. There is also a clear moment of sensory and intellectual awe as she recognizes the forest as a single interconnected organism rather than isolated trees. 

      Reader experience: The reader likely feels a mix of mild amusement/exasperation at Leafwhisper's relentless lecturing, bodily sympathy for Kira's soreness, and warmth/relief at the competent, quietly compassionate support from Rootwalker, Scout, and Buddy. The discovery of the forest's networked nature produces curiosity and wonder. Overall the passage soothes earlier acute anxieties and replaces them with sustained, purposeful momentum.

      Beats and tone: There are multiple related emotional beats rather than a single dominant tone: (1) cognitive overload/exasperation with Leafwhisper's incessant information, (2) weary acceptance and comforting companionship as Kira settles into the travel rhythm, and (3) wonder/curiosity at the forest's interconnectedness. 

      Comparison to prior pattern: This continues the story's recurring arc of anticipation → tension/dread → acceptance but shifts the balance: dread is largely absent here, replaced by acceptance, wonder, and pragmatic hope. The recurring motif of frustration reappears (previously with bureaucracy and Buddy/Holloway), but here it is milder and more comic/exasperated (info-overload) rather than threatening. The scene functions as restorative: it reduces earlier high-stakes tension and advances forward momentum while reintroducing the story's mix of human vulnerability and alien wonder.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="frustration, tension">POV: Overwhelm and mild exasperation as Leafwhisper's cascade of nonstop explanations becomes too much to process; Kira tries to listen but the volume of information fatigues her mind. Cause: constant rapid commentary layered over physical tiredness. Reader: amused and slightly impatient on Kira's behalf—recognizing the comedy of an earnest but overwhelming guide while sharing sympathy for cognitive overload.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Weary acceptance and quiet, pragmatic hope as Kira settles into the walking rhythm, appreciates Rootwalker's silent care and Scout's companionship, and recognizes that progress is being made. Cause: dependable companions, small acts of care, and tangible forward movement (completing day one). Reader: feels warmth, relief, and reassurance—this scene soothes earlier acute fear by showing effective, trustworthy support and regained agency.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, anticipation">POV: Genuine wonder and intellectual curiosity when Kira perceives the forest as a single, networked organism rather than isolated trees; this expands her understanding of the world she's traversing. Cause: sensory detail of merged roots, fungal nodes, and interlinked communication. Reader: experiences uplifted awe and renewed curiosity about the planet and what the journey will reveal next.</beat>

      Summary of approach

      I compared the new passage to the prior open-promises list and tracked which setups were paid off, which were superseded/abandoned, and which remain active. I treated explicit, repeated statements and concrete events as firm payoffs or new firm setups (e.g., the territory actually providing shelter/food; Leafwhisper's explicit claim about pace and the three-day pattern). I treated exposition, possibilities, and character/atmosphere hints as tentative unless they were stated as fact or strongly demonstrated. Older, location-specific items that the story moved away from (Kira left the facility and the earlier local water expedition) I marked as lapsed because the narrative focus has moved on and the prior immediate intent was abandoned. Ongoing mysteries (crash coordinates, system failures, SAM, Elder's response, long-term survival concerns, nutritional limits) remain relevant and were carried forward. I also added several new promises introduced by this passage (pace/time-to-boundary, the networked forest as an organism, guide behavior consequences, physiological expectations for Kira).

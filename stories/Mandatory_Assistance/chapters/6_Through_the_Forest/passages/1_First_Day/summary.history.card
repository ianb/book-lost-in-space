      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>I track the objective, physical facts visible or explicitly stated at the end of the passage. The party has completed day one of travel through Territory One and has stopped at a designated rest shelter: a woven plant structure with moss beds, a water feature (spring), and a small clearing with mushrooms fruiting. Kira is physically present there, having walked ~23.7 km that day; she is lying down on a moss bed, physically fatigued and experiencing normal post-exertion muscle soreness but no medical complications (leg healed, no stress indicators). Leafwhisper is nearby synthesizing dinner and remaining chatty; Rootwalker is positioned near the shelter entrance acting as a silent guard and reinforcing the structure; Scout is curled up beside Kira, tired; Buddy is active in Kira’s pocket, monitoring biometrics and advising. The forest around them is old-growth with dense mycorrhizal networks, visible root and vine connections, and a nearby spring; ambient light is dimming as the planet’s star sets and bioluminescence in the forest is brightening. Food (synthesized mushroom paste) has been produced and consumed. Kira’s packed belongings (data pad, medical documentation, clothes) and the arrangement that territories provide provisioning remain in effect. The facility, Remedy, and Holloway remain behind at the facility; territorial permissions, guide assignment, and provisioning protocols are still active for the onward multi-day route toward the territorial boundary (three days in Territory One before the first boundary).</reasoning>
        <state>End of day one in Territory One: Kira lies on a moss bed inside a woven-plant rest shelter at the forest clearing, physically tired with normal muscle soreness but no medical complications; Scout is curled beside her; Buddy (active in Kira’s pocket) is monitoring vitals; Leafwhisper is nearby synthesizing mushroom-paste dinner and talking; Rootwalker stands guard at the shelter entrance after reinforcing structure and checking the path. The shelter contains moss bedding, a water feature fed by a nearby spring, and fruiting mushrooms; ambient light shows the star setting and increasing bioluminescence. The party has traveled approximately 23.7 kilometers that day along an old-growth section characterized by dense mycorrhizal networks, interlinked roots and vines, and established trail markers. Kira’s packed items (data pad, medical records, clothes) remain with her; territorial provisioning and boundary protocols remain arranged for the continuing multi-day route toward Elder Heartwood. The medical facility and its staff (Remedy, Holloway’s fruiting bodies) are left behind at the forest edge.</state>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          Summary of my read: This passage is a close, low-conflict travel scene that mostly pays off immediate, short-term setup (the guides arriving and performing their roles, the day-one mileage, territory provisioning and maintained rest infrastructure) while leaving all the larger plot mysteries untouched. I marked as FULFILLED the promises from the previous open list that the passage actually concretely realized (guides in active service; Leafwhisper’s exposition; the territories providing shelter/food; and the physical departure/journey being underway). I marked as LAPSED the one item that the character explicitly abandoned by leaving (the facility quarters as an ongoing resource). Everything else from the previous open-promises stays relevant — either because it remains explicitly unresolved (e.g., origin of the crash, SAM’s status, Elder Heartwood response time, long-term medical/food risks, governance questions) or because the passage reinforced it without resolving it (maintenance of paths and shelters, data-sharing across territories, Buddy’s support but unknown limits).

          New threads introduced here are practical and midrange rather than world-shaking: concrete daily distance and endurance baseline (23.7 km), an explicit three-day segment before the first territorial boundary, confirmed on-route provisioning (water, synthesized mushroom compounds) and maintained rest-shelter infrastructure, Rootwalker’s anticipatory protective role, Scout’s observable limits, and the narrative cost of Leafwhisper’s relentless exposition (information overload/miscommunication risk). These are treated as promises to be followed up in later scenes (fatigue consequences, provisioning failures or variability, miscommunications, shelter security, Scout’s endurance).

          <promise id="DAY_ONE_DISTANCE_CONFIRMED__23_7_KM">Day-one mileage (≈23.7 km) is now established as the physical baseline; creates expectations for fatigue, soreness, and conditioning consequences.</promise>
          <promise id="THREE_DAY_SEGMENT_TO_BOUNDARY">Guides state they will maintain this daily pattern for three days before reaching the territorial boundary — a midrange schedule that frames immediate next steps.</promise>
          <promise id="TERRITORIAL_INFRASTRUCTURE_MAINTAINED__REST_SHELTERS_AND_PATHS">Passage confirms maintained rest shelters, path markers and springs are in regular use — implies organization and repeated maintenance that merits further investigation.</promise>
          <promise id="TERRITORY_PROVISIONING_ON_ROUTE__ON_DEMAND_SYNTH_FOOD_AND_WATER">Guides synthesized compatible mushroom compounds from transmitted dietary documentation and provided spring water on route — establishes on-demand provisioning capability (but reliability/limits unknown).</promise>
          <promise id="ROOTWALKER_PREDICTIVE_NAVIGATION_AND_PROTECTION">Rootwalker’s anticipatory, silent guidance and protective checks are now a demonstrated functional role; future obstacles will likely be mediated by this competence (and could be tested).</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_LIMITS_AND_ENDURANCE">Scout’s high energy but visible fatigue tonight creates a new practical constraint — companion endurance and limits are now a narrative variable.</promise>
          <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_CONTINUAL_CHATTER__INFO_OVERLOAD_RISK">Leafwhisper’s relentless explanatory style is now established as both a source of useful exposition and a potential narrative liability (overload, distraction, miscommunication).</promise>
          <promise id="NIGHT_SHELTER_COMPOSITION_AND_SECURITY">Shelters are woven plant-structures with moss beds and fruiting mushrooms; their comfort is confirmed but their security, defenses, and any governance/ritual functions remain to be examined.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selects new, durable character/world facts from the passage that matter beyond this immediate scene: guide personalities and habits, terrain/species classifications, maintenance responsibilities, and travel protocols. Excludes details already in the provided summary (shelter, distance, characters present, that they ate mushroom paste, etc.). No statements in the passage contradict the previously established facts, so no conflicts are reported.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="LEAFWHISPER_CANOPY_AGE">Leafwhisper states the canopy in this old-growth section is at least ~200 years established (gives an approximate age for this forest's mature canopy).</fact>
          <fact id="LEAFWHISPER_SPEECH_CASCADE">Leafwhisper's speaking style for guiding is a rapid, continuous cascade of high-density observations and explanations that can overwhelm a human listener and impede deep processing of information.</fact>
          <fact id="VINE_REACHING_TYPE">There is a classified vine variety called 'Reaching' type that specializes in vertical growth and communicates primarily through touch (analogous to Runner's touch-communication).</fact>
          <fact id="LEAFWHISPER_PATH_MAINTAINER">Leafwhisper actively participates in trail/path maintenance and marker reinforcement (mentions having reinforced path markers the previous season), indicating guides contribute to physical upkeep of travel routes.</fact>
          <fact id="REST_BREAK_RECOMMENDATION">Guides recommend scheduled rest breaks roughly every two hours for bipedal human travelers to prevent fatigue accumulation (a procedural travel guideline used by guides).</fact>
          <fact id="ROOTWALKER_NONVERBAL_SIGNALS_AND_CARE">Rootwalker communicates significant terrain cues nonverbally via movement patterns (e.g., stopping = obstacle ahead; adjusting pace = changing terrain difficulty), anticipates basic needs, and provides silent, practical care (including physically offering water with root-hands).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage begins immediately after the characters set out at dawn. The opening line, “The first hour set the pattern…,” plus repeated references to rest breaks every two hours, an early 15-minute rest, an afternoon that “blurred into rhythm,” and finally the sun setting and bioluminescence brightening all mark a single travel day. Leafwhisper explicitly gives the planned distance for day one (~23 km) and an estimated duration of roughly eight to nine hours (including breaks). The narrative ends with the party reaching a shelter and settling for the night. Put together, the passage covers a full day of travel — from departure at dawn through to evening when they stop for the night. That implies roughly one travel-day elapsed (dawn → evening). There's a small tension: Leafwhisper’s 8–9 hour estimate would place arrival in mid-to-late afternoon if they left at ~06:00, while the prose emphasizes sunset/bioluminescence (later). This can be reconciled by additional rests, slower pace at the end, terrain delays, or a longer local daylight cycle; none of these are implausible. Medical/tiring effects, rest intervals, pace, and distance described are consistent with a human hiking ~23 km over rough terrain with frequent short rests and a slow, methodical guide. No major timing impossibilities appear.</reasoning>
        <starts>≈06:00 (day 9, dawn — immediately after departure)</starts>
        <ends>≈18:00 (day 9, evening — arrival at shelter and nightfall)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation from the previous passage (they set out at dawn and the passage picks up with the first hour of walking).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Walking ~23–24 km in a single day with frequent short rests and a slow, methodical guide is realistic (roughly 8–12 hours depending on terrain and breaks). The minor inconsistency between Leafwhisper’s 8–9 hour estimate and the narrative emphasis on arriving at sunset can be explained by extra stops, slower finishing pace, or local day-length differences, so overall timing works.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I scanned the passage for any named characters or mentions and compared that to the list of characters who were present at the end of the previous passage (taken as the start of this passage). Characters explicitly present or mentioned in the passage: Kira_Voss (narrator “I”), Scout, Buddy, Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Runner (mentioned), and Remedy (mentioned). Runner was not in the previous-present list, so they "entered" the scene in the sense of first appearing in this passage. Holloway, Elder_Heartwood, and Remedy were listed as present at the end of the previous passage but do not appear among the characters present at the end of this passage, so they count as having exited during this scene. The only provided entity relevant to the setting is the Sector_7-Gamma-412 planet (the forest/facility are referenced but not provided as separate entity cards).</reasoning>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I reviewed each open promise from the prior list against events and details in this passage. The passage mostly advances the travel arc (Day One) and richly demonstrates the Leafwhisper/Rootwalker guide dynamic, the mycorrhizal network as a real, active system, and the practical infrastructure of the route (rest areas, shelters, path markers). I treated explicit, repeated details that are clearly shown and likely to matter later as firm promises; softer worldbuilding or implications that could be incidental were marked tentative. Only one previously-open promise was clearly paid off here (the talkative-vs-quiet guide dynamic). Nothing in this passage directly resolves older technical/mission mysteries (bio-samples, coordinates, navigation failure, life-support power, Elder Heartwood response, etc.), so those remain open. I did not mark widely useful worldbuilding facts as lapsed because they remain potentially relevant to the journey and ongoing stakes. New promises introduced by this passage focus on: (a) the mycorrhizal network's speed and reach (explicitly described), (b) Rootwalker's nonverbal signaling as a reliable warning system, (c) the presence of socially-maintained paths and rest infrastructure, and (d) the travel pace established by day one (23+ km) that will shape timeline expectations.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_TALKATIVE_ROOTWALKER_QUIET_DYNAMIC">The earlier setup that Leafwhisper is effusive/talkative and Rootwalker is quiet/terrain-focused is demonstrated fully in Day One: Leafwhisper provides constant exposition while Rootwalker gives short, actionable nonverbal cues.</promise>

          <promise id="PLANTS_MAY_MISINTERPRET_HUMAN_CUSTOMS" tentative="true" introduced="7">Because the plants learned 'Standard' from human materials, their model of human behavior/help may be skewed; their literal/formal processes remain relevant.</promise>
          <promise id="LIVING_FACILITY_BREATHING_ARCHITECTURE" tentative="false" introduced="8">The facility's living, breathing vine architecture (pulsing bioluminescence, soft walls) remains a core environmental factor and continues to shape the world, even as the scene moves into the forest.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_NETWORK_SHARED_CONSCIOUSNESS" tentative="false" introduced="8">The fungal/plant signalling network (pulsing mushrooms, consulted fruiting bodies) remains active and relevant; the passage reinforces an interconnected forest network.</promise>
          <promise id="COLLECTIVE_EMERGENCY_CONTACT" tentative="false" introduced="8">The plants' offer to act as a collective emergency contact remains possible but unused in this scene.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_TREATMENT_EFFECTIVE_6_8_HOURS" tentative="false" introduced="8">Earlier detail about the time-window of Remedy's treatment (6–8 hours) remains unresolved; the passage shows healing but does not confirm that original time-window detail.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage describes the first day of Kira's escorted overland travel with Leafwhisper and Rootwalker. I focused on facts that affect the travel timeline, guides' behaviors/roles, and durable worldbuilding about the forest's communication systems and traveler infrastructure — all of which matter for later logistics, timelines, interactions with guides, and expectations about how the plant collective supports travelers. I did not record transient details (e.g., Kira's momentary feelings, exact dialog) or items already present in the prior fact list (guides assigned, Buddy/Scout accompanying, mushrooms used for food, etc.). No statements in the passage contradict any previously established facts, so no conflicts are flagged.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_COMPLETED_DAY_ONE_23_7_KM">Kira completed day one of the escort journey, covering approximately 23.7 kilometers (about 14 miles) of travel in a single day.</fact>
          <fact id="DAY_ONE_TRAVEL_DURATION_8_TO_9_HOURS_WITH_BREAKS">Leafwhisper estimates the ~23 km first-day distance will take roughly eight to nine hours including regular breaks.</fact>
          <fact id="LEAFWHISPER_RECOMMENDS_REST_BREAKS_EVERY_TWO_HOURS">The plant guide Leafwhisper recommends rest breaks approximately every two hours for bipedal human travelers to prevent fatigue accumulation.</fact>
          <fact id="SHELTER_WOVEN_PLANT_STRUCTURE_MOSS_BEDS_MUSHROOMS_FRUITING">End-of-day rest shelters along the route can be woven plant structures with moss beds, water features, and mushrooms already fruiting for immediate food use/processing.</fact>
          <fact id="ROOTWALKER_OFFERS_WATER_AND_PERFORMS_QUIET_CARE">Rootwalker demonstrates anticipatory, nonverbal caregiving behavior (e.g., cupping and offering spring water), reinforcing their role as a quiet, terrain-focused guide who attends to travelers' needs.</fact>
          <fact id="LEAFWHISPER_MAINTAINS_PATH_MARKERS">Leafwhisper engages in route maintenance (reports reinforcing path markers during prior season), indicating active stewardship of travel routes and ongoing seasonal maintenance work.</fact>
          <fact id="MYCORRHIZAL_NETWORKS_TRANSMIT_ELECTRICAL_AND_CHEMICAL_SIGNALS">Leafwhisper explains that the forest's mycorrhizal/fungal networks enable both chemical signaling and relatively rapid information transfer via electrical signals along mycelium, establishing a concrete mechanism for the plants' long-distance communication.</fact>
          <fact id="BUDDY_CONTINUES_TO_BE_CURIOUS_AND_ASKS_TECHNICAL_QUESTIONS">Buddy accompanies Kira on the walk and actively asks technical questions about plant network behavior and coordination (e.g., signal conflicts, congestion), demonstrating ongoing inquisitive/cataloging behavior during travel.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Temporal cues in the passage: they set out at dawn and the narrator says “the first hour set the pattern.” Leafwhisper gives an estimated day distance ~23 km that “should take roughly eight to nine hours with breaks factored in.” The party takes regular rest breaks every ~2 hours, stops twice (one early clearing, one second rest), and finishes when sunset/bioluminescence begins—explicitly described as “sunset is AMAZING” and “bioluminescence starts brightening,” then “End of day one.” Those cues point to a single daytime travel day that begins at dawn and lasts most of the day.

          The authoritative previous-passage end time provided is 2687-03-22T21:00, so the next dawn is the following morning. I therefore place the start at the dawn of 2687-03-23. To accommodate both Leafwhisper’s 8–9 hour moving estimate and the narrative’s sunset/bioluminescence arrival (a later/evening finish), I assume additional time for frequent explanations, extra pauses, and a relaxed pace, giving a full day of travel that ends near sunset.

          Note on metadata conflict: the previous passage text itself described settling to sleep and then “Dawn arrives… We walk into the forest,” which implies that the previous narrative already included the next-morning dawn. However you instructed to treat the provided outline time (2687-03-22T21:00) as the authoritative end of the previous passage; I used that as the anchor and placed this passage at the following dawn. Also there is a conflicting ‘‘previous passage summary timing’’ (2687-03-24T06:00) in the input, but per instruction I treated 2687-03-22T21:00 as authoritative.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>2687-03-23T06:00</starts>
        <ends>2687-03-23T18:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>09:00 (nine hours). Likely night/sleep and morning preparations between the previous passage end (2687-03-22T21:00) and dawn departure. Note: the narrative also describes dusk-to-dawn movement within the previous passage text, creating an internal timeline inconsistency; I followed the supplied authoritative timestamp.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Covering ~23–24 km in a single day is reasonable with steady walking interspersed by regular rest breaks. Leafwhisper’s estimate of 8–9 hours of walking plus extra time for long explanatory stops, water breaks, and checking route easily stretches to a 10–12 hour day—consistent with a dawn start and sunset/bioluminescence arrival. The ~9-hour gap from the prior passage allows for a normal night’s sleep and morning departure. The only real timing oddity is the input’s internal inconsistency about when the previous passage actually ended (narrative suggests it already reached dawn), but the travel day timeline itself (dawn → multiple rests → evening shelter) is coherent and believable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I read the passage and listed every character who appears or is directly mentioned. Kira is the first-person narrator and is present throughout. Rootwalker, Leafwhisper, Buddy, and Scout are physically present and active in the scene. Runner is mentioned by name as a point of comparison, so they count as mentioned. No other characters from the available list are referenced. No new characters enter during this passage (everyone shown at the start remains present or is referenced throughout), and no character who was present at the start leaves before the passage ends, so ENTERED and EXITED are empty. The passage also references the show/fictional property Uncharted (Mav/Maverick), so I included the provided entity for that reference. I did not include Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet because it is not mentioned in the text.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage describes the first day of Kira's overland journey through Territory One with her assigned guides. Key plot events to add: the travel rhythm/pattern established, the guides' contrasting styles (Leafwhisper talkative and network-explaining; Rootwalker methodical and taciturn), Buddy and Scout's active companionship, confirmation of distance/time covered on day one (~23–23.7 km, ~8–9 hours with regular rests), specific rests (spring water, mossed rest circle), arrival at a plant-woven bioluminescent shelter for the night, and the mushroom-paste dinner. I consolidated some earlier logistical/preparation details into single bullets (travel request approval, guide assignment, departure) to keep the running summary compact while preserving unresolved issues (active Biological Samples container, SAM offline, broken external comms, uncertain Elder Heartwood response) which still matter going forward.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” failed during approach; cargo struck the hull and the shuttle crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew were killed.
          - Shipboard AI SAM is offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and instantiated assistant AI Buddy; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a plant collective (Scout, Holloway, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found Kira, sheltered her, and the shuttle served as temporary shelter.
          - The Biological Samples container remains active, glowing, drawing power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Kira integrated with Scout, Holloway, Remedy (salvage-built humanoid doctor), Buddy and the collective; Remedy treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove (responses take weeks); Holloway explained formal travel protocols and the seven-territory route; Kira completed and submitted the inter‑territorial travel request.
          - The travel request was approved on an expedited timeline; territorial permissions and guide assignments were confirmed and departure was set for dawn; Buddy and Scout would accompany.
          - Two guides were assigned and departed with Kira into Territory One: Leafwhisper (mobile, extremely talkative, mycorrhizal/network specialist) and Rootwalker (quiet, methodical, terrain specialist).
          - Day one established the travel pattern: Rootwalker led with steady, terrain-focused pacing; Leafwhisper provided continuous explanations about plants, soil, and networked mycorrhizal communication; Buddy and Scout stayed actively engaged.
          - Kira learned that the forest operates as a connected network (mycorrhizal fungal links, vine/branch connections, airborne signals); Leafwhisper explained electrical/chemical signaling and network behavior while Buddy asked questions.
          - Guides managed pacing and rests: regular breaks every ~two hours, use of a spring for water (Rootwalker personally offered water), and selection of stable mossed rest sites.
          - First-day distance and timing: roughly 23–23.7 kilometers covered in about eight to nine hours with breaks; Kira’s leg handled the exertion with periodic rests.
          - Night camp: guides led to a woven plant shelter with moss beds, water feature, mushroom fruiting and emerging bioluminescence; Leafwhisper prepared a communal meal (gray mushroom paste) and Rootwalker reinforced shelter and checked water.
          - Buddy continues to record/participate; Scout acts as attached mobile companion. Kira is exhilarated and committed to continuing; departure resumes the next day.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues that still matter: the active Biological Samples container, SAM remaining offline, broken external communications/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood’s response timeline remains uncertain.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV feelings and why: Kira is exhilarated, curious, and comfortably astonished. After the high-stakes trauma and slow rebuilding of trust earlier in the story, this passage emphasizes a sustained emotional upswing: wonder at the forest's social complexity, delight at having intelligible, enthusiastic guides, and a warm, companionable contentment while physically exerted. She also feels pragmatic fatigue and quiet gratitude when Rootwalker offers water and when Scout and Buddy participate; those small caregiving gestures undercut any remaining isolation. Reader experience: the passage invites the reader to share Kira's buoyant immersion — the cadence of walking/explaining, the vividness of network metaphors, and the comedy of Buddy/Mav references produce sustained delight and relief. The dominant tone is joyful wonder mixed with comfortable companionship; there are subsidiary beats of fatigue/relief and quiet determination. Compared to the emotional pattern so far: this continues and consolidates the shift established earlier (from trauma → cautious trust → playful integration). Where earlier chapters moved quickly between dread and tentative hope, this passage stays longer in an upbeat, discovery-driven register that affirms Kira's identity as an explorer and strengthens social bonds. Surprises for the reader: there are no big, structural surprises here — the material mostly elaborates elements already introduced (plant sentience, guides' personalities, networked forest). Small, pleasant confirmations occur (the forest-as-one-organism is shown in more detail; Rootwalker's quiet care is concretely demonstrated), but these are developments rather than unexpected reversals. Character growth or revelations: Several small, clarifying developments occur. Kira deepens her self-conception (she's not just surviving; she is an excited traveler and student of this world). Rootwalker reveals tactile, anticipatory care (quiet but attentive), reinforcing reliability. Leafwhisper reveals and demonstrates the forest's networked sociality and takes on an exuberant teacher role, showing cultural openness to one-on-one explanation. Buddy continues to evolve as an enthusiastic social partner rather than a comic sidekick. Scout's steady closeness reiterates its role as comforting companion. Overall, the passage is a consolidation beat: it cements trust, identity-shift toward explorer/quester, and communal belonging, while delivering sustained wonder and low-stakes emotional joy.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="wonder, joy">Kira experiences sustained, almost childlike amazement at the forest's interconnectivity and at Leafwhisper's nonstop explanations; the narrative voice invites the reader to share in that exhilaration as the unfamiliar environment becomes intelligible and beautiful rather than threatening.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, intimacy">The small caregiving moments — Rootwalker offering cupped water, Scout's constant checking-in, Leafwhisper reinforcing path safety — create warm relief and intimacy for Kira. The reader feels reassured that Kira is genuinely cared for and not alone, converting earlier isolation into dependable companionship.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, hope">Despite physical fatigue after roughly twenty-three kilometers, Kira's eagerness to continue, her enjoyment of the 'road trip' framing, and her steady uptake of knowledge (asking technical questions) communicate renewed stamina and optimism about the journey. The reader shares an energized, forward-looking feeling rather than anxiety.</beat>

        <character-development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="identity-shift">Reinforces and deepens her emerging explorer identity: she moves beyond mere survival to enthusiastic engagement, asking technical questions and happily framing the trip as a pilgrimage/road trip. This consolidates earlier decisions into a stable identity shift toward active questing.</development>
          <development character="Rootwalker" tag="trust-built">Reveals dependable, tacit caregiving—quietly anticipating Kira's needs (fetching and offering water) and signaling obstacles with simple, reliable actions. This underscores Rootwalker's role as a steady, trustworthy guide whose competence is expressed through action rather than words.</development>
          <development character="Leafwhisper" tag="revelation">Shows itself as an exuberant teacher and cultural explainer, willingly translating complex network biology into conversational lessons and social scaffolding for a human traveler.

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I treated this passage as a handoff scene: the Territory One → Territory Two transfer actually happens (so the prior promise about that is paid off). Most earlier plot threads (ship/cargo/medical/power/rescue, long-term research, Elder Heartwood petition, etc.) are not addressed here and remain active. Emotional threads (Kira's attachment to guides, Scout learning, plant-network dynamics) are reinforced rather than resolved, so I carried them forward. I introduced a few new, story-relevant promises tied to Territory Two (the new guides, wetlands/river crossings, and the immediate timing of the first river crossing); one smaller new promise is a tentative emotional/foreshadowing beat (Rootwalker's touch may have future significance). No earlier open promise is explicitly contradicted or made irrelevant here, so I did not mark anything as lapsed except moving the transfer promise to fulfilled.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="TRANSFER_TO_TERRITORY_TWO_NEXT_DAY">Leafwhisper said the party would reach the boundary mid-afternoon and be transferred to Territory Two guides; in this passage the handoff to Streamwalker and Brightbloom occurs as described.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I selected facts that introduce new long-term elements (new named guides, a physical/ritual boundary marker, acceptance of Scout by the next-territory guides, and a notable physical farewell) or that change/clarify ongoing world rules (the measurable length/character of territorial transition zones and the territory-type for Territory Two). I omitted transient emotional descriptions and details already covered in previous facts (timing of handoff, that guides exchange responsibilities, that Kira continues onward). I flagged only a genuine contradiction: earlier canonical territory-type assignments named Territory Two as dense forest and Territory Three as wetlands/rivers, while this passage identifies Territory Two as rivers/wetlands (a clear inconsistency for future navigation/expectation).</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BOUNDARY_PHYSICAL_MARKER">The formal boundary clearing is marked by two massive trees (canopies almost touching) with a spiral pattern of stones and flowering plants laid between them (a deliberate, non-fence boundary marker).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BOUNDARY_TRANSITION_ZONE_LENGTH">Territorial boundaries are gradual transition zones—about one kilometer of blended territory—where different plant coordination networks overlap before the formal boundary marker.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_GUIDES_INTRODUCED">Two Territory Two guides are introduced by name and appearance: Streamwalker (tall, vine-like, deep purple-green; soft, musical voice) and Brightbloom (compact, walking-bush form with bright orange flowers; higher-pitched, cheerful voice).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_TWO_DESCRIBED_AS_RIVERS_AND_WETLANDS">The guides state that Territory Two consists primarily of rivers and wetlands and that their escort will last three days (they describe river/wetland terrain and upcoming river crossings).</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues: The passage opens with "The third morning feels different," and describes waking, breakfast, packing, and beginning a final day of walking to a boundary that Leafwhisper expects to be reached "mid-afternoon" after about fifteen kilometers. The transfer/handoff at the boundary and the subsequent walk into new territory mark the end of the passage. Using the authoritative end time of the previous passage (2687-03-24T20:00), the next morning is the following calendar day.

      Amount of time passing in this passage: a single travel day — morning wake/pack, several hours of walking across a transitional zone, arrival at the boundary mid-afternoon, guide handoff and a short period after (walking into Territory Two). Chronologically this spans a typical daytime period (roughly morning through mid-afternoon).

      Gap from previous passage: The previous passage ended the prior evening (2687-03-24T20:00). The start of this passage is the next morning, so the gap is an overnight rest period during which the characters slept, recovered, and prepared for day three.

      Plausibility: The timing is plausible. Fifteen kilometers over mixed terrain with stops, rest, and a formal handoff is comfortably accomplished in a half-day or slightly longer (typical walking speed 3–5 km/h on easy ground; on mixed/soft terrain allow slower pace). An ~11-hour overnight gap provides reasonable time for sleep and morning routines. The handoff and brief farewell interactions described are realistic to fit into the mid-afternoon arrival and immediate transfer. No significant timing contradictions appear.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>2687-03-25T07:00 (approx morning)</starts>
    <ends>2687-03-25T15:00 (approx mid-afternoon)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About 11 hours (previous passage ended 2687-03-24T20:00 → this passage begins the next morning). Likely overnight rest, sleep, morning routines, packing before setting out.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The overnight gap is appropriate for rest between evening and the next morning. Walking ~15 km with rest stops and a formal handoff is reasonable to reach a boundary by mid-afternoon. The sequence of waking, packing, walking, boundary arrival, brief goodbyes, and continuing into new territory fits comfortably into a single travel day.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters present in the passage: the narrator (Kira Voss) and the traveling party (Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, Scout, Buddy). Two new guides arrive at the boundary (Streamwalker and Brightbloom). Elder Heartwood is mentioned by Leafwhisper and therefore counts as appearing (mentioned). The characters who enter during the scene are the two Territory Two guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom) — they are explicitly waiting in the clearing and meet the group. The characters who exit are the Territory One guides (Leafwhisper and Rootwalker), who turn back and disappear into the trees before the passage ends. No entity cards from the provided entity list are explicitly referenced in the passage, so the ENTITIES list is empty.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage describes a boundary handoff between Territory One guides (Leafwhisper and Rootwalker) and Territory Two guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom). Important plot events to add: reaching the territorial boundary, the formal guide transfer, Rootwalker's physical farewell, Scout remaining with Kira, and Kira continuing into Territory Two (rivers/wetlands) with new guides while feeling emotional. I consolidated earlier day-by-day travel detail into a single bullet about establishing rhythm and major lessons (governance, networks, interspecies cognition) to keep the summary compact. I retained unresolved technical issues (Biological Samples, SAM, comms, Elder Heartwood) since they remain relevant.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
      - Shipboard AI SAM is offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
      - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (including Scout, Holloway, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle served as temporary shelter.
      - The Biological Samples container remains active, glowing, drawing power, and cannot be shut down.
      - Kira integrated with the plant collective and Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor); Remedy treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week.
      - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for formal permissions; Elder response is pending and may take weeks.
      - Kira’s inter‑territorial travel request was approved; departure was set for dawn with Buddy and Scout accompanying.
      - Two Territory One guides (Leafwhisper: talkative mycorrhizal/network specialist; Rootwalker: quiet terrain specialist) guided Kira into Territory One.
      - During the first two days Kira established a travel rhythm (wake, eat, walk, rest), covered long distances daily, and learned major conceptual details about plant society: Consensus Groves, extensive root/fungal networks for resource/information sharing, merged organism structures, and a spectrum of inter‑species cognition (including Spiral-type non-linear perception).
      - On the third morning Kira and the Territory One guides approached the boundary to Territory Two through a gradual transition zone of overlapping network coordination.
      - They reached a marked boundary clearing (two large trees and a spiral stone/flower pattern) where two Territory Two guides were waiting: Streamwalker (vine-like) and Brightbloom (compact, flowered bush).
      - Streamwalker and Brightbloom had reviewed Kira’s documentation and briefed her: Territory Two is primarily rivers and wetlands with softer ground and water-based navigation challenges.
      - Leafwhisper and Rootwalker performed the standard handoff, confirmed conditions, transferred responsibility to Streamwalker and Brightbloom, and departed back into Territory One.
      - Rootwalker made a physical farewell—touching Kira’s shoulder briefly—while Leafwhisper offered an emotional goodbye; Scout chose to remain with Kira and continue traveling.
      - Buddy monitored Kira’s emotional/physiological state during the separation; Kira proceeded into Territory Two with Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Scout, and Buddy.
      - Outstanding unresolved issues that still matter: the active Biological Samples container, SAM remaining offline, broken external communications/distress beacon, and Elder Heartwood’s pending response.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV (Kira) experiences a quietly intense farewell: tightness in the chest, tears threatened, and a sense of being unmoored as she hands off trusted guides and steps into the next leg of the journey. The scene mixes sadness at separation with steady acceptance and renewed resolve—Kira is sad because the connections were real, but she consciously chooses to continue. The reader feels warm poignancy and gentle bittersweetness rather than high drama; there is relief that transitions are procedural and humane, and a tender emotional sting at the goodbye. There are multiple emotional beats layered here (intimate farewell, stabilizing readiness, a small surprising tenderness), not a single dominant tone: intimacy/longing is strongest, followed by acceptance/determination and a flash of vulnerability. Compared with the story so far, this continues the arc from isolation → trust → integration: instead of acute trauma or elation, the passage focuses on relational consequences of that integration (attachment and separation). The only real surprise is Rootwalker's brief physical touch—a reserved character showing deliberate tenderness— which registers emotionally because it contrasts with Rootwalker's usual quiet competence. Character-wise, Kira reiterates her decision-identity as an active traveler (she accepts the next guides and keeps going) while Rootwalker and Scout each reveal/confirm deeper relational commitments (Rootwalker by physical contact; Scout by choosing to continue). Overall the passage is about the cost and value of temporary bonds and the emotional maturity of moving forward despite attachment.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="intimacy, longing">Kira's primary emotional response is bittersweet attachment: the tightness in her chest, the near-tears, and the need to thank the guides signal real sorrow at leaving. This beat is driven by genuine connection (not obligation) formed over the journey; the reader experiences warm poignancy and a tender ache, empathetically sharing the loss of a found family.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, determination">After the goodbye moment, Kira steadies herself and affirms she's ready to continue. The farewell resolves into pragmatic acceptance and renewed resolve to keep going toward Elder Heartwood. The reader shifts from melancholic sympathy to a calm forward momentum—comforted that she can carry what she learned onward.</beat>
      <beat tags="vulnerability, intimacy">A focused, emotionally charged beat occurs when Rootwalker unexpectedly touches Kira's shoulder. The quiet guide's gentle, two-second contact exposes both characters' vulnerability and deepens trust. The POV feels exposed and moved; the reader is surprised and emotionally moved by this understated, intimate gesture.</beat>
    </beats>
    <surprises>
      <surprise tags="character">Rootwalker—previously established as taciturn and action-oriented—makes a deliberate, physical gesture of affection (touching Kira's shoulder). That restrained guide expressing tenderness is unexpected relative to their prior quiet competence and therefore registers as a character surprise.</surprise>
    </surprises>
    <character-development>
      <development character="Kira Voss" tag="decision">Reaffirms her decision-identity by accepting the handoff and choosing to continue despite the emotional cost; acknowledges attachment but prioritizes the journey forward.</development>

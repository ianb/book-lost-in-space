  <facts>
    <reasoning>The passage documents a routine territory handoff and introduces new long-term elements (new guides, territory character, physical boundary marker, and a measurable transition zone) that will affect upcoming travel and interactions. It also confirms emotional/physical behaviors of guides (Rootwalker's tactile farewell) and Scout's continued accompaniment — all relevant for continuity. No statements contradict previously established facts about guides, timing, or travel pacing.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DISTANCE_TO_BOUNDARY_15_KM">The group is about fifteen kilometers from the Territory One/Two boundary at the start of the day; expected arrival mid-afternoon.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRANSITION_ZONE_APPROX_1_KM">Territorial boundaries form gradual transition zones roughly one kilometer wide where coordination/communication systems overlap rather than a sharp line.</fact>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>This passage is a single continuous segment covering the last day of the Territory One crossing: the narrator wakes on the third morning, walks toward the boundary, completes the handoff to new guides in a clearing, and then immediately continues into Territory Two. Time cues: "The third morning feels different" marks the start; Leafwhisper’s earlier note—"About fifteen kilometers to the boundary! Should reach it mid-afternoon"—sets the expected arrival. The handoff and emotional goodbye take place at the boundary clearing and are brief (minutes), and the passage ends when the narrator and the new guides set off into Territory Two. Total on-screen time is one morning through mid-afternoon (several hours). Since the previous passage ended the prior evening (~18:00), the gap is an overnight rest (roughly a dozen hours). The pacing is plausible: waking, breakfast/packing, ~15 km of walking with rest stops and a short handoff fits within a morning-to-mid-afternoon window, and the farewell rituals described are short enough to fit into the same afternoon without awkward compression of events.</reasoning>
    <starts>morning (~07:30)</starts>
    <ends>mid-afternoon (~15:00)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈12–14 hours (overnight rest between the previous evening ~18:00 and the next morning). During this gap the group slept, ate, packed, and prepared for the final day—standard overnight activities.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (wake, breakfast/pack, ~15 km walking with intermittent rest, brief boundary handoff, then continuing into new territory) reasonably fits a morning-to-mid-afternoon span. The emotional goodbye and documentation/transfer described would take only minutes to perhaps half an hour, so there is no unrealistic compression. No major timing inconsistencies detected.</plausibility>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage is a boundary/hand-off scene: Kira completes the last day with Territory One guides and transfers to Territory Two. Key events to add: final morning, crossing the transition zone, arrival at a non-physical boundary clearing marked by two trees and a spiral pattern, meeting new guides Streamwalker and Brightbloom, formal handoff and documentation review, Leafwhisper and Rootwalker depart, small physical farewell (Leafwhisper touch; Rootwalker touches Kira's shoulder), Buddy notes emotional distress, Scout remains with Kira, and the party sets out into wetlands with an expected river crossing in a couple hours. Previous logistical detail about daily distances and multiple rest shelters can be consolidated into a single bullet about establishing travel rhythm and adaptations. Remove overly specific distances/daily stats and some repetitive praise lines; keep facts relevant to ongoing plot (who is guiding Kira now, her emotional state, immediate next terrain and timeline).</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active with limited battery.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Kira entered the Holloway plant collective for care, received temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Remedy treated her leg, transmitted medical records, and Holloway noted a possible long-term micronutrient gap.
      - Buddy estimated external rescue/search reach measured in months; Holloway filed a relay but Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait.
      - Two Territory One guides assigned—Leafwhisper (talkative, plant-network specialist) and Rootwalker (taciturn, terrain specialist)—and Buddy plus Scout accompanied Kira on the trek.
      - They established a steady multi-day travel rhythm with regular rests and mushroom-based field meals; Scout explored and returned sensory data; Buddy monitored Kira's vitals and adaptation to long-distance walking.
      - Along the route Kira learned about interconnected plant societies and networked root/fungal communication (including spiral vines and territorial coordination protocols).
      - On the third morning they approached the Territory One/Two transition zone (~15 km to boundary earlier), noted gradual ecological/soil/network changes, and reached the boundary clearing marked by two massive trees and a spiral stone/flower pattern.
      - Territory Two guides Streamwalker (vine-like) and Brightbloom (bushy, flowered) met them, had reviewed Kira's documentation, and assumed guide responsibility for the next segment (three days, rivers/wetlands terrain).
      - Leafwhisper and Rootwalker performed the formal handoff, said goodbye, and departed back into Territory One; Kira had an emotional farewell (touched Leafwhisper; Rootwalker briefly touched her shoulder).
      - Buddy registered Kira's emotional distress and monitored vitals; Scout remained with Kira and was permitted to continue with the new guides.
      - Kira and the new guides entered Territory Two toward wetlands and an expected river crossing in about two hours, continuing the journey toward the Elder Heartwood.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV emotional state: The passage is dominated by a bittersweet, tender farewell. Kira feels attachment, gratitude, and quiet grief at leaving guides who have become a caring, reliable presence; she is moved by small gestures (Rootwalker's touch, Leafwhisper's chatter) and not fully ready to let go. Those feelings quickly segue into pragmatic acceptance and steady resolve — she acknowledges the handoff, thanks them, and steels herself to continue. Finally, there's a calm anticipatory optimism as she follows new guides into unfamiliar wetlands, carrying lessons and a renewed sense of agency.

      Reader experience: The reader is likely to feel warmth and empathy (for the genuine connections Kira formed), a soft sting of sadness at the goodbye, and then uplift/interest as the journey recommences. The scene produces a comforting emotional cadence: attachment → poignant parting → hopeful continuation.

      Multiple beats or dominant tone: There are three interlinked beats — (1) bittersweet attachment/grief at parting, (2) tender gratitude and acceptance of the handoff, and (3) forward-facing anticipation and hope. The dominant emotional arc moves from belonging/loss into acceptance and optimistic momentum.

      Comparison to prior pattern: This continues the story’s recurring motif of temporary, meaningful connections with guides (belonging) and the recurring arc of attachment → separation → acceptance. However, it reduces earlier tension/dread and bureaucratic frustration, favoring intimacy and emotional closure. While the temporary-team/farewell motif recurs across chapters, this passage deepens the emotional stakes (small physical contact, explicit praise) rather than repeating the same tone mechanically, so it feels like an emotional progression rather than mere repetition.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="belonging, grief">Bittersweet farewell and attachment. POV: Kira feels unexpected sadness and tightness in her chest as she says goodbye to Leafwhisper and Rootwalker—their steady care, Rootwalker's touching of her shoulder, and their praise make the parting emotionally charged. Reader: experiences warm empathy and a soft pang of sadness at the genuine connection being severed.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">Gratitude and quiet acceptance. POV: After the initial sting, Kira expresses thanks, touches Leafwhisper, and verbally acknowledges what she learned—she accepts the protocol and the handoff even while mourning it. Reader: feels tenderness and relief that Kira both recognizes the value of the guides and is able to let them go with gratitude rather than resentment.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">Resolute forward motion and cautious optimism. POV: Kira steels herself to continue into Territory Two, carrying rhythm, trust, and lessons learned; she is ready (if a little unmoored) for new terrain and new guides. Reader: experiences uplifted engagement and curiosity—hopeful anticipation for the next leg of the journey and assurance that Kira retains agency.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      This passage completes the Territory One arc: the guides hand Kira off at the boundary, the emotional goodbye plays out, and Kira begins travel with Territory Two guides. I treated as "fulfilled" the prior promises specifically about the three-day pace, the handoff/departure, the emotional struggle at parting, and the day-three conditioning claim because the passage explicitly demonstrates each. I did not mark broader, ongoing mysteries or structural worldbuilding (crash coordinates, navigation failure, SAM, shuttle status, long-term survival, inter-territorial bureaucracy, vitamin/Remedy constraints, etc.) as lapsed — they remain unresolved and still narratively relevant. Several worldbuilding/tactical items from the passage are reinforced and carried forward (forest-as-network, guide personality dynamics, Scout bonding, forest rhythm affecting emotion); I left those open. New, actionable promises were introduced around the new guides, the River/Wetlands terrain and near-term river crossing, the welcoming of Scout into the new guide team, and the visually/ritually marked boundary clearing — these set up short-term beats to be paid off later (river crossing, new guide dynamics, Scout’s ongoing presence), and one tentative hook (boundary marker significance) that could be explored later or remain atmospheric.

      Decisions of note:
      - Fulfilled: I limited fulfilled promises to items explicitly resolved in this passage and which were present in the previous open-promises list: three-day timetable, the guides leaving after transfer, Kira’s attachment/conflict at parting, and Leafwhisper’s claim that conditioning would improve by day three.
      - Open / carried forward: I preserved core mysteries (crash/co-ordinates/navigation/SAM), survival and provisioning concerns, bureaucratic/coordination hooks (Florence, territorial permissions), and many tentative worldbuilding hooks because they remain relevant to future plot and world exploration.
      - Lapsed: I found no strong candidates to lapse here — nothing is contradicted or explicitly abandoned; the passage reinforces rather than drops prior hooks.

      If you want, I can next mark which of the remaining open promises are highest-priority for payoff in the short term (next few passages) versus long-term arcs.

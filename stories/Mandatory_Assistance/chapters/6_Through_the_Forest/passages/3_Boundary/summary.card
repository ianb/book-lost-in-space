  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>This passage describes the morning after the day-two rest and the formal guide handoff at a territorial boundary. Physically, Kira and her companions have packed up and are starting to walk; Kira's muscles are adapted enough to continue, and Buddy (a monitoring device) is active and noting her vitals. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker have escorted Kira to a marked clearing that serves as the Territory One/Two boundary: two massive trees with nearly-touching canopies and a spiral of stones and flowering plants on the ground. Two new guides, Streamwalker (vine-like) and Brightbloom (bushy, orange-flowered), are standing in the clearing and have accepted responsibility. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker physically depart back into Territory One (Rootwalker touched Kira's shoulder before leaving). Scout, the small bouncing plant companion, remains with Kira and is at her side. The environment at the boundary shows a gradual transition in ecology: altered mosses, different soil composition, changed light and bird-equivalent calls; the path ahead softens toward rivers and wetlands. Streamwalker warns of a first river crossing in about two hours, so the immediate route includes softer ground and imminent water crossings. No injuries or lost gear are reported; provisioning and documentation were reviewed. The mood is emotional but Kira is medically stable. Weather/time is morning; bioluminescence is not relevant now.</reasoning>
    <state>Morning at the Territory One/Two boundary clearing. Kira, packed and physically adapted to walking, is walking with new guides Streamwalker (vine-like) and Brightbloom (bushy, orange-flowered); Scout the bouncing plant-sphere is beside her; Buddy continues to monitor vitals. The clearing is marked by two massive trees with nearly touching canopies and a spiral of stones and flowering plants on the ground. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker have completed the handoff and have turned back into Territory One (Rootwalker touched Kira’s shoulder before departing). The terrain ahead transitions to softer soil and wetlands; bird-like calls and different mosses/soil indicate the ecological boundary. The party expects the first river crossing in roughly two hours. No new injuries or missing equipment; travel continues into Territory Two.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage completes the Territory One -&gt; Territory Two handoff and stages an emotionally-significant goodbye, but otherwise advances very little on the larger technical/mystery threads. The single clear payoff from the previous open-promises list is the scheduled guide transfer: the handoff occurs on-time and Rootwalker/Leafwhisper depart. Most prior uncertainties remain active—SAM/Buddy status, shuttle causes, beacon/communications, contamination, long-term survival planning, plant intent, governance, nutrient risks, etc.—because nothing in this scene addresses them. The passage does introduce new, narrower setups that will likely matter soon: the arrival of named Territory Two guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom) with their own styles and reputation, an explicit imminent river/wetland crossing (a concrete terrain hazard coming up in hours), a visually prominent spiral boundary marker (could be symbolic or functional), and an explicit mention that coordination documentation spoke highly of Kira (which reinforces previous threads about unusual attention/expedited processing). The emotional attachment of goodbyes is emphasized as a narrative cost and potential future vulnerability. I mark only the guide-handoff promise as fulfilled; no prior open promise is clearly abandoned or rendered moot in this passage.</reasoning>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage establishes several durable, character- and world-defining details that will matter in later scenes: the physical and procedural nature of territorial boundaries (a gradual ~1 km transition sensed via plant root/fungal links and distinct communication frequencies), the personalities and competence of the new guides (Streamwalker and Brightbloom) and their prior working relationship with Leafwhisper/Rootwalker, explicit acceptance of Scout by Territory Two guides, and a specific, memorable physical farewell (Rootwalker's two-second touch and the phrase 'Good human' as a significant compliment). These facts affect future travel interactions, how territory shifts are perceived/communicated, who can sense what, continuity of guide relationships, and Kira's emotional bonds to guides. I found no contradictions with previously established facts—this passage develops and fills in procedural/mechanistic detail consistent with the earlier world-building.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="TERRITORIAL_TRANSITION_ZONE_APPROX_1KM">Territorial boundaries are gradual transition zones about one kilometer wide where different territories' coordination systems overlap before reaching the formal boundary marker.</fact>
      <fact id="TERRITORY_DISTINCT_COMM_FREQS_AND_RESOURCE_ALGORITHMS">Each territory maintains distinct communication frequencies and resource-sharing algorithms as part of its coordination network; plants detect territory shifts by sensing changes in these coordination patterns.</fact>
      <fact id="TERRITORIAL_SHIFT_SENSED_VIA_GROUND_LINKS_ONLY">Humans who lack a ground/fungal connection typically cannot directly sense the territorial shift; the shift is primarily perceived by plants when connected through roots or fungal links.</fact>
      <fact id="STREAMWALKER_PERSONALITY_VOICE">Streamwalker is a vine-like guide with graceful movements and a soft, almost musical speaking voice (distinctive personality trait).</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_PERSONALITY_VOICE">Brightbloom is a compact, bushy guide with bright orange flowers and a high-pitched, cheerful voice/personality.</fact>
      <fact id="BRIGHTBLOOM_AND_STREAMWALKER_HAVE_GUIDED_SPHERES">Streamwalker and Brightbloom have prior experience guiding sphere-type companions (like Scout) and welcome Scout to continue accompanying Kira.</fact>
      <fact id="ROOTWALKER_TOUCH_DURATION_2_SECONDS">Rootwalker reached out and touched Kira's shoulder and maintained contact for exactly two seconds during the farewell.</fact>
      <fact id="ROOTWALKER_PRAISE_PHRASE">Rootwalker uses the phrase 'Good human' as a meaningful/high praise expression.</fact>
      <fact id="STREAMWALKER_BRIGHTBLOOM_REVIEWED_DOCUMENTATION">Streamwalker and Brightbloom reviewed Kira's travel documentation (dietary requirements, rest needs, human specifications) prior to the handoff and were prepared to assume guiding responsibility.</fact>
      <fact id="INTERGUIDE_HISTORY_WITH_LEAFWHISPER_ROOTWALKER">Streamwalker and Brightbloom have worked boundary transfers with Leafwhisper and Rootwalker for years, indicating an established, cooperative history between these guide pairs.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the passage: it opens "The third morning feels different," and later Leafwhisper says "About fifteen kilometers to the boundary!" and "Should reach it mid-afternoon." The passage proceeds through a morning of packing and walking, a gradual territorial transition, arrival at the boundary in the mid‑afternoon, a handoff and farewell, then the protagonist and new guides set off into Territory Two (Brightbloom notes "about two hours before the first river crossing").

      How much time passes in the passage: a full travel day — morning departure, several hours of walking with commentary and a rest/transfer at the boundary, then the immediate start of the next leg. The expected timeline (start in the morning, reach boundary mid‑afternoon) implies multiple hours of walking (roughly 6–8 hours).

      When it ends: shortly after the handoff and the new guides begin walking into Territory Two. The passage does not include the first river crossing; it ends as they set out and the protagonist commits to the next leg.

      Gap since previous passage: the previous passage ends in the evening (~18:00). This passage begins the next morning, implying an overnight gap (sleep, breakfast, packing). That gap and the amount of daytime walking described align with the narrative details.

      Minor internal note: Leafwhisper’s initial "About fifteen kilometers to the boundary!" and the later arrival at the boundary in the same passage are consistent if the passage covers the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon. There is no implausible compression of travel time given typical walking speeds and the explicitly stated expectation to reach mid‑afternoon.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>~08:00 (next morning — the third morning of the crossing)</starts>
    <ends>~15:00 (mid‑afternoon, after the boundary handoff and as the new guides lead the protagonist into Territory Two)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈13–14 hours (previous passage ended ~18:00 the night before; overnight rest, morning routine and packing before departure)</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. An overnight gap between passages accounts for sleep, breakfast and packing. Walking ~15 km between morning and mid‑afternoon is reasonable with rest stops and slower travel through unfamiliar/soft terrain; the boundary handoff and short farewell are plausible within that timeframe. The subsequent two‑hour estimate to the first river crossing (given by Brightbloom) is consistent with the new guides beginning the next leg shortly after the handoff.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I compared the characters listed as present at the end of the previous passage with who appears or is mentioned in this passage. Characters explicitly named or who speak/are touched/are addressed in the passage are included as present. Streamwalker and Brightbloom are new arrivals at the boundary (they weren't in the previous-present list), so they 'enter' during the scene. Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are present at the start (from the previous-present list) and are shown turning back and disappearing into the trees, so they 'exit' before the passage ends. Elder_Heartwood is only mentioned (not present), so they're included in Present as a mention. Holloway was in the previous-present list but is not mentioned in this passage, so I did not include them as present or as having exited. No entity path from the provided entity list is explicitly referenced in the passage, so the Entities list is left empty.</reasoning>

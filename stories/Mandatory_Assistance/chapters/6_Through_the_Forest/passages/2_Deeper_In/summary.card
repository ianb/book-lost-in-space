  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts are those that add long-term continuity or worldbuilding that could matter later: travel progress and schedule, ongoing changes in Kira's physical conditioning and Scout's adaptation, ecological/phenomenological details about the forest (new dominant species, fused trunks), and a newly named/characterized plant type with a distinctive cognition (Spiral-types with layered time perception). Nothing in the passage contradicts previously established facts; this is a forward movement of the travel timeline and deeper description of the flora and companions' states.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DAY10_DISTANCE_TRAVELED_20_KM">On Day 10 the party covered approximately twenty kilometers during the travel day (the passage confirms 'twenty kilometers. Done.').</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_ONE_BOUNDARY_TOMORROW_TRANSFER">Tomorrow is the last day in Territory One; Kira will be transferred to Territory Two guides mid‑afternoon and Leafwhisper and Rootwalker will return home after the handoff.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_ADAPTATION_IMPROVED">Scout continues to adapt to travel—remains curious, explores ahead, returns with chemical signatures, and is showing less fatigue than on Day 1.</fact>
      <fact id="SPIRAL_TYPE_SPECIES_TIME_LAYERS">A distinct local plant type called 'Spiral-types' exists; they process information via rotational growth patterns and reportedly perceive time as concurrent layers rather than linear sequences, making communication with them disorienting but giving them strong long-timescale pattern recognition.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FOREST_DEEP_SECTION_SPECIES_SHIFT">Farther along the route the forest changes: canopy becomes denser, different species dominate (including fused-trunk living arches with merged root systems), and new mobile/flowering plant types appear.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_TRAVEL_STAMINA_IMPROVING">Kira's bodily adaptation to long-distance walking is progressing: initial soreness eases with movement, she finds a rhythm, and her stamina/efficiency on multi-hour travel is improving.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Cues in the text establish a clear overnight break and a single travel day. The passage opens with "I wake sore" and Leafwhisper's immediate "Good morning!", which mark the start as the morning after the previous passage's sleep. Morning routines described (water, mushroom-paste breakfast, brief conversation) occupy perhaps 30–60 minutes before they set out. The party then walks through the day with periodic rests and a mid/late-day rest stop; the narrator explicitly says the day is "only about twenty kilometers" and later: "When they reached the second rest shelter that evening, I feel tired but strong. Twenty kilometers. Done." That anchors the end of the passage to evening of the same day.

      Estimated durations: 20 km walked at the same steady guided pace (comparable to the prior day's 23 km that was described as 8–9 hours including breaks) plausibly requires roughly 6–9 hours on the trail depending on break length and pace; the passage mentions regular rests and a midday rest, so ~7–9 hours of travel plus morning prep and evening wind-down fits. The gap since the previous passage is an overnight sleep period (evening activities, sleep, morning recovery). The previous passage ended with "Tonight, I sleep," so the time between passages is the intervening night — roughly 12–18 hours depending on when "night" began.

      Minor note on the provided previous-summary time: the summary lists Day 9 ~14:30 which seems inconsistent with the narrative description of dusk/bioluminescence and "Tonight, I sleep." If the previous passage actually ended later (early evening), the overnight gap is shorter; either way, the narrative implies a single night of sleep between passages.

      Overall: start = next morning after sleeping; end = that same day's evening at the second shelter after completing ~20 km; gap = an overnight period; timing is generally plausible given described pace, breaks, and recovery.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>Day 10 ~07:00 (morning)</starts>
    <ends>Day 10 ~18:00 (evening)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~12–18 hours (overnight: evening arrived, shelter and sleep, then morning wakeup, breakfast and prep)</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Waking the morning after the previous passage and walking ~20 km in one day with regular rests fits the established pace and the earlier day's 23 km (8–9 hours with breaks). The described morning routine, mid-day rest, and arrival at a second shelter by evening are consistent. The only minor inconsistency is the previous-summary timestamp (Day 9 ~14:30) versus the narrative's dusk/bioluminescence and sleeping—this likely reflects an approximate timestamp, but it does not make the overnight gap or the day’s travel implausible.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I identified every character who is either present or mentioned in the passage. Present: the narrator (I) is the protagonist Kira_Voss; Buddy speaks at the start; Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are with the group throughout; Scout is active and exploring; Holloway is explicitly mentioned as an example back at the facility. No other named characters from the provided list are referenced. "Entered" should list characters who arrive during this passage but weren’t present at the start — none fit that criterion (Rootwalker "appeared with water" but was already present at the end of the previous passage). "Exited" should list characters who were present at the start and leave before the passage ends — no departures are described. The only available entity from the provided list that could reasonably apply to the scene is the planet/location card; the passage refers to territories and a facility but the only matching entity path supplied is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so I include that as the relevant entity.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>Added events from the current passage: Kira's soreness and recovery during day two, the shortened ~20 km day, Rootwalker providing water/food, Buddy's ongoing monitoring, Scout's exploratory behavior, observations about Spiral-type plants and plant-networked society, completion of day two at a second rest shelter, and that tomorrow is the last day in Territory One with a planned transfer to Territory Two guides and the two guides returning home. Consolidated/updated earlier material: removed the prior three-day crossing estimate and replaced it with the new timeline (transfer tomorrow); kept essential survival and travel facts (crash, Holloway care, guides assigned, Buddy/Scout accompanying, day-one distance and camp). Removed mostly atmospheric detail and repetitive dialogue while preserving plot-relevant developments and character actions.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active (limited battery).
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Kira entered Holloway plant collective for care, received temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Remedy treated her leg and transmitted medical records; Holloway noted a possible long-term micronutrient gap.
      - Buddy estimated external rescue/search reach measured in months; Holloway filed a relay but Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for relay rescue.
      - Two Territory One guides assigned: Leafwhisper (talkative, plant-network specialist) and Rootwalker (taciturn terrain specialist); Buddy and Scout accompany Kira.
      - Dawn departure established a steady pace with regular rests; Leafwhisper synthesized mushroom-based meals for nutrition; day one distance ~23.7 km and they camped in a woven plant shelter.
      - Day two: Kira woke sore but movement eased; guides shortened the day to ~20 km; Rootwalker provided water and mushroom paste; Buddy monitored vitals and commented on muscle adaptation.
      - Deeper forest ecology observed: Spiral-type vines encountered (noted to process information via rotational growth and perceive time non-linearly); Leafwhisper explained that many plants share resources/information through merged root and fungal networks, giving rise to complex plant societies.
      - Scout continued to explore and return chemical/ sensory data; Kira adapted to the travel rhythm and bonded with the guides and Scout.
      - They reached the second rest shelter after ~20 km; Leafwhisper announced tomorrow will be the last day in Territory One, Kira will be transferred mid-afternoon to Territory Two guides, and Leafwhisper and Rootwalker will return home.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: The passage emphasizes quiet recovery, growing physical competence, and emotional attachment. Kira wakes sore and initially resigned to the pain, then experiences relief as movement makes the soreness fade and her body remembers the rhythm. Simultaneously, intellectual/affective wonder at the forest and its radically different cognition fills her with curiosity and enlargement of perspective. Finally a soft feeling of belonging and bittersweet attachment emerges as she recognizes the guides as a found family and feels a pang at the thought of leaving. The reader rides this gentle, domestic arc: from small worry about recovery into comfort/relief, then sensory wonder, and lastly warm, slightly sad affection. There are multiple beats (physical adaptation → wonder/learning → belonging/bittersweetness) rather than one dominant tone. Compared with the story so far, this continues the established pattern of anticipation → tension → acceptance but shifts the emphasis: acute danger and bureaucratic frustration have retreated, replaced by healing, curiosity, and emotional connection. The passage refreshes the arc by foregrounding companionship and quiet wonder rather than the earlier repetitive bureaucracy/dread beats.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="acceptance, relief">POV: Physical acceptance and relief — Kira acknowledges deep soreness but accepts it as normal microtrauma; movement makes the pain recede into a manageable background ache and her body "remembers" the rhythm. Cause: recovery mechanics, helpful companions (Rootwalker bringing water), and the comforting predictability of walking. Reader: experiences ease and small reassurance that the protagonist is actually recovering and regaining agency after earlier trauma.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, anticipation">POV: Intellectual and sensory wonder — Kira is captivated by the forest's odd species, the idea of 'time in layers,' and the networked physiology of the ecosystem; this expands her understanding and curiosity about the world. Cause: vivid, novel descriptions and Leafwhisper's enthusiastic explanations. Reader: feels uplifted curiosity and engaged anticipation about what else the planet's ecology and social structures will reveal.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: Warm attachment and bittersweet acceptance — Kira develops a quiet fondness for Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, and Scout, relishing the rhythm and companionship while feeling a small twist of sorrow at the thought of leaving them. Cause: repeated small kindnesses, predictable routines (rest stops, Scout cuddling), and shared conversation that humanizes the plant-guides. Reader: experiences tender warmth and mild sadness (a pleasant, bittersweet note) as the scene converts previous isolation into a fragile found family. Pattern note: This emotional shift toward belonging softens prior recurring frustration/dread beats and refreshes the story's emotional palette.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I reviewed the previous open-promises list against the events of this passage. The passage directly answers only one prior promise (Buddy's prediction of next-day muscle soreness), so that is recorded as fulfilled. Many prior threads are reinforced here (forest-as-network, guide dynamics, relay handoff timing, synthesized meals, Buddy's persona, Rootwalker's guardian behavior, etc.) and thus remain open and carriage-forward. I did not mark long-standing core mysteries (shuttle crash/navigation/atmospheric entry, SAM status, rescue timeline) as lapsed because the passage neither contradicts nor resolves them and they remain plot-relevant. Several tentative worldbuilding hooks are explicitly reinforced (integrated forest, maintained shelters, guide relay), so they stay open. I introduced a small set of new promises raised by material unique to this passage: the Spiral-type species' unusual time perception (a speculative cognitive/plot device), the explicit confirmation that Leafwhisper/Rootwalker will depart after the Territory One transfer (a firm short-term plot beat), a likely emotional payoff about Kira's attachment to these guides when they leave (tentative), the forest's communal breathing affecting human emotion/physiology (tentative), and Scout's ongoing adaptation/bonding (tentative). No additional prior promises were clearly abandoned in this passage, so the Lapsed list is empty.</reasoning>

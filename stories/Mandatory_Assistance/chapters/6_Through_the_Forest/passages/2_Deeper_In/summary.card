  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage continues the travel rhythm into day two and primarily tests the short-term physiological and social hypotheses set up at the end of day one. I checked each open promise from the prior passage against what this passage actually does: whether it was observed/confirmed (fulfilled), still relevant (carried forward/open), or shown to be dropped/moot (lapsed). The passage explicitly demonstrates Kira's predicted muscle soreness and recovery pattern, the effectiveness of the night/rest recovery for the immediate next day, and the functioning of Rootwalker's nonverbal guide signals in practice; those were original open promises and are paid off here. Many earlier, larger technical and story-level mysteries (ship logs, wreck analysis, sam fate, bio-container, nav anomaly, long-term food sustainability, water testing, Buddy limits, Elder response, etc.) remain untouched and therefore are carried forward. The passage also introduces a few concrete, smaller narrative setups that can be exploited later: the Spiral-type plants' non-linear time perception (a concept that could create future miscommunication or temporal-strangeness), the confirmed imminent handoff to Territory Two (and the emotional consequences of losing this team), the forest's system-wide breathing/rhythm (potential physiological/psychological effects), and Scout's visible learning (Scout may gain further capabilities or play a role). No previous open promise is outright abandoned in this passage; most remain relevant to future development.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="NEXT_DAY_MUSCLE_SORENESS_AND_RECOVERY">Buddy and Leafwhisper predicted significant muscle soreness the next day and that movement would ease stiffness; the passage shows Kira waking sore but improving once she starts walking, confirming the short-term prediction.</promise>
      <promise id="REST_RECOVERY_EFFECTIVENESS">The night's moss-bed rest was explicitly tested by Kira's next-day performance; the rest proved effective enough to allow the planned pace on day two (shorter distance) — immediate rest recovery was validated.</promise>
      <promise id="GUIDE_NONVERBAL_SIGNAL_SYSTEM">Rootwalker's stops/pacing acted as nonverbal signals that Kira has learned to follow; the passage shows Rootwalker's implicit signals being used successfully to coordinate rest and obstacles.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <open>

      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Kira still needs to secure long-term shelter, supplies, and a realistic rescue strategy; the facility solved immediate danger but long-term viability remains unproven.</promise>
      <promise id="BIO_CONTAINER_LOCKED_NEEDS_ACCESS">The biological sample container aboard the wreck remains locked and consuming power; gaining access or safely shutting it down is still necessary.</promise>
      <promise id="REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATE_COMMUNICATIONS">Distress beacon and ship transmitters remain damaged; attempts to repair or improvise off-world communications remain outstanding.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_RATIONING_AND_FORAGING">How to safely forage or source food outside formal provisioning, and whether the ecology can provide varied, reliable food across multiple territories, remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="WATER_QUALITY_TEST_NEEDED">Nearby water sources still require formal testing for potability and alien biological contaminants despite repeated drinking; formal testing remains necessary.</promise>

      <promise id="FOREST_ACOUSTIC_ANOMALY">The forest's musical breathing and acoustic signaling modes and their meaning remain unresolved; encountering other territories may deepen this mystery.</promise>
      <promise id="FIRST_CONTACT_CONSEQUENCES">Longer-term medical, cultural, ethical, and diplomatic consequences of first contact remain unresolved and will likely be tested as Kira meets more plant communities.</promise>
      <promise id="ALLIANCE_OR_MISUNDERSTANDING_RISK">The helpful, bureaucratic plant behavior continues to pose alliance and miscommunication risks to be navigated across multiple territorial handoffs.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The facility's documentation-first, protocol-driven bureaucracy remains an active constraint and potential point of friction throughout the journey.</promise>
      <promise id="PREVIOUS_VISITOR_RECORDS_AND_MATERIALS">Archives and prior-visitor human-model records likely exist but their location, contents, and accessibility remain unknown and could be relevant later.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_INTRODUCED">Florence’s role, authority, and relationship to central coordination remain unresolved and not addressed in this passage.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_COLOR_SIGNALLING_LEXICON">Color and pulsing appear to map to states but reliable decoding remains incomplete and could affect interactions in other territories.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_SALVAGE_AND_TECH_INTEGRATION">Facility repurposes salvaged hardware for robots and platforms; origin, supply chain, and implications for access/repair remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_WHEELED_PLATFORM_ORIGINS">Where salvaged wheels, joysticks, and other hardware originate (ship wreckage, prior visitors, internal fabrication) remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="ASSESSMENT_CREDENTIAL_RECORDS">Forms/credentials were accepted here and used to obtain travel permission, but the broader implications for record access and privileges remain to be explored.</promise>
      <promise id="CENTRAL_COORDINATION_RESOURCES_AND_RECORDS">The living facility’s internal record-keeping and resource inventories likely exist but their full scope and accessibility remain unknown.</promise>
      <promise id="LIVING_STRUCTURE_FUNCTIONS">How living architecture is grown, maintained, and whether structure contributes to plant cognition remain open and may be tested across territories.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_ROBOT_MANUFACTURE_AND_MAINTENANCE">Plants can field salvage-assembled robots (Remedy is operational); the extent of their manufacture, maintenance, and part sources remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="MUSHROOM_MEDICATION_SUPPLY_SUSTAINABILITY">Remedy can fruit medicinal compounds now, but whether the territory network can reliably produce varied, sufficient, and safe pharmacology/nutrition for the whole journey remains unproven.</promise>
      <promise id="TEMPORARY_QUARTERS_SAFETY_AND_RESOURCES">Immediate quarters served their short-term purpose, but long-term safety, privacy, and sanitation across other territories remain to be verified.</promise>
      <promise id="MEDICAL_CONSENT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_AUTONOMY">Remedy transmitted medical data to territories, but how consent, patient autonomy, and plant medical workflows will be handled en route and in other jurisdictions remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_ATTITUDE_TOWARD_HUMAN_BODIES">Remedy's clinical treatment and plant-centered perspective still raise ethical/behavioral concerns that may recur during the journey.</promise>
      <promise id="DAILY_WOUND_CARE_SCHEDULE">Remedy confirmed the wound healed, but the ongoing need for medical check-ins, emergent care while traveling, and logistics for care on the route remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="WATER_POTABILITY_RISK">Territorial rest facilities vary in water access; water potability and contamination risk still need formal testing per-leg.</promise>
      <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's emotional attachments to plant-agents (Remedy, Holloway, Scout) are forming; potential manipulation, dependency, or future pain remain a narrative risk.</promise>
      <promise id="ACCLIMATION_TO_BUREAUCRACY">Kira's increasing facility with forms and protocol continues and may influence autonomy, access, and future interactions with plant networks.</promise>
      <promise id="RESCUE_TIMELINE_UNCERTAINTY">Buddy's pessimistic rescue estimate (12–18 months) and general rescue timeliness remain unresolved—travel is a contested, not guaranteed, shortcut.</promise>
      <promise id="COMPANION_STABILITY">Scout continues to be a stable companion; durability and role over the full journey remain to be tested.</promise>
      <promise id="MICRONUTRIENT_DEFICIENCY_RISK">Risk that some micronutrients may be unavailable or only approximated by fungal chemistry remains a long-term concern during territorial provisioning.</promise>
      <promise id="MUSHROOM_FOOD_SUPPLY_SUSTAINABILITY">Initial food works and territories promise provisions, but overall ability to provide varied, sufficient, and safe food for Kira over weeks remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="DIGESTIVE_TOLERANCE_MONITORING">Kira's current tolerance to fungal compounds is acceptable, but continued monitoring for GI issues across multiple territories remains necessary.</promise>
      <promise id="ASSESSMENT_TIMELINE_STARVATION_RISK">The tension between procedural timelines and acute human needs was mitigated by expedited approval here, but systemic starvation risk tied to bureaucracy remains a structural concern.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_QUERY_SUBMITTED">A petition to Elder Heartwood has been filed and transmitted; Elder's network-side response is still pending independent of Kira's physical travel.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_TIMELINE">Holloway's prior estimates for Elder response times remain relevant; Elder still operates in slow time and could delay guidance even after physical arrival.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_MAY_PROVIDE_EXCEPTIONAL_ASSISTANCE">Elder is the best authority for exceptions, but whether they can or will provide the rescue- or comms-level assistance Kira needs remains uncertain.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_TRAVEL_DURATION_ESTIMATE">Transit days (roughly 21 across seven territories) remain an estimate; per-leg processing times are still subject to change.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_ROUTE_SEVEN_TERRITORIES">The planned route still passes through seven territories; the sequence and inter-territorial handoffs will shape the trip.</promise>
      <promise id="GUIDE_RELAY_HANDOFF_MODEL">The relay model of guides escorting across boundaries remains untested beyond Territory One; a handoff to new guides is expected at the next boundary.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_TOTAL_TIMELINE_REFINED">Day-one and day-two distances refined expectations, but the overall multiweek timeline and future delays remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_TRAVEL_SUPPORT_LIMITS">Buddy accompanied Kira but battery reserves and operational limits for a multiweek journey remain a constraint.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_RESPONSE_ON_ARRIVAL_UNCERTAIN">Even physical arrival at Elder Heartwood may not produce an immediate or useful response—Elder's slow processing remains a risk.</promise>
      <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_FIRST_HUMAN_ADAPTATION_RISK">Leafwhisper is still relatively inexperienced with human travelers; their novelty, pride, and talkative coping style may produce future miscommunication or emotional complications.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy's interest in Kira's return remains an interpersonal thread that could have future consequences or obligations.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_MINIMAL_BELONGINGS_RISK">Kira's reliance on territorial provisioning and near-total lack of personal supplies remain a vulnerability.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">The passage continues to confirm extensive mycorrhizal and above-ground connections; the larger question—whether the forest behaves as a distributed organism with political/resource consequences—remains to be explored.</promise>
      <promise id="INFORMATION_OVERLOAD_FROM_LEAFWHISPER">Leafwhisper's relentless commentary remains a potential operational risk for Kira's ability to process critical practical information; this dynamic persists.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_ADAPTABILITY_AND_AUTHORIZATION">Whether Buddy can shift modes or gain access/privileges to help with technical problems remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_SENSOR_BLINDSPOT">Buddy still may have perception gaps on the journey that need mapping and mitigation.</promise>
      <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira is clearly forming attachment to Leafwhisper and Rootwalker; the emotional consequences of upcoming handoffs are an open narrative risk.</promise>
      <promise id="MUSHROOM_FOOD_SUPPLY_SUSTAINABILITY">Territorial provisioning continues to supply mushroom paste, but the long-term variety and nutritional completeness for weeks/months remains unproven.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOUT_ROLE_EVOLUTION">Scout is learning rest-stop behavior and chemical sampling; Scout's growing capabilities and the role it may play on the journey are newly established and remain to be tested further.</promise>
      <promise id="SPIRAL_TYPE_TIME_LAYER_PERCEPTION">Introduced in this passage: Spiral-type plants reportedly perceive time in layers rather than linear sequences. This raises the promise of future miscommunication, unique cognitive perspectives, and narrative/temporal oddities to be explored.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_RHYTHM_EFFECTS_ON_HUMANS">The forest's system-wide expanding/contracting 'breathing' and shared rhythm produced a physical/emotional reaction in Kira (tight chest); the possible physiological or psychological impacts on travelers remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="TRANSFER_TO_TERRITORY_TWO_HANDOFF_SCHEDULE">Introduced in this passage: Leafwhisper confirms the boundary transfer will occur mid-afternoon tomorrow and that Territory One guides (Rootwalker and Leafwhisper) will leave; the handoff and its practical and emotional consequences remain pending.</promise>
      <promise id="UPCOMING_HANDOFF_EMOTIONAL_STRESS">Kira's developing attachment to the guide team establishes a forthcoming emotional test at the transfer; how she copes and whether it affects decision-making is unresolved.</promise>
    </open>
  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>Selected facts are those that add long-term continuity or worldbuilding that could matter later: travel progress and schedule, ongoing changes in Kira's physical conditioning and Scout's adaptation, ecological/phenomenological details about the forest (new dominant species, fused trunks), and a newly named/characterized plant type with a distinctive cognition (Spiral-types with layered time perception). Nothing in the passage contradicts previously established facts; this is a forward movement of the travel timeline and deeper description of the flora and companions' states.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DAY10_DISTANCE_TRAVELED_20_KM">On Day 10 the party covered approximately twenty kilometers during the travel day (the passage confirms 'twenty kilometers. Done.').</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_ONE_BOUNDARY_TOMORROW_TRANSFER">Tomorrow is the last day in Territory One; Kira will be transferred to Territory Two guides mid‑afternoon and Leafwhisper and Rootwalker will return home after the handoff.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_ADAPTATION_IMPROVED">Scout continues to adapt to travel—remains curious, explores ahead, returns with chemical signatures, and is showing less fatigue than on Day 1.</fact>
      <fact id="SPIRAL_TYPE_SPECIES_TIME_LAYERS">A distinct local plant type called 'Spiral-types' exists; they process information via rotational growth patterns and reportedly perceive time as concurrent layers rather than linear sequences, making communication with them disorienting but giving them strong long-timescale pattern recognition.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FOREST_DEEP_SECTION_SPECIES_SHIFT">Farther along the route the forest changes: canopy becomes denser, different species dominate (including fused-trunk living arches with merged root systems), and new mobile/flowering plant types appear.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_TRAVEL_STAMINA_IMPROVING">Kira's bodily adaptation to long-distance walking is progressing: initial soreness eases with movement, she finds a rhythm, and her stamina/efficiency on multi-hour travel is improving.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Cues in the text establish a clear overnight break and a single travel day. The passage opens with "I wake sore" and Leafwhisper's immediate "Good morning!", which mark the start as the morning after the previous passage's sleep. Morning routines described (water, mushroom-paste breakfast, brief conversation) occupy perhaps 30–60 minutes before they set out. The party then walks through the day with periodic rests and a mid/late-day rest stop; the narrator explicitly says the day is "only about twenty kilometers" and later: "When they reached the second rest shelter that evening, I feel tired but strong. Twenty kilometers. Done." That anchors the end of the passage to evening of the same day.

      Estimated durations: 20 km walked at the same steady guided pace (comparable to the prior day's 23 km that was described as 8–9 hours including breaks) plausibly requires roughly 6–9 hours on the trail depending on break length and pace; the passage mentions regular rests and a midday rest, so ~7–9 hours of travel plus morning prep and evening wind-down fits. The gap since the previous passage is an overnight sleep period (evening activities, sleep, morning recovery). The previous passage ended with "Tonight, I sleep," so the time between passages is the intervening night — roughly 12–18 hours depending on when "night" began.

      Minor note on the provided previous-summary time: the summary lists Day 9 ~14:30 which seems inconsistent with the narrative description of dusk/bioluminescence and "Tonight, I sleep." If the previous passage actually ended later (early evening), the overnight gap is shorter; either way, the narrative implies a single night of sleep between passages.

      Overall: start = next morning after sleeping; end = that same day's evening at the second shelter after completing ~20 km; gap = an overnight period; timing is generally plausible given described pace, breaks, and recovery.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>Day 10 ~07:00 (morning)</starts>
    <ends>Day 10 ~18:00 (evening)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~12–18 hours (overnight: evening arrived, shelter and sleep, then morning wakeup, breakfast and prep)</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Waking the morning after the previous passage and walking ~20 km in one day with regular rests fits the established pace and the earlier day's 23 km (8–9 hours with breaks). The described morning routine, mid-day rest, and arrival at a second shelter by evening are consistent. The only minor inconsistency is the previous-summary timestamp (Day 9 ~14:30) versus the narrative's dusk/bioluminescence and sleeping—this likely reflects an approximate timestamp, but it does not make the overnight gap or the day’s travel implausible.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I identified every character who is either present or mentioned in the passage. Present: the narrator (I) is the protagonist Kira_Voss; Buddy speaks at the start; Leafwhisper and Rootwalker are with the group throughout; Scout is active and exploring; Holloway is explicitly mentioned as an example back at the facility. No other named characters from the provided list are referenced. "Entered" should list characters who arrive during this passage but weren’t present at the start — none fit that criterion (Rootwalker "appeared with water" but was already present at the end of the previous passage). "Exited" should list characters who were present at the start and leave before the passage ends — no departures are described. The only available entity from the provided list that could reasonably apply to the scene is the planet/location card; the passage refers to territories and a facility but the only matching entity path supplied is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so I include that as the relevant entity.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>Added events from the current passage: Kira's soreness and recovery during day two, the shortened ~20 km day, Rootwalker providing water/food, Buddy's ongoing monitoring, Scout's exploratory behavior, observations about Spiral-type plants and plant-networked society, completion of day two at a second rest shelter, and that tomorrow is the last day in Territory One with a planned transfer to Territory Two guides and the two guides returning home. Consolidated/updated earlier material: removed the prior three-day crossing estimate and replaced it with the new timeline (transfer tomorrow); kept essential survival and travel facts (crash, Holloway care, guides assigned, Buddy/Scout accompanying, day-one distance and camp). Removed mostly atmospheric detail and repetitive dialogue while preserving plot-relevant developments and character actions.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active (limited battery).
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet atmosphere breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Kira entered Holloway plant collective for care, received temporary quarters and a Scout companion; Remedy treated her leg and transmitted medical records; Holloway noted a possible long-term micronutrient gap.
      - Buddy estimated external rescue/search reach measured in months; Holloway filed a relay but Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for relay rescue.
      - Two Territory One guides assigned: Leafwhisper (talkative, plant-network specialist) and Rootwalker (taciturn terrain specialist); Buddy and Scout accompany Kira.
      - Dawn departure established a steady pace with regular rests; Leafwhisper synthesized mushroom-based meals for nutrition; day one distance ~23.7 km and they camped in a woven plant shelter.
      - Day two: Kira woke sore but movement eased; guides shortened the day to ~20 km; Rootwalker provided water and mushroom paste; Buddy monitored vitals and commented on muscle adaptation.
      - Deeper forest ecology observed: Spiral-type vines encountered (noted to process information via rotational growth and perceive time non-linearly); Leafwhisper explained that many plants share resources/information through merged root and fungal networks, giving rise to complex plant societies.
      - Scout continued to explore and return chemical/ sensory data; Kira adapted to the travel rhythm and bonded with the guides and Scout.
      - They reached the second rest shelter after ~20 km; Leafwhisper announced tomorrow will be the last day in Territory One, Kira will be transferred mid-afternoon to Territory Two guides, and Leafwhisper and Rootwalker will return home.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV: The passage emphasizes quiet recovery, growing physical competence, and emotional attachment. Kira wakes sore and initially resigned to the pain, then experiences relief as movement makes the soreness fade and her body remembers the rhythm. Simultaneously, intellectual/affective wonder at the forest and its radically different cognition fills her with curiosity and enlargement of perspective. Finally a soft feeling of belonging and bittersweet attachment emerges as she recognizes the guides as a found family and feels a pang at the thought of leaving. The reader rides this gentle, domestic arc: from small worry about recovery into comfort/relief, then sensory wonder, and lastly warm, slightly sad affection. There are multiple beats (physical adaptation → wonder/learning → belonging/bittersweetness) rather than one dominant tone. Compared with the story so far, this continues the established pattern of anticipation → tension → acceptance but shifts the emphasis: acute danger and bureaucratic frustration have retreated, replaced by healing, curiosity, and emotional connection. The passage refreshes the arc by foregrounding companionship and quiet wonder rather than the earlier repetitive bureaucracy/dread beats.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="acceptance, relief">POV: Physical acceptance and relief — Kira acknowledges deep soreness but accepts it as normal microtrauma; movement makes the pain recede into a manageable background ache and her body "remembers" the rhythm. Cause: recovery mechanics, helpful companions (Rootwalker bringing water), and the comforting predictability of walking. Reader: experiences ease and small reassurance that the protagonist is actually recovering and regaining agency after earlier trauma.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, anticipation">POV: Intellectual and sensory wonder — Kira is captivated by the forest's odd species, the idea of 'time in layers,' and the networked physiology of the ecosystem; this expands her understanding and curiosity about the world. Cause: vivid, novel descriptions and Leafwhisper's enthusiastic explanations. Reader: feels uplifted curiosity and engaged anticipation about what else the planet's ecology and social structures will reveal.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: Warm attachment and bittersweet acceptance — Kira develops a quiet fondness for Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, and Scout, relishing the rhythm and companionship while feeling a small twist of sorrow at the thought of leaving them.

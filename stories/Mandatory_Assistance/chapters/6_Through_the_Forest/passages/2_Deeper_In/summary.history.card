      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>At the end of the passage the party has completed the second day of travel and is camped at the second woven-plant rest shelter. Kira is physically present in the shelter, sore from exertion but medically stable (muscle microtrauma within expected adaptation, monitored by Buddy). Scout is nearby and content, alternating rest and low activity. Buddy remains active in Kira’s pocket monitoring vitals. Leafwhisper is synthesizing the evening meal (gray mushroom paste) and continuing to converse; Rootwalker is physically checking and reinforcing the shelter structure and standing guard at the entrance. The shelter contains moss bedding, a water feature (spring-fed), and visible fungi species (luminescent/fruiting mushrooms and other local specimens). The surrounding forest is deeper into Territory One: denser canopy, fused trunks forming living arches, extensively merged root and mycorrhizal networks, Spiral-type vines and clusters of luminescent mushrooms encountered along the route. Ambient lighting is evening/dusk with the canopy filtering light into green-gold patterns and bioluminescence increasing. Distance and itinerary facts: today’s travel ≈20 km; cumulative travel since entry into Territory One ≈43.7 km (previous ≈23.7 km + today ≈20 km). Plan/constraints relevant for the next scene: tomorrow is the final day in Territory One with an expected mid-afternoon boundary transfer to Territory Two guides; Rootwalker and Leafwhisper intend to return home after transfer. No new injuries or equipment losses are reported; Kira’s packed items and medical records remain with her, and provisioning (synthesized mushroom paste, shelter, water) is available for the night.</reasoning>
        <state>Kira is resting on a moss bed inside a woven-plant rest shelter at dusk of day two in Territory One; she is sore but medically stable with Buddy monitoring vitals from her pocket. Scout is beside her, content. Leafwhisper is synthesizing mushroom-paste dinner and conversing nearby; Rootwalker is checking and reinforcing the shelter and standing guard at the entrance. The shelter contains moss bedding, a spring-fed water feature, and fruiting/luminescent mushrooms. The surrounding forest is deeper and denser—fused trunks, merged root/mycorrhizal networks, Spiral-type vines, and luminescent fungi—and bioluminescence is increasing. The party traveled ~20 km today (≈43.7 km total so far); tomorrow is scheduled as the final day in Territory One with a mid-afternoon transfer to Territory Two guides. No new injuries or lost equipment; provisioning and shelter are intact.</state>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I compared the new passage to the prior open-promises list and checked what the new text explicitly confirms, repeats, or introduces. Very little from the prior open list is closed by this passage — most threads are reiterated or reinforced but remain unresolved (identity of maintainers, long-term provisioning reliability, AI status, rescue timelines, bureaucratic consequences, etc.). I closed only those items that the passage demonstrates as functioning now (repeated on-route provisioning and the guides' demonstrated navigation/protection role) and a housekeeping closure of an earlier mileage confirmation that has already been established as fact. No major mysteries (pilot deaths, SAM status, beacon, shuttle viability, etc.) were investigated or abandoned, so they stay open. The passage also introduces a few new, specific setups/foreshadowing beats (transfer to new territory/guides tomorrow; the Spiral-type plants with layered-time perception; Scout’s learning of patterns and potential utility/limitations; luminescent mushrooms encountered by Scout) that create immediate short-term expectations or potential complications, so I list those as new open promises.</reasoning>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I looked for durable facts that will matter in later scenes (character traits, species/world rules, persistent behaviors or capabilities). I ignored transient details (Kira's immediate soreness, today's exact meal taste, the specific rest-shelter) and facts already covered in the provided summary. The passage adds new, reusable worldbuilding about a plant type's cognition (Spiral-types), clarifies Scout's sensing/collection methods and learning behavior, and records the plants' explicit conceptual distinction between physical networked sharing and individual identity (and HR manuals' role in forming that distinction). These are not contradictions of earlier facts; they extend and refine plant-society behavior and sensory capabilities. No genuine contradictions with the previously established facts were found.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="SPIRAL_TYPE_TEMPORAL_PERCEPTION">Spiral-type vines/species perceive time as layered (past/present/future concurrently) rather than strictly linear, making direct communication with linear-time species challenging but giving them excellent pattern-recognition across long timescales.</fact>
          <fact id="SPIRAL_TYPE_ROTATIONAL_INFORMATION_PROCESSING">Spiral-types process information through rotational growth patterns (a distinct cognitive/processing architecture) rather than linear signaling.</fact>
          <fact id="SCOUT_SENSORY_MODALITY">Scout gathers information primarily via physical perception (bounce patterns, surface texture) and chemical signatures, not via direct thought-sharing or verbal language.</fact>
          <fact id="SCOUT_LEARNS_ROUTINE_PATTERNS">Scout demonstrates rapid learning of traveler routines (e.g., rest-stop patterns) and returns to report/bring back chemical signatures from discoveries.</fact>
          <fact id="PLANT_INDIVIDUAL_IDENTITY_VS_NETWORK_SHARING">Although many plants physically share resources and underground networks (fused trunks/merged roots), they maintain distinct individual identities and experiences; HR-style frameworks helped them conceptualize and respect individual needs within shared systems.</fact>
          <fact id="EARTH_FORESTS_HAVE_FUNGAL_NETWORKS_BUT_LESS_INTENTIONAL">Plant speakers assert that Earth forests possessed fungal/resource-sharing networks (mycorrhizal communication) but were less intentionally coordinated/less 'conscious' in their collective behaviors compared to this planet's plant society.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens with the narrator waking sore and Buddy/Leafwhisper greeting them with "Good morning," so it clearly begins the morning after the previous passage's evening shelter. The scene includes breakfast and morning preparations (water, mushroom paste), then a full day of walking with at least one mid-day rest and ends at the second rest shelter "that evening." Leafwhisper states the day's planned distance is about twenty kilometers and that they will reach the second shelter in the evening; they also say "Tomorrow's the last day... we'll reach the boundary mid-afternoon," which places the passage clearly as the full next day of travel. How much time passes in-passage: roughly a waking period + a full day of travel (morning start through evening arrival). How much time since previous passage: the previous passage ended at ≈18:00 (day 9 evening). This passage begins the following morning — an overnight gap of roughly 11–13 hours depending on sleep start/end times. Plausibility: The timeline is plausible. Completing ~20 km in one day with regular short rests and an evening arrival is consistent with the prior day's pace (23 km) and with the guide's stated recommendations (breaks every ~2 hours). Waking sore and having soreness ease after moving is physiologically realistic. The gap (overnight sleep, morning routine, departure) is entirely reasonable given the activities described.</reasoning>
        <starts>~06:30 (day 10 morning)</starts>
        <ends>~18:00 (day 10 evening)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>≈12 hours (overnight sleep and morning preparations between previous evening ≈18:00 and this morning start). During this gap they slept, recovered, had a breakfast of mushroom paste, Buddy and Leafwhisper ran morning checks, and then they set out.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The characters had time to sleep, recover, eat, and begin travel in the morning. Walking ~20 km with periodic rest stops and arriving at an evening shelter fits the pace established in the previous passage (23 km on day one) and matches the guides' stated break and pacing recommendations. No obvious timing contradictions are present.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed characters who are either present or explicitly mentioned in the passage. Present: the narrator Kira ("I") and the companions Buddy, Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, and Scout all appear directly in the text. Holloway is mentioned by Leafwhisper as a species back at the facility, so I included that as a present/mentioned character. No character newly arrives during the scene (no one not present at the start physically enters), so ENTERED is empty. No character is explicitly shown leaving before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The only available entity from the provided list that could be relevant to the scene is the Sector_7-Gamma-412 planet, so I included that.</reasoning>

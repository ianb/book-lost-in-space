    Territory One journey - and it's WONDERFUL. Three days with Leafwhisper (talks constantly, Kira loves it) and Rootwalker (silent, competent, grows on her). Forest as living network is AMAZING. Buddy asks tons of questions about everything. Uncharted road trip vibes - "Mav's journey through the Seven Valleys!" Arrival at boundary is exciting - first inter-territorial transfer!

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage advances several medium-term, story-relevant states: the plants/facility are preparing a coordinated defense (specific tactics and role assignments), Florence's leadership style shifts from commanding to soliciting and integrating input (a social-development fact likely to affect future group dynamics), and contact with the hostile plants moves from probing to an imminent coordinated return/attack. These are not merely scene-level details because they establish tactical dispositions, resource allocations, and interpersonal dynamics that will shape upcoming confrontations and decisions. I found no direct contradictions with previously established facts—this passage refines and develops prior states (e.g., depleted Remedy reserves, Runner injury, hostile withdrawal/return) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SHIFT_TO_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP">Florence's leadership has shifted from issuing commands to actively soliciting, integrating, and coordinating others' tactical input (she asks for recommendations and synthesizes group contributions into a combined plan).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSIVE_STRATEGY_LAYERED_GAPS">The facility will adopt a layered-defense strategy: multiple thinner barrier layers with deliberate gaps between them so attackers encounter staged countermeasures in the gaps rather than a single thick wall.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_MISDIRECTION_FALSE_WEAK_POINT">Runner will create an underground false weak point (leaking sap/damaged root sections) to misdirect hostile plants toward the northwest while real reinforcements are placed at the true vulnerable southwest/life-support area.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_AGGRESSIVE_COMPOUND_TRAPS">Remedy will focus remaining chemical resources to create concentrated aggressive compound deployments (chemical 'trap' zones) placed in the barrier gaps; plan calls for four concentrated zones (three ready, fourth in progress).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TIME_TO_FULL_READINESS_APPROX_20_MINUTES">The group estimates roughly twenty minutes (maybe less) to reach full defensive readiness, and they expect the hostiles to likely attack within that short timeframe.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_COOPERATION_IMPROVING">The facility's social dynamics show a measurable shift: contributors are exchanging proposals and implementing a jointly synthesized plan rather than following unilateral commands—an authentic cooperative mode replacing yesterday's necessity-based coordination.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILES_PROBING_AND_COORDINATED_RETURN">Runner detected hostile roots probing the perimeter overnight (not attacking, mapping) and now reports movement: a coordinated, multi-directional approach indicating the hostile plants are returning to attack imminently.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_ASSIGNED_EVAC_COORDINATION_FOR_KIRA">Holloway is assigned responsibility for evacuation routes and will position themselves near Kira to coordinate emergency evacuation if the defenses fail.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSE_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS_CONFIRMED">The immediate tactical assignments are confirmed: Runner handles underground misdirection and monitoring, Velvet builds layered barriers/gaps, Remedy readies chemical traps for the gaps, Holloway manages evacuation, and Florence coordinates and synthesizes the plan.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: "Morning arrives way too early," "It's mid-morning now," and explicit countdowns later ("We have twenty minutes until full readiness") give clear anchors. The passage opens at the start of the morning following the night after the previous passage; characters explicitly spent the night on watch and Florence predicted the hostile plants would return "by mid-morning." The passage moves from waking/assessment through a period of planning and targeted preparation (discussing Runner's underground misdirection, Velvet's layered barriers, Remedy's chemical production, and Holloway's evacuation routing). A hard marker appears when Florence says they have ~20 minutes until full readiness; soon after Runner detects incoming movement and the passage ends as the attack begins. How much time passes within the passage: from initial wake/mid-morning assessment through discussion and execution of prioritized actions to the moment of first detected movement — roughly on the order of tens of minutes to a couple of hours, with a concrete final segment of ~20 minutes called out. End point: just as the hostile plants are detected returning. Gap from previous passage: the previous passage ended at 13:00 (1 PM). The current passage clearly takes place the next morning (mid-morning), so the gap is roughly ~21 hours (13:00 previous day → mid-morning next day). Plausibility: Given the story's established capabilities (plants can grow emergency barriers quickly, Remedy can concentrate chemical production if focused, Runner can manipulate underground roots), the described preparations (Runner planting a false weak point, Velvet growing thinner layered barriers, Remedy concentrating on a few trap zones) in the space of minutes-to-tens-of-minutes is plausible within the story's internal logic. The only potential confusion is the reader-facing phrasing: saying "morning arrives" when the prior passage's timestamp was 13:00 is fine if interpreted as the next day's morning, but the manuscript should make that next-day jump explicit to avoid momentary disorientation.</reasoning>
    <starts>~10:30 (mid-morning, approximate; the morning after the previous passage)</starts>
    <ends>~10:50 (mid-morning, approximate; at the moment hostile movement is detected, minutes before/at initial attack)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈21 hours (previous ended 13:00 the prior day → this is the next day's mid-morning). During the gap they spent the night on watches, Runner monitored underground movement, and Florence expected the plants to return mid-morning.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (night watch → mid-morning reconnaissance and ~20-minute final preparations → immediate detection of return) matches the characters' described actions and previously established rapid-response capabilities. Suggest making the "next morning" transition explicitly clear in text if a reader might otherwise assume the previous 13:00 and this "morning" refer to the same calendar day.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>All characters who appear in the passage are the same eight who were present at the end of the previous passage: Kira (narrator), Scout, Runner, Velvet, Holloway, Remedy, Florence, and Buddy (mental/comms presence). No new characters arrive during this scene and no one leaves before the scene ends—everyone remains and is described as preparing/acting. The only available entity that fits the scene context is the planet/location card provided (the facility is on Sector 7-Gamma-412).</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage shows a tactical and social turning point: attackers are returning imminently, Runner detected probing focused on the southwest (life-support), and Florence shifts from commanding to soliciting and integrating others' ideas. The defenders adopt a new, specific layered-defense plan (Runner false weakness in NW, Velvet multilayer barriers with gaps, Remedy concentrated chemical traps in gaps, Holloway prepares evacuation, Kira positioned behind Velvet's third layer). Resource/status details (Runner wounded, Velvet damaged, Remedy nearly depleted, life support intact) remain relevant and are retained. I consolidated earlier, overlapping bullets about the initial assault, Florence's earlier confession/isolation, and the reactive defense into fewer, chronologically ordered points so the summary stays compact and focused on plot-relevant developments and the imminent battle.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM is offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy is active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
      - Florence publicly confessed fabricating Elder Twist's pronouncements, was isolated and distrustful, but remained as tactical coordinator out of necessity.
      - Hostile plants labeled Kira "contamination," launched a coordinated multi-pronged assault (spores, corrosive vines, underground roots) that breached outer sections; defenders contracted to a defensible core and stabilized the situation.
      - Under Florence's coordination Runner, Velvet and Remedy executed countermeasures: Runner severed roots and monitored underground movement, Velvet built emergency barriers, and Remedy neutralized spore clouds; a major root surge was slowed, blocked and chemically withered.
      - Casualties and depletion: Runner is injured and regenerating; Velvet is structurally damaged; Remedy's chemical reserves are nearly depleted; life support and core medical systems remain intact.
      - Attackers withdrew in an organized, staged manner to regroup and adapt; Florence predicted adapted tactics and renewed probing.
      - Mid-morning Runner detected hostile roots probing and mapping the perimeter overnight, with concentrated interest on the southwest where life-support is concentrated; attackers are returning and will likely adapt.
      - Florence shifted from top-down command to genuine collaboration—she solicited and integrated suggestions from Runner, Velvet, Remedy and Holloway rather than simply issuing orders.
      - Defenders adopted a new layered-defense plan: Runner will create an underground false weakness in the northwest while reinforcing the southwest; Velvet will grow multiple thinner barrier layers with deliberate gaps; Remedy will focus limited production on concentrated aggressive chemical trap zones placed in those gaps; Holloway will manage evacuation routes and Kira will shelter behind Velvet's third barrier layer in the central core.
      - Group dynamics improved: contributors negotiated positions and timing directly, Florence coordinated synthesis and encouraged trust, and Buddy noted the cooperation as more authentic than yesterday's necessity-based coordination.
      - Status and timeline: Velvet's third layer ~80% complete, Remedy has three trap zones ready with a fourth in progress, Runner's misdirection is in place; full readiness estimated in ~20 minutes but hostile plants have been detected approaching from multiple directions—attack imminent.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings and why: The narrator is exhausted, frightened, and on edge at the start—sleepless from the prior attack and expecting the hostile plants' return—so their baseline is dread and tense vigilance. As the scene progresses they watch a subtle but important shift in group dynamics: Florence moves from commanding/control to listening and integrating others' ideas, which produces a real sense of cooperation. The POV responds with guarded hope and belonging (relief that the group might truly repair itself and protect them). In the final moments, the narrator is still scared about the imminent attack but trusts the collective plan and feels bolstered by that trust.

      Reader experience: The reader begins sharing anxiety and suspense (the looming return of attackers and damaged facility), then experiences a release and uplift as the team demonstrates authentic collaboration—a moral and tactical payoff after the betrayal arc. The closing lines restore tension (attack is imminent) but it's now a charged, hopeful anticipation rather than helpless panic.

      Multiple beats or one dominant tone: There are multiple emotional beats: initial dread/tension → emergent hope/belonging (cooperation) → anticipatory hope/tension as the attack nears. The dominant arc is a move from fear to communal empowerment while retaining imminent danger.

      Comparison to the story's emotional pattern so far: This continues the story's recurring anticipation→dread→acceptance/agency arc, but it importantly flips the repetitive motif of fractured trust and bureaucratic paralysis into a reparative, collaborative beat. Where previous beats emphasized betrayal, paralysis, or procedural frustration, this passage shows interpersonal repair and authentic cooperation—so the emotional pattern is evolving rather than simply repeating.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="dread, tension">POV: Exhausted, sleepless, and on edge—expecting the hostile plants to return and aware the facility is severely damaged. The concrete details (collapsed floors, toxic sludge, injured allies) amplify helplessness and urgent vulnerability. Reader: Shares acute suspense and anxiety; the scene reactivates fear tied to the recent attack and primes concern about whether the group can hold together.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: A subtle emotional pivot as Florence solicits input and integrates others' ideas—Runner, Velvet, Remedy, and Holloway contribute tactical suggestions and Florence adapts. The narrator observes genuine cooperation and feels a fragile, growing sense of connection and hope (not naive, but real). Reader: Experiences relief and uplift—the long arc of betrayal and fractured trust is visibly beginning to repair, producing emotional payoff and renewed investment in the characters' survival and relationships.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Fear remains—hostiles are detected and attack is imminent—but it is now paired with confident anticipation and trust in the collaboratively formed defense plan; the narrator is scared but believes they will be protected. Reader: Feels a tension-filled, energizing anticipation: suspense returns (attack incoming) but is tempered by hope and moral satisfaction that the group can act together rather than fall apart.</beat>
    </beats>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      This passage is a direct aftermath-and-preparation scene that realizes some immediate tactical forecasts from the last passage and sets up a concrete new defensive plan and a social shift. The most concrete payoff is that the hostile plants did, in fact, return as predicted and the cast immediately prepares a layered defense; the narrative promise about an organized return (and adjusted tactics) is paid off. Overnight recovery rotations and triage happened and the morning shows their effects (people restless but functioning), so the recovery/rotation promise is also realized. Many long-running, world-level mysteries (crash coordinates, navigation/FTL failure, SAM's deeper fate, rescue timelines) are untouched and remain open. Several older, tentative worldbuilding hints (river-stone maintenance, floating clusters, handoff rituals) are not reinforced here and can be reasonably lapsed for now. New, firm tactical setups are introduced (layered barriers, Runner's decoy, chemical trap zones, explicitly mapped evacuation plans and a short attack-timer) and a clear social promise is introduced: Florence shifting her leadership style from command to collaborative integration — this changes how future interactions will play out and is a setup to be tested in upcoming conflict. A softer, tentative social promise is that necessity-born cooperation might be turning into genuine trust; the passage supplies evidence, but it remains a fragile, tentative promise for future payoff.

      Decisions made:
      - Fulfilled (paid off) from the previous open-promises: HOSTILE_RETREAT_AND_RETURN_ADJUSTED_TACTICS (hostiles returned/attacked as predicted) and REPAIR_OVERNIGHT_RECOVERY_ROTATIONS (overnight recovery/rotations occurred and morning shows the consequences).
      - Carried forward: all major unresolved plot mysteries and immediate operational constraints (resource depletion, Florence reintegration choice, extended siege expectation, living-architecture responsiveness, Remedy's limits, etc.) because the passage either reinforces them or does not contradict them.
      - Lapsed: a subset of older, tentative worldbuilding promises that received no reinforcement here (river-stone maintenance, floating clusters mobility, well-maintained crossing record, guide-handoff opacity, wetlands travel-testing), because they are speculative background details not used or referenced and are now lower priority for narrative momentum.

      Notes on categorization rules used:
      - Only promises that were in the prior OPEN_PROMISES list are eligible to be marked fulfilled or lapsed here.
      - New promises introduced in this passage are listed in OPEN_PROMISES (not in FULFILLED_PROMISES), because they are setups for upcoming action (the layered defense and Florence's collaborative leadership are active commitments to be tested).
      - Tentative flags: soft social/psychological setup items are marked tentative; explicit tactical plans and explicit facts (timers, decoy placement, who will do what) are marked firm.

      <promise id="FLORENCE_REINTEGRATION_DECISION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Formal decision whether Florence will be reintegrated or remain exiled remains pending; passage makes social progress but does not resolve it.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOPE_OF_FABRICATION_INVESTIGATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Which past guidance was Elder-authoritative and which was Florence's fabrication remains an active investigation and is untouched here.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_ARC" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's arc of authority-without-Elder-mantle continues; her cooperative leadership here advances that arc but doesn't resolve it.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE" tentative="true" introduced="32">Florence's suggestion that Kira could act as a proxy remains an available option; not resolved by this passage but still in play.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_RETREAT_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="32">Florence's conditional retreat promise (she will withdraw if the group rejects her) remains an active constraint—she's staying only while allowed.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_IMMINENT" tentative="false" introduced="34">Key defenders' resources are exhausted or near-exhaustion (Remedy, Velvet, Runner)—this remains an urgent unresolved operational constraint.</promise>
      <promise id="EXPECT_EXTENDED_SIEGE" tentative="false" introduced="34">Florence's tactical read to prepare for an extended siege rather than a single assault remains valid—this passage enacts preparations based on that forecast.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONTINUED_SUPPORT_FOR_KIRA" tentative="false" introduced="34">Florence said she will continue to help as long as necessary (explicitly for Kira); she reaffirms and acts on that commitment in this passage.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_SOCIAL_FOUNDATION_FROM_NECESSITY_COOPERATION" tentative="true" introduced="34">Necessity-based cooperation might create a social foundation for later reconciliation; the passage shows cooperation growing into collaboration but the promise remains tentative.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP" tentative="false" introduced="35">Newly introduced: Florence shifts her mode from authoritarian command to integrating others' input—she actively solicits and synthesizes contributions; this sets up a testable social and leadership arc.</promise>
      <promise id="LAYERED_DEFENSE_STRATEGY" tentative="false" introduced="35">Newly introduced/focused tactical setup: implement multiple thinner barrier layers with gaps, place chemical trap zones in the gaps, and combine Runner's underground misdirection—this is an explicit, concrete plan the group will execute against the imminent attack.</promise>
      <promise id="RUNNER_FALSE_WEAK_POINT_DECOY" tentative="false" introduced="35">New tactical promise: Runner will create a convincing underground false weak point (leaking sap/damaged roots) to draw enemy attention away from life-support/southwest areas.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_CONCENTRATED_CHEM_TRAPS" tentative="false" introduced="35">New tactical promise: Remedy will concentrate limited chemical resources into a small number of aggressive trap zones (three or four), trading breadth for concentrated effectiveness.</promise>
      <promise id="VELVET_MULTILAYER_BARRIERS" tentative="false" introduced="35">New tactical promise: Velvet will grow multiple, thinner barrier layers (at least three), creating gaps where countermeasures can be placed—this is their prioritized construction plan.</promise>
      <promise id="HOLLOWAY_WILL_COORDINATE_EVACUATION" tentative="false" introduced="35">New/affirmed operational promise: Holloway maps evacuation routes and commits to position near Kira to coordinate immediate emergency evacuation if layers fail.</promise>
      <promise id="IMMINENT_ATTACK_TIMER" tentative="false" introduced="35">New immediate tension: Florence projects minutes to mid-morning until the hostiles act; the plan is time-boxed (about twenty minutes until readiness, maybe less), creating an urgent countdown.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_TRUST_BEGINNING" tentative="true" introduced="35">New tentative social promise: The group's cooperation is moving beyond necessity into actual collaborative decision-making (Florence soliciting input, members contributing); this may develop into durable trust but is tentative.</promise>

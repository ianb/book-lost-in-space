  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>Approach: I reviewed each open promise from the previous passage and checked whether the current passage (a) advanced it without resolving it, (b) explicitly resolved/fulfilled it, or (c) rendered it moot/abandoned. I also noted explicit new setups introduced here that create future expectations (Chekhov's guns, tactical gambits, social beats). Key observations: the central tactical threat (hostile plants returning) was predicted and then manifested — the attackers are coming, so the 'imminent return' expectation is realized. Florence's behavior changed in a narratively meaningful way: she moved from issuing commands out of necessity to soliciting and synthesizing input, thereby enacting the conditional reengagement she promised earlier (she continues to help and explicitly asks for collaborative input). The group also shifts from survival-by-obedience to apparent authentic cooperation; that undermines the previous framing that obedience was purely temporary compliance under duress, so that earlier promise becomes less accurate and is therefore marked as lapsed. Most logistical, resource, and political problems (Remedy's depletion, structural damage, decisions to repair vs relocate, Runner's injury, Velvet's resource constraints, toxic sludge, etc.) remain unresolved and are carried forward. The passage introduces concrete tactical setups (Runner's false weak point, Velvet's layered barriers with gaps, Remedy's concentrated trap deployments, limited time until attack) that function as immediate narrative promises: these will be tested in the imminent engagement and have explicit stakes (success, failure, evacuation). I treated promises as 'fulfilled' only when the prior promise's core claim was actually realized in this passage (hostiles returned; Florence reengaged and is actively coordinating under her declared condition). I treated a prior claim as 'lapsed' only when the passage made that prior framing no longer accurate (compliance-as-solely-duress is no longer descriptive). Everything else remains an open narrative thread.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="HOSTILES_RETREAT_AND_IMMINENT_RETURN">The previous passage predicted the hostile plants would withdraw and return with adjusted tactics; this passage shows that return in mid-morning and establishes the immediate renewed assault as imminent (the attackers are detected and moving in). The predicted return occurred, so that expectation was paid off here (even though the larger conflict continues).</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_REENGAGEMENT">Florence earlier pledged to help 'as long as necessary' for Kira; in this passage she continues to coordinate and explicitly offers to help while the threat persists, and she enacts that conditional reengagement by both leading and soliciting contributions from others.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="TEMPORARY_COMPLIANCE_UNDER_DURESS">Previously the group's obedience to Florence was framed as pragmatic and temporary. This passage shows a shift toward authentic collaboration (Florence asking for input, contributors offering ideas, integrated planning), making the prior framing — that compliance is only temporary obedience under duress — no longer fully accurate and therefore effectively lapsed as a fixed expectation.</promise>
    </lapsed>
    <open>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM">The adaptive, coordinated hostile assaults continue and will be tested in the imminent attack; whether they displace the group, are permanently repelled, or force relocation remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">Distrust previously undermined cooperation; the passage shows a nascent authentic cooperation that may improve defense, but the long-term impact of this social shift on sustained defensive effectiveness is still unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">Florence's tactical aid opened the door to cooperation; the passage establishes early steps (collaborative planning) but the timeline, conditions, and mechanics for formal reintegration and forgiveness remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence has moved toward collaborative leadership here but her longer-term social trajectory (withdrawal, conditional engagement, or gradual reintegration into the community) is still unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">Their deeper goals and thresholds for negotiation or occupation remain unexplored; their adaptive tactics continue to be tactical rather than ideological, leaving motivation unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">The community remains brittle: infrastructure damage, resource depletion, and injuries continue to threaten morale and resilience despite improved cooperation.</promise>
      <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Territorial demarcations and related rituals were not addressed here and their post-crisis authority and role remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">The significance and escalation logic of enemy territorial marking (and how to counter it) remain open for study and response.</promise>
      <promise id="EXTERNAL_RELOCATION_PRESSURE">Facility damage and resource scarcity still press the community toward a repair-or-relocate decision; that strategic choice remains imminent but undecided.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Institutional and interpersonal trust erosion persists; early cooperative signs are promising but the erosion's political consequences remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="INTRA_COMMUNITY_VALIDATION">Florence's competence continues to gain de facto validation through results; formal reputation processes and their consequences remain unsettled.</promise>
      <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">Care and maintenance routines remain under strain from injuries and resource limits; who does what and how often remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy remains depleted and emotionally strained; although they contribute tactically here, their future capacity and willingness to sustain medical/support roles is still uncertain.</promise>
      <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal rituals around boundary control and authority remain under strain and their enforcement after the assault is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">The bioluminescent signaling and networked behavior of hostiles continues to be a tactical advantage; mapping and countermeasures are incomplete.</promise>
      <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's attachments (Scout, Runner, Velvet, Holloway) remain operationally and narratively relevant vulnerabilities; their consequences were exposed and remain to be explored.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Securing long-term shelter, supplies, and a sustainable plan (repair vs relocate vs signal for rescue) remains unresolved and more precarious given current damage.</promise>
      <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Immediate shortages (Remedy's limited reserves, Velvet's resource strain, medical supplies, structural damage) persist and require decisions not yet made.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Which elder communications were genuine vs fabricated remains unaddressed here; political/investigative consequences remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The role of facility rituals and bureaucracy versus emergency improvisation remains unresolved after this ad-hoc but collaborative preparation.</promise>
      <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Communications repair, medical/water continuity, and broader structural fixes are still outstanding technical/logistical problems needing resources and decisions.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">The facility remains heavily damaged and resources are depleted; the burden of repair and sustainability is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner remains injured but active; their limited recovery window and the operational risk of reduced underground capability remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="CHEMICAL_NEUTRALIZATION_SECONDARY_HAZARD">Toxic sludge and environmental hazards from earlier neutralization reactions persist and remain a cleanup/health risk.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILES_NETWORK_ADVANTAGE">The hostile plants' networked communications/coordination remain an adaptive advantage; understanding and countering that network is still outstanding.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_DEPLETION_CRISIS">Remedy is still capacity-limited; the passage shows concentrated production choices but Remedy's overall depletion remains a critical constraint.</promise>
      <promise id="VELVET_SUSTAINABILITY_FAILURE">Velvet remains resource-constrained; although they can switch to layered, thinner defenses to mitigate immediate failure, sustainability under continued assault remains an unresolved risk.</promise>
      <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner's injuries still limit full function despite active participation; their recovery limitations remain an operational concern.</promise>
      <promise id="OVERNIGHT_VULNERABILITY_WINDOW">The overnight weakened perimeter has passed, but a new imminent-attack vulnerability window exists while preparations complete; the vulnerability condition remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="INFRASTRUCTURE_REPAIR_OR_RELOCATE_DECISION_IMMINENT">The larger repair vs relocate strategic decision remains unresolved and presses on the group as resources are consumed by immediate defense.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_ISOLATION_PERSISTENCE">Florence's isolation has lessened (she's soliciting input and being acknowledged), but full social acceptance and forgiveness remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_FLORENCE_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP">Newly established: Florence's shift to collaborative leadership (asking for input, integrating others' plans) promises a changed social dynamic and different political consequences to be tested in the imminent battle and beyond.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_LAYERED_DEFENSE_STRATEGY">Newly established tactical promise: Velvet will create multiple thinner barrier layers with gaps, turning some gaps into deliberate trap zones; this layered approach will be tested when the hostiles attack.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_RUNNER_MISDIRECTION_PLAN">Newly established tactical setup: Runner will fabricate a false weak point (northwest) to divert the enemy and protect the actual vulnerable southwest life-support area; its success is a pending narrative payoff.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_FOCUSED_DEPLOYMENT">Newly established gamble: Remedy will concentrate limited chemical resources into three (then four) trap zones in Velvet's gaps—this allocation risk promises consequences depending on whether attacked locations match these traps.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_TIME_PRESSURE_ATTACK_IMMINENCE">Newly established immediate-stakes promise: Hostiles are expected to attack before full readiness (minutes), creating a cliffhanger where incomplete preparations will be tested under time pressure.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_TRUST_AS_STRATEGIC_DECISION">New social/tactical promise: Florence's explicit solicitation of input and the command to 'trust each other's judgment' make trust an explicit strategic variable — future decisions will hinge on whether trust holds under fire.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_KIRA_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_ROUTINE">New tactical setup: Holloway has mapped evacuation routes and will prioritize Kira's emergency extraction if barriers fail; this prepares an evacuation payoff/complication in the imminent attack.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_TARGET_SOUTHWEST_LIFE_SUPPORT">New tactical promise: Intelligence flags the southwest (life-support concentration) as a likely target; that area's defense is now a pivotal narrative stake for the upcoming engagement.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Newly implied: Remedy's choice to focus production on selected zones (and potentially abandon others) is a narrative gamble that will create consequences if attacks fall outside concentrated defenses.</promise>
    </open>
  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage advances several medium-term, story-relevant states: the plants/facility are preparing a coordinated defense (specific tactics and role assignments), Florence's leadership style shifts from commanding to soliciting and integrating input (a social-development fact likely to affect future group dynamics), and contact with the hostile plants moves from probing to an imminent coordinated return/attack. These are not merely scene-level details because they establish tactical dispositions, resource allocations, and interpersonal dynamics that will shape upcoming confrontations and decisions. I found no direct contradictions with previously established facts—this passage refines and develops prior states (e.g., depleted Remedy reserves, Runner injury, hostile withdrawal/return) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SHIFT_TO_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP">Florence's leadership has shifted from issuing commands to actively soliciting, integrating, and coordinating others' tactical input (she asks for recommendations and synthesizes group contributions into a combined plan).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSIVE_STRATEGY_LAYERED_GAPS">The facility will adopt a layered-defense strategy: multiple thinner barrier layers with deliberate gaps between them so attackers encounter staged countermeasures in the gaps rather than a single thick wall.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_MISDIRECTION_FALSE_WEAK_POINT">Runner will create an underground false weak point (leaking sap/damaged root sections) to misdirect hostile plants toward the northwest while real reinforcements are placed at the true vulnerable southwest/life-support area.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_AGGRESSIVE_COMPOUND_TRAPS">Remedy will focus remaining chemical resources to create concentrated aggressive compound deployments (chemical 'trap' zones) placed in the barrier gaps; plan calls for four concentrated zones (three ready, fourth in progress).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TIME_TO_FULL_READINESS_APPROX_20_MINUTES">The group estimates roughly twenty minutes (maybe less) to reach full defensive readiness, and they expect the hostiles to likely attack within that short timeframe.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_COOPERATION_IMPROVING">The facility's social dynamics show a measurable shift: contributors are exchanging proposals and implementing a jointly synthesized plan rather than following unilateral commands—an authentic cooperative mode replacing yesterday's necessity-based coordination.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILES_PROBING_AND_COORDINATED_RETURN">Runner detected hostile roots probing the perimeter overnight (not attacking, mapping) and now reports movement: a coordinated, multi-directional approach indicating the hostile plants are returning to attack imminently.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_ASSIGNED_EVAC_COORDINATION_FOR_KIRA">Holloway is assigned responsibility for evacuation routes and will position themselves near Kira to coordinate emergency evacuation if the defenses fail.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSE_ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS_CONFIRMED">The immediate tactical assignments are confirmed: Runner handles underground misdirection and monitoring, Velvet builds layered barriers/gaps, Remedy readies chemical traps for the gaps, Holloway manages evacuation, and Florence coordinates and synthesizes the plan.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage: "Morning arrives way too early," "It's mid-morning now," and explicit countdowns later ("We have twenty minutes until full readiness") give clear anchors. The passage opens at the start of the morning following the night after the previous passage; characters explicitly spent the night on watch and Florence predicted the hostile plants would return "by mid-morning." The passage moves from waking/assessment through a period of planning and targeted preparation (discussing Runner's underground misdirection, Velvet's layered barriers, Remedy's chemical production, and Holloway's evacuation routing). A hard marker appears when Florence says they have ~20 minutes until full readiness; soon after Runner detects incoming movement and the passage ends as the attack begins. How much time passes within the passage: from initial wake/mid-morning assessment through discussion and execution of prioritized actions to the moment of first detected movement — roughly on the order of tens of minutes to a couple of hours, with a concrete final segment of ~20 minutes called out. End point: just as the hostile plants are detected returning. Gap from previous passage: the previous passage ended at 13:00 (1 PM). The current passage clearly takes place the next morning (mid-morning), so the gap is roughly ~21 hours (13:00 previous day → mid-morning next day). Plausibility: Given the story's established capabilities (plants can grow emergency barriers quickly, Remedy can concentrate chemical production if focused, Runner can manipulate underground roots), the described preparations (Runner planting a false weak point, Velvet growing thinner layered barriers, Remedy concentrating on a few trap zones) in the space of minutes-to-tens-of-minutes is plausible within the story's internal logic. The only potential confusion is the reader-facing phrasing: saying "morning arrives" when the prior passage's timestamp was 13:00 is fine if interpreted as the next day's morning, but the manuscript should make that next-day jump explicit to avoid momentary disorientation.</reasoning>
    <starts>~10:30 (mid-morning, approximate; the morning after the previous passage)</starts>
    <ends>~10:50 (mid-morning, approximate; at the moment hostile movement is detected, minutes before/at initial attack)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈21 hours (previous ended 13:00 the prior day → this is the next day's mid-morning). During the gap they spent the night on watches, Runner monitored underground movement, and Florence expected the plants to return mid-morning.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (night watch → mid-morning reconnaissance and ~20-minute final preparations → immediate detection of return) matches the characters' described actions and previously established rapid-response capabilities. Suggest making the "next morning" transition explicitly clear in text if a reader might otherwise assume the previous 13:00 and this "morning" refer to the same calendar day.</plausibility>

    <reasoning>All characters who appear in the passage are the same eight who were present at the end of the previous passage: Kira (narrator), Scout, Runner, Velvet, Holloway, Remedy, Florence, and Buddy (mental/comms presence). No new characters arrive during this scene and no one leaves before the scene ends—everyone remains and is described as preparing/acting. The only available entity that fits the scene context is the planet/location card provided (the facility is on Sector 7-Gamma-412).</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage shows a tactical and social turning point: attackers are returning imminently, Runner detected probing focused on the southwest (life-support), and Florence shifts from commanding to soliciting and integrating others' ideas. The defenders adopt a new, specific layered-defense plan (Runner false weakness in NW, Velvet multilayer barriers with gaps, Remedy concentrated chemical traps in gaps, Holloway prepares evacuation, Kira positioned behind Velvet's third layer). Resource/status details (Runner wounded, Velvet damaged, Remedy nearly depleted, life support intact) remain relevant and are retained. I consolidated earlier, overlapping bullets about the initial assault, Florence's earlier confession/isolation, and the reactive defense into fewer, chronologically ordered points so the summary stays compact and focused on plot-relevant developments and the imminent battle.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM is offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy is active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
      - Florence publicly confessed fabricating Elder Twist's pronouncements, was isolated and distrustful, but remained as tactical coordinator out of necessity.
      - Hostile plants labeled Kira "contamination," launched a coordinated multi-pronged assault (spores, corrosive vines, underground roots) that breached outer sections; defenders contracted to a defensible core and stabilized the situation.
      - Under Florence's coordination Runner, Velvet and Remedy executed countermeasures: Runner severed roots and monitored underground movement, Velvet built emergency barriers, and Remedy neutralized spore clouds; a major root surge was slowed, blocked and chemically withered.
      - Casualties and depletion: Runner is injured and regenerating; Velvet is structurally damaged; Remedy's chemical reserves are nearly depleted; life support and core medical systems remain intact.
      - Attackers withdrew in an organized, staged manner to regroup and adapt; Florence predicted adapted tactics and renewed probing.
      - Mid-morning Runner detected hostile roots probing and mapping the perimeter overnight, with concentrated interest on the southwest where life-support is concentrated; attackers are returning and will likely adapt.
      - Florence shifted from top-down command to genuine collaboration—she solicited and integrated suggestions from Runner, Velvet, Remedy and Holloway rather than simply issuing orders.
      - Defenders adopted a new layered-defense plan: Runner will create an underground false weakness in the northwest while reinforcing the southwest; Velvet will grow multiple thinner barrier layers with deliberate gaps; Remedy will focus limited production on concentrated aggressive chemical trap zones placed in those gaps; Holloway will manage evacuation routes and Kira will shelter behind Velvet's third barrier layer in the central core.
      - Group dynamics improved: contributors negotiated positions and timing directly, Florence coordinated synthesis and encouraged trust, and Buddy noted the cooperation as more authentic than yesterday's necessity-based coordination.
      - Status and timeline: Velvet's third layer ~80% complete, Remedy has three trap zones ready with a fourth in progress, Runner's misdirection is in place; full readiness estimated in ~20 minutes but hostile plants have been detected approaching from multiple directions—attack imminent.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings and why: The narrator is exhausted, frightened, and on edge at the start—sleepless from the prior attack and expecting the hostile plants' return—so their baseline is dread and tense vigilance. As the scene progresses they watch a subtle but important shift in group dynamics: Florence moves from commanding/control to listening and integrating others' ideas, which produces a real sense of cooperation. The POV responds with guarded hope and belonging (relief that the group might truly repair itself and protect them). In the final moments, the narrator is still scared about the imminent attack but trusts the collective plan and feels bolstered by that trust.

      Reader experience: The reader begins sharing anxiety and suspense (the looming return of attackers and damaged facility), then experiences a release and uplift as the team demonstrates authentic collaboration—a moral and tactical payoff after the betrayal arc. The closing lines restore tension (attack is imminent) but it's now a charged, hopeful anticipation rather than helpless panic.

      Multiple beats or one dominant tone: There are multiple emotional beats: initial dread/tension → emergent hope/belonging (cooperation) → anticipatory hope/tension as the attack nears. The dominant arc is a move from fear to communal empowerment while retaining imminent danger.

      Comparison to the story's emotional pattern so far: This continues the story's recurring anticipation→dread→acceptance/agency arc, but it importantly flips the repetitive motif of fractured trust and bureaucratic paralysis into a reparative, collaborative beat. Where previous beats emphasized betrayal, paralysis, or procedural frustration, this passage shows interpersonal repair and authentic cooperation—so the emotional pattern is evolving rather than simply repeating.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="dread, tension">POV: Exhausted, sleepless, and on edge—expecting the hostile plants to return and aware the facility is severely damaged. The concrete details (collapsed floors, toxic sludge, injured allies) amplify helplessness and urgent vulnerability. Reader: Shares acute suspense and anxiety; the scene reactivates fear tied to the recent attack and primes concern about whether the group can hold together.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: A subtle emotional pivot as Florence solicits input and integrates others' ideas—Runner, Velvet, Remedy, and Holloway contribute tactical suggestions and Florence adapts. The narrator observes genuine cooperation and feels a fragile, growing sense of connection and hope (not naive, but real). Reader: Experiences relief and uplift—the long arc of betrayal and fractured trust is visibly beginning to repair, producing emotional payoff and renewed investment in the characters' survival and relationships.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: Fear remains—hostiles are detected and attack is imminent—but it is now paired with confident anticipation and trust in the collaboratively formed defense plan; the narrator is scared but believes they will be protected. Reader: Feels a tension-filled, energizing anticipation: suspense returns (attack incoming) but is tempered by hope and moral satisfaction that the group can act together rather than fall apart.</beat>

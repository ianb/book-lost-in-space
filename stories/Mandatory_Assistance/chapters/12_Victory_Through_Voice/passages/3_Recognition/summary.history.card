      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>I track what was changed or confirmed in the passage vs. the prior scene. The hostile command node that had surfaced in the central core is explicitly removed: Runner and Remedy coordinate extraction and move the massive root network outside the facility perimeter. The surrounding hostile forces have withdrawn and their coordination is offline; the command node is destroyed/withering and then disposed of. Plant defenders remain injured and resource-depleted (Runner and Velvet leaking sap; Remedy low but producing some healing compounds slowly; Florence’s wheeled platform scorched/damaged). Velvet’s multi-layer barriers held but are partially damaged and depleted; structural damage to the facility (central floor breach, debris, scorch marks, unstable ceiling/floor) persists and needs repair. Chemical residues and torn root debris remain in trap and central areas, and toxic/withering compounds had been used and may contaminate ground. The group congregates in the least-damaged/common area for recovery in late afternoon; individuals take recovery positions (Runner coiled and regenerating, Velvet spreading whatever growth remains, Remedy producing healing compounds, Holloway settled, Florence positioned among the group rather than isolated, Kira and Scout nearby). The facility is quiet but unstable and contaminated, with evacuation routes still known and rebuilding required. Hostile threat is ended for now but could regroup later.</reasoning>
        <state>The facility is in an immediate recovery state: the massive hostile command root network has been extracted from the central core and moved outside the facility perimeter; surrounding hostile forces have withdrawn and lost coordination. The central core and several trap zones still contain torn root debris, toxic/withering chemical residues, and contaminated ground. Velvet’s layered barriers remain but are partially damaged and resource-depleted. Structural damage (a ruptured central floor, scorch marks, debris, and continuing ceiling/floor instability) persists and repairs are required. Runner and Velvet are injured and leaking sap; Remedy is depleted but producing limited healing compounds; Holloway, Florence (wheeled platform scorched), Kira, and Scout are present and recuperating in the least-damaged common area. It is late afternoon; the facility is quiet and exhausted but temporarily secure, with evacuation routes known and reconstruction resources needed.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          Summary of reasoning:

          What was paid off: The passage shows concrete, operational follow-through on two immediate threats that had been flagged in the previous passage. The withering command node is removed and taken out of the core (so the hazard it posed in-place is handled), and the acute, narrow post-battle vulnerability window (the immediate, high-risk interval) was actively managed by coordinated disposal and immediate recovery actions. Those two previously-open items are therefore fulfilled.

          What remains open: Nearly every longer-term, structural, political, ethical, and resource promise from the prior list remains unresolved. The passage advances social repair and establishes an important precedent (inclusion, shared decision‑making, recognition of contributions), but it does not close the larger questions: whether Florence’s past fabrications will have lingering consequences, whether the group will formalize delegation or outcome‑based validation, whether hostiles will adapt or return, how the facility will be repaired or re‑supplied, or how leadership norms will settle. Many promises are advanced (progress toward trust, an invitation extended and accepted), but none of those longer arcs are completed here — they are explicitly presented as fragile, conditional, or nascent.

          New promises introduced here: the text creates a few concrete, forward‑looking stakes not present before. Most important: moving the command node outside the perimeter creates a new set of risks/opportunities to be handled (external contamination, retrieval by hostiles, or study/intelligence); Velvet’s assessment that rebuilding will require time and resources establishes a concrete repair/timeline promise; and because Runner/Remedy extracted the node rather than destroying it in place, there is now a possible intelligence/analysis opportunity that could change future operations.

          What I did NOT list: I avoided listing any promise that the passage both introduced and resolved in the same scene (for example, the specific invitation to Florence to join the recovery—introduced and accepted within this passage—was not listed as a new open promise per the instruction).
        </reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_WITHERING_HAZARD">The withering hostile command node that was occupying the central core (leaking toxic compounds and creating contamination/intelligence potential) was carefully extracted and moved outside the facility perimeter by Runner and Remedy — the in‑place hazard was removed and managed.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMEDIATE_POST_BATTLE_VULNERABILITY_WINDOW">The narrow, immediate post‑battle vulnerability (the acute window when the team was depleted and the facility exposed) was actively managed: the command node was removed, recovery actions began immediately, and the group organized triage/recovery—so the immediate, acute window was addressed.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">The larger hostile campaign remains a strategic threat beyond this engagement; although the current assault was disrupted, the long‑term territorial campaign is still a live danger and may resume.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_EXPERIMENTAL_LESSON">The team tried decentralized decision‑making and delegation under pressure and learned from it; whether this becomes a sustained practice or institutional norm remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Florence’s social position improved (recognition, invitation to join recovery) but the deeper political and moral consequences of her past betrayals are not settled; full restoration or institutional consequences remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">The group’s cohesion has strengthened in the short term, but social fractures and governance fragility persist; baseline defenses (social and structural) remain at risk.</promise>
          <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">The ethical/political question of whether and when advice from Florence (given her past fabrications) is admissible remains unresolved — the group recognizes present value but is still processing past deception.</promise>
          <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">There is a risk the group will preferentially accept guidance based on successful outcomes rather than provenance or ethics; the passage shows movement toward valuing actions, but whether this becomes an explicit norm is still open.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">Florence’s role and contributions were acknowledged informally; how credit, record, or accountability for her specific tactical contributions will be handled institutionally is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence’s formal exile still exists as an institutional fact; the invitation to join recovery is a step but does not formally rescind exile or settle political ramifications.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The downstream operational, political, and informational effects of Florence’s earlier fabrications have not been fully audited or investigated; the full scope remains unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Holloway’s authority and the broader leadership configuration were tested; shifting toward collaborative leadership creates new dynamics and potential instability that remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="TIME_PRESSURE_ON_TRUST_REPAIR">Trust repair so far happened under extreme time pressure and crisis; whether these nascent repairs will persist when the crisis ends remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout’s role as Kira’s sentinel and emotional anchor is reinforced by the scene and remains a continuing functional and emotional resource for the group.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_WITHDRAWAL_IF_REJECTED">Florence previously retained the option to withdraw if rejected; although she accepted inclusion here, that conditional leverage still exists as a political factor if acceptance later wanes.</promise>
          <promise id="BEACON_REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_COMMS">External communications/ beacon options remain unaddressed here and are still critical for rescue, resource requests, or outside assistance.</promise>
          <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM’s operational status and potential role were not revisited and remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">Immediate survival has been addressed; a comprehensive long‑term plan (relocation, stockpiles, governance, repairs) is still required and unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Structural governance questions about authority, attribution, and decision rules remain unsettled despite successful emergency consensus.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_THREAT">Key actors (Velvet, Remedy, Runner) are depleted or injured; resource exhaustion and capacity shortfalls remain an acute ongoing threat to defense and recovery.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_IMPACTS_DEFENSE">Runner remains injured and regenerating; their compromised condition is still a tactical vulnerability for future operations.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">Velvet notes the facility needs serious repair; the long‑term habitability and logistics issues created by structural damage remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DEFACTO_COMMAND_DURING_CRISIS">Florence remains the central crisis coordinator in practice but has shifted toward soliciting input; whether this de facto role persists or is formally redefined is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="EXTENDED_SIEGE_PREPARATION_AND_RECOVERY">Preparation for an extended siege and comprehensive recovery tasks remain incomplete; the group must prioritize repairs, stockpiles, and defensive planning.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_CONTINUES_CONDITIONAL_ASSISTANCE">Florence acted on a conditional commitment to help; the long‑term dependency and political consequences of that conditional assistance remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBLE_FOUNDATION_FOR_FORGIVENESS">The victory created a fragile foundation for forgiveness or reconciliation, but explicit forgiveness has not been granted and the possibility remains unproven.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP">Florence’s turn toward collaborative leadership was validated in the crisis; whether this becomes a durable leadership model is still open.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_CONCENTRATED_DEPLOYMENT_RECOVERY">Remedy exhausted chemical reserves in battle and is slowly producing healing compounds; questions about chemical resupply and strategic sustainability remain.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_BUILDING_MOMENTUM">The passage advances nascent trust and mutual recognition; whether that momentum endures across non‑crisis conditions remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_ADAPTATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_LOSS">Although coordination collapsed with the command node’s destruction, the hostiles are likely to adapt (decentralize, relocate, or change tactics) — that longer‑term adaptation threat remains.</promise>
          <promise id="POST_BATTLE_RESOURCE_AND_MEDICAL_CRISIS">Immediate triage and slow recovery are underway, but an ongoing resource and medical crisis (chemical resupply, healing time, personnel capacity) is still present and unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="COLLECTIVE_DECISIONMAKING_PRECEDENT">A precedent for consensus‑driven, collaborative decision‑making was established in the crisis; whether it will become institutional practice remains an open question.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_OUTSIDE_PERIMETER_RISK">New in this passage: the command node was extracted and moved outside the facility perimeter — that externalization creates new risks and opportunities (environmental contamination, retrieval by hostile forces, or outsider discovery) that must be managed.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_REPAIR_TIMELINE_AND_RESOURCE_REQUEST">New in this passage: Velvet’s assessment that rebuilding will require time and resources establishes a concrete repair/timeline and resource solicitation promise — the group must plan and obtain materials/assistance to restore habitability and defensive integrity.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_ANALYSIS_OPPORTUNITY">New in this passage: because Runner and Remedy removed the command node intact rather than simply destroying it in place, there is a concrete opportunity (and promise) to analyze the node for intelligence — if they preserve it and have safe means to study it, this could yield tactical insights, but it also requires protocols and resources to exploit safely.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage documents several durable interpersonal and morale changes among the facility defenders after the battle — shifts that will affect future cooperation, roles, and emotional dynamics. I extracted only facts that matter beyond the immediate scene (changes in group attitude, Florence's acceptance of inclusion, individual self-perception shifts). I did not record transient details already summarized (who is physically present, structural damage, removal of the command node, timing). I found no contradictions with previously established facts; the passage represents a clear development/progression from earlier pragmatic acceptance and fractured trust toward a tentative, valued inclusion of Florence and increased mutual recognition.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_HAS_STRONG_SENSE_OF_VICTORY_AND_SHARED_RELIEF">The group experiences a durable morale shift: relief and satisfaction beyond mere survival, framing the outcome as 'we won together,' which strengthens group cohesion and sets a positive emotional baseline for future cooperation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_OFFERS_RECOGNITION_TO_FLORENCE">Holloway and other plant-defenders formally acknowledge Florence's recent right actions and offer explicit recognition of her value and contributions (distinct from tactical necessity).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_OFFERS_RECOGNITION_BUT_NOT_FORGIVENESS">The group distinguishes recognition from forgiveness: they will acknowledge Florence's genuine change and value her contributions but are not yet offering forgiveness and expect processing of past betrayals to continue.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_ACCEPTS_COMMUNITY_INVITATION">Florence accepts the group's invitation to join recovery and to be part of the community (expressing cautious hope and willingness to be included rather than remain exiled).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_BEGINS_TO_BELIEVE_IN_POSSIBILITY_OF_REDEMPTION">Florence expresses that she is beginning to believe current choices can create the possibility of being valued despite past mistakes (a personal cognitive/emotional shift toward hope for partial redemption).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_FEELS_VALIDATED_BY_CONTRIBUTION">Runner reports feeling competence and validation because Florence listened and encouraged Runner's underground intelligence, which had strategic value during the battle.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_FEELS_VALIDATED_BY_CONTRIBUTION">Velvet reports that being invited to contribute its layered barrier idea and having it acknowledged by Florence made Velvet feel empowered and valued for creative defensive innovation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_FEELS_VALIDATED_AND_INNOVATIVE">Remedy states that being recognized for chemical innovation and tactical analysis changed its self-perception from strictly protocol-driven to capable of innovation and offensive contributions.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_FOUNDATION_FOR_AUTHENTIC_COOPERATION_ESTABLISHED">The gathering and mutual acknowledgment after the battle establish an evidential foundation for more authentic cooperation and trust-building among the defenders (a behavioral/social state likely to affect future group decisions).</fact>

      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the text place this passage immediately after the battle ended in the previous passage and then span through the recovery period into late afternoon. The passage opens with explicit aftermath actions that begin "immediately": removal of the withering hostile command node, structural assessment, and the start of recovery. The characters then hold a recovery gathering where they talk, process the battle, and settle in to rest. The passage explicitly says the gathering "continues into late afternoon" and then disperses as exhaustion wins, so the passage covers several hours of activity. Given the previous passage was marked ~10:35 (approx) at its end and this passage begins directly after that, the start time is ~10:35. The described events—extracting and moving a massive root system, structural assessment, a multi-person debrief and bonding session, slow regenerative/healing processes and then settling into late-afternoon rest—reasonably occupy several hours. I estimate the passage ends in the late afternoon (~17:30), so roughly 7 hours elapse during the passage. The gap from the previous passage to this one is effectively none (it continues immediately). The timing is plausible: disposal of the command node and a long recovery/debrief can take hours; gradual regeneration and chemistry-based healing fit a multi-hour window; the social processing and eventual dispersal into rest fits a late-afternoon endpoint.</reasoning>
        <starts>~10:35</starts>
        <ends>~17:30</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — begins immediately after the previous passage (~10:35). Actions at the start (removal of the command node, damage assessment, initial recovery) flow directly from the battle's end.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The passage covers extraction and removal of a massive root system, structural assessment, a lengthier debrief/recovery gathering, and slow biological/chemical regeneration—activities that plausibly require several hours. No clear contradictions appear between the characters' injuries/recovery status and the multi-hour timeframe; the move from immediate cleanup to late-afternoon rest is reasonable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed every character who is either mentioned or present in the passage. The scene opens with the survivors already assembled (Kira, Scout, Florence, Remedy, Runner, Velvet, Holloway). Buddy (the AI companion) appears partway through when Kira addresses them and Buddy replies, so Buddy is an entrant during the passage. No character who is present at the start permanently leaves before the passage ends—Runner and Remedy briefly move outside to dispose of the command node but later are part of the recovery gathering—so there are no exits that remove a character from the scene by the end. The only available location/entity relevant to the scene is the Sector 7-Gamma-412 planet context.</reasoning>

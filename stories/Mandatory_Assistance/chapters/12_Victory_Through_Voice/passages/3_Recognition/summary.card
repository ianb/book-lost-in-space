  <facts>
    <reasoning>I reviewed the passage for durable facts that will matter in later scenes (changes to relationships, institutional states, resource/cleanup actions, and long-term social dynamics). I excluded transient details (who sat where, exact timing of the talk) and kept items that would affect continuity: removal of the hostile command node, a concrete change in Florence’s social status (invitation/acceptance and presence in the common area), and the collective’s explicit shift in how it regards Florence (recognition now, forgiveness deferred). None of these statements contradict earlier established facts; they mostly extend or refine existing developments (e.g., the command node was destroyed earlier; here it is being physically removed; Florence had returned earlier and here is being offered fuller inclusion).</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_COMMAND_NODE_EXTRACTED_OUTSIDE">The withering hostile command node is being physically extracted and removed from the facility perimeter: Runner and Remedy coordinated careful removal of the massive root system to move it outside (the node was leaking toxic compounds).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_INVITED_TO_JOIN_RECOVERY_AS_COMMUNITY_MEMBER">Holloway formally invited Florence to join the group for recovery not as tactical coordinator but as a community member; the invitation is stated to be genuine and Florence accepts (cautiously).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PRESENT_IN_COMMON_AREA_AND_NOT_ISOLATING">Florence positions herself among the group in the facility's common/recovery area (no longer isolating in her sparse chamber).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_EXPLICITLY_RECOGNIZES_FLORENCE_VALUE_BUT_DEFERS_FORGIVENESS">The collective explicitly acknowledges Florence's choice to help and her ability to empower others (shifting from 'need' to 'value'), while Holloway clarifies the group is not yet offering forgiveness and that processing the betrayal will take time.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FOUNDATION_FOR_GENUINE_TRUST_ESTABLISHED">A durable shift in social dynamics occurred: shared combat experience produced a measurable increase in authentic cooperation, mutual recognition, and morale (a foundation for longer-term trust and collaboration is now being laid).</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues in the passage place it immediately after the battle described in the previous passage. The text explicitly says "Recovery starts immediately," and describes immediate tasks (removing the withering command node, assessing structural damage) followed by an extended recovery gathering. A clear cue — "The recovery gathering continues into late afternoon" — indicates the passage spans from the immediate aftermath (mid-morning) through several hours of cleanup, conversation, and resting, ending in late afternoon when exhaustion wins and everyone disperses to rest. Given the previous passage ended at ~11:10 (mid-morning), the start is effectively that moment. The end is marked by "late afternoon" and the facility settling into exhausted quiet, so the passage lasts several hours (roughly six or more). Activities described (coordinated extraction of a massive root system, damage assessment, chemical treatments, slow regeneration/healing, extended group conversation and social processing) plausibly take multiple hours. Minor uncertainty: removing a massive command-node root system could be very time-consuming depending on scale, but the text implies coordinated effort and that the team has time because the hostile plants withdrew, so a multi-hour window is reasonable.</reasoning>
    <starts>11:10</starts>
    <ends>17:30 (late afternoon, approximate)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. Recovery begins right after the battle; disposal of the command node and initial repairs/assessments start within minutes.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The passage covers immediate cleanup and a multi-hour recovery/conversation period, which fits the actions described: extracting and moving the withering command node outside the perimeter, assessing structural damage, deploying healing/chemical compounds, and an extended communal debrief and social processing. Those tasks reasonably occupy several hours into late afternoon. One minor caveat: depending on the literal size and complexity of the command node, full removal might take longer than a single afternoon, but the narrative frames it as an initial coordinated extraction and disposal followed by ongoing recovery — which is consistent and believable.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters mentioned or present in the passage: Kira (narrator), Buddy (AI companion), Scout, Runner, Velvet, Holloway, Remedy, and Florence. All eight appear in dialogue or action. No new characters from the available list are introduced during the scene, so no one "enters" who wasn't already present at the start. Although Runner and Remedy briefly move the command node outside the facility perimeter, both return and participate in the recovery gathering, so they do not exit before the passage ends. The passage refers to a facility and its perimeter, but no entity from the provided entity list is explicitly referenced, so no entities are included.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage describes immediate recovery and reconciliation after the battle. Defender teams remove the dying command node from the core; Velvet inspects structural damage and notes repair/resource needs; Florence and Holloway lead a key interpersonal turning point where Holloway acknowledges Florence's change from controlling commander to an empowering collaborator, offers community recognition (not full forgiveness), and invites Florence to join the group in recovery. Florence accepts cautiously. The group holds a recovery gathering where members share battle experiences, acknowledge each other's contributions, and begin genuine trust-building. Core systems remain intact but defenders are exhausted and damaged and will need time/resources to rebuild. I will add bullets for command-node disposal, the Holloway–Florence reconciliation and invitation, Florence's acceptance, the recovery gathering and mutual recognition, and the facility repair needs. I will consolidate prior notes about Florence's status (from distrusted outsider to included member) and keep existing points about casualties, depleted reserves, and the attackers' withdrawal, removing redundant emotional details.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal perimeter scout and stays close to Kira in the central core.
      - Florence previously confessed fabricating Elder Twist's pronouncements and was distrusted; she remained tactical coordinator but shifted toward genuine collaboration during the crisis.
      - Hostile plants coordinated a multi-pronged assault using bioluminescent signaling; defenders fell back to a defensible core and implemented layered defenses (Runner misdirection, Velvet barriers, Remedy chemical traps).
      - Attack escalated when hostiles exploited a prepared false weakness and committed overwhelming forces; simultaneous pressures nearly surrounded defenders.
      - Combined defender action (Velvet constriction, Runner severing, Remedy dissolution, Holloway blocking) forced a massive hostile command node to surface inside the perimeter and the node was destroyed, severing attacker coordination; hostiles withdrew completely.
      - Runner and Remedy carefully removed the dying command node's massive root system from the central core and carried it outside the facility perimeter to eliminate toxic leakage.
      - Facility sustained heavy structural damage and exhausted resources; Velvet reported repairs and resources will be required and that recovery will take time.
      - Defenders are exhausted and depleted but core life-support and medical systems remain intact; Runner, Velvet and Remedy are injured or resource-depleted but are beginning regeneration/repair.
      - Holloway publicly acknowledged that Florence moved from controlling tactics to empowering collaboration, recognized each plant's contributions, and addressed past betrayals—clarifying that hurt remains but genuine change is being recognized.
      - Holloway invited Florence to join the community for recovery (explicitly offering recognition, not immediate forgiveness); Florence accepted cautiously.
      - Recovery gathering: plants shared battle experiences, acknowledged one another's tactical innovations, and began building authentic trust and cooperation; Scout and Buddy noted the positive shift in group dynamics.
      - The hostile threat is neutralized, the group's cohesion is strengthened, and the facility settles into exhausted quiet as recovery and rebuilding plans begin.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings: Kira experiences a warm, relieved satisfaction that goes beyond mere survival — a sense of communal victory and the emotional payoff of trust beginning to be rebuilt. She is attentive to Florence's vulnerability and feels hope mixed with cautious tenderness as exclusion shifts toward inclusion. The passage foregrounds relational healing (recognition, value, belonging) more than immediate tactical concerns.

      Reader experience: The reader likely feels cathartic relief and uplift — a release after the attack and betrayal arcs — plus emotional satisfaction at a morally complex reconciliation that still retains restraint (no instant forgiveness). There's gratification at seeing group dynamics evolve from fracture to fragile repair.

      Beats and tone: There are two dominant emotional beats: (1) collective relief and proud satisfaction at having survived and acted together, and (2) the quieter, more delicate beat of trust-repair and inclusion (belonging/recognition) centered on Florence. The tone shifts from high-tension action toward restorative intimacy and moral complexity.

      Comparison to pattern so far: This continues the arc from dread→coordination→acceptance seen in the recent attack sequence but importantly advances the interpersonal arc (betrayal → tentative repair). Rather than repeating earlier procedural/frustration beats, it resolves some of the story's long-running betrayal/trust tension and deepens the belonging theme that has been building. The emotional pattern is evolving rather than merely repeating: threat has given way to communal repair and cautious hope.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="relief, hope">POV: Immediate, embodied relief and satisfied pride — Kira registers that the group 'won. together.' The physical and emotional exhaustion is tempered by a deeper sense of accomplishment and forward-looking possibility (we can rebuild). Cause: the successful defense, disposal of the command node, and surviving the coordinated fight. Reader: feels cathartic exhalation and uplift; the high-stakes tension resolves into rewarding relief and guarded optimism.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: A quieter, central beat of relational repair — Kira watches Florence move from exile toward being genuinely valued. She feels tender hope as Holloway, Runner, Velvet, Remedy, and others acknowledge Florence's role and invite her into recovery. Cause: explicit acknowledgments of value (shift from 'need' to 'value'), shared testimonies of contribution, and the offer to rest and remain in the common area. Reader: experiences warm satisfaction and emotional resolution; there's pride and relief at seeing trust begin to be rebuilt, while remaining aware that forgiveness is tentative and ongoing.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      Summary of approach: I compared the previous open-promises list to what actually happens in the passage and asked: did the passage (a) explicitly resolve a previously opened thread, (b) contradict or abandon a thread (lapse), or (c) reinforce / leave it open? I treated firm/explicit setups conservatively (only marking them fulfilled if the passage makes a clear decision or action resolving them) and retained most longer-running mysteries/plots (shuttle, coordinates, rescue timeline, etc.) as still relevant. I marked a few previously-open items as paid off because the passage contains an explicit social decision or an unambiguous demonstration of a previously-tentative capability. I did not mark as fulfilled anything that was merely reinforced but still ongoing.

      Why I marked what I did: 
      - FLORENCE_REINTEGRATION_DECISION: The earlier promise was that formal reintegration was pending. In this passage the group explicitly offers Florence inclusion in recovery and she accepts. That is a concrete, narratively significant decision toward reintegration (an offer and acceptance), so I treated this as fulfilled (initial reintegration step accomplished). The larger, formal political reintegration may remain, but the specific decision about joining the community recovery was made here.

      - TEAM_CAN_EXECUTE_COOPERATIVE_STRATEGIES_UNDER_PRESSURE (tentative): This was introduced tentatively in the previous passage after the tactical victory. Here the same group demonstrates coordinated, non-hierarchical recovery, mutual recognition, and repeated cooperative improvisation (battle then recovery conversation). The passage therefore fairly clearly pays off the tentative promise that this team can, in practice, coordinate creative strategies under stress. I mark it fulfilled but keep it labeled as a previously-tentative promise.

      - POSSIBLE_SOCIAL_FOUNDATION_FROM_VICTORY (tentative): The previous passage suggested the victory could seed a more durable social foundation. This passage shows the opening of that foundation: mutual acknowledgment, an invitation to join recovery, and a fragile acceptance. It's not a permanent social transformation, but it's a clear narrative payoff for the possibility introduced earlier, so I mark that tentative promise as paid off in its initial form.

      New promises: I recorded concrete, forward-facing setups introduced here: the immediate need for repair and resources (firm), the launching of a recovery phase that will demand resource collection/repair work (firm), and two softer character/community arcs seeded here: Florence beginning to believe in redemption and the recovery-gathering seeding community trust (both tentative). These are promises that the story is now set up to address next.

      Lapsed promises: I found no prior open promise that the passage explicitly contradicted or made irrelevant. Most earlier mysteries (shuttle coordinates, navigation failure, SAM, long-term rescue timeline, relocation pressure, etc.) remain live and narratively relevant (the group is depleted, repairs &amp; resources are needed, rescue timeline unchanged). So I did not mark any previously-open items as lapsed.

      If you want, I can (a) tighten the categorization further (e.g., split "reintegration" into 'social' vs 'formal political' tracks), or (b) mark additional tentatives as fulfilled or lapsed more aggressively depending on how narrowly you treat "decision vs. process."

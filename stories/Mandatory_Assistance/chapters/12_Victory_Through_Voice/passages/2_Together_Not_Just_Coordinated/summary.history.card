      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>The passage ends in the immediate aftermath of a coordinated attack that the defenders have just repelled. The hostile plants mounted multi-directional assaults (east, north, southwest/south, and a deliberately baited northwest false weak point). A massive hostile command root network surfaced through the facility's floor at the center of the defensive perimeter during the defenders' countermeasure; that command node was physically engaged—constricted by Velvet's barriers, severed by Runner, and flooded with Remedy's aggressive compounds—and has collapsed and is now withering in the central core. Hostile forces around the facility have lost coordination (bioluminescent signaling is cut off) and are withdrawing in a disorganized retreat. Physically, the facility has sustained additional acute damage from the underground surge and eruption: a new, large floor rupture where the command node surfaced, more structural stress/creaking, and localized debris from the erupting root mass. Velvet's layered barriers exist but are partially consumed/damaged and resource-depleted; the first-layer gaps and chemical trap zones have been used and are saturated with aggressive/withering chemicals (Remedy emptied most reserves in deployment). Runner and Velvet are injured and leaking sap/withering; Remedy is chemically exhausted; Holloway, Florence, and others are drained—Florence's wheeled platform is scorched/damaged. Kira and Scout remain in the central contracted core behind the defensive layers and evacuation routes remain mapped, but the immediate central area now contains the large, dead or dying hostile command-node biomass and chemical residue. Ambient conditions: toxic chemical residues and withering compounds in trap zones and soil, scorch marks, torn root debris, pervasive exhaustion among defenders, and temporary silence as the hostile coordination collapses.</reasoning>
        <state>The facility is in the immediate post-battle state: a large hostile command root network has surfaced through a newly ruptured central floor and now lies withered and collapsing inside the contracted defensive core; surrounding hostile forces are withdrawing and their bioluminescent coordination is offline. Velvet’s multi-layered barriers remain but are partially damaged and resource-depleted; chemical trap zones are active and saturated with aggressive/withering compounds but Remedy’s chemical reserves are essentially exhausted. Runner and Velvet are injured and leaking sap; Holloway, Florence (whose wheeled platform is scorched/damaged), Remedy, and other defenders are drained. Structural damage has increased (new central floor breach, more debris, continued ceiling/floor instability, scorch marks) and toxic/chemical residues and torn root debris litter the central and trap areas. Kira and Scout are alive and positioned in the central core behind remaining barrier layers; evacuation routes are mapped but the central area is clogged with the dead/dying command-node mass and contaminated ground.</state>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage stages and resolves the imminent test that the previous scene set up: the coordinated hostile attack arrives within the short readiness window and the team's layered‑barrier + concentrated chemical trap + underground decoy tactic is executed. The battle both validates several tactical setups (they were explicitly tested and paid off) and creates new, concrete consequences and vulnerabilities (severe depletion, injuries, a dead/dying central command node in the core) that generate fresh narrative stakes. I mark as fulfilled those prior open promises that were explicitly tested and resolved by the action sequence (short readiness window, layered defenses &amp; traps, and Runner's decoy). Nothing from the previous open list was obviously abandoned or dropped — the political, governance, resource, and trust questions remain live and are carried forward. The passage also introduces new, durable story promises tied to the immediate aftermath (post‑battle vulnerability, recovery needs, hostile adaptation to losing a command node, hazards/opportunities from the surfaced/withering command node, and the precedent of collective decision‑making), which should be tracked going forward.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="LAYERED_DEFENSE_AND_TRAPS_WILL_BE_TESTED">The layered barriers with deliberate gaps plus Remedy's concentrated chemical traps were explicitly tested during the attack; the traps and layered approach functioned as designed and were key to the defense.</promise>
          <promise id="SHORT_PREPARATION_WINDOW">The imminent ~20‑minute readiness window occurred and was the crucible for the plan; the hostile attack arrived within that short window and the team acted under that pressure.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMEDIATE_RESOURCE_CRITICAL_WINDOW">The immediate resource/time pressure was realized and resolved in combat—the team finished enough preparation in time (and then fought) so this acute window was expended/paid off.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_DECOY_EFFECTIVENESS">Runner's false weak point did attract and commit a large portion of hostile forces (working as intended), which allowed the team to attempt the decisive action on the command node—its effectiveness has been demonstrated (even if nearly overwhelming).</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">The hostile campaign remains an ongoing operational threat; the attack confirmed their sophistication and the campaign will continue in the future.</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_EXPERIMENTAL_LESSON">The team experimented with decentralized decision‑making and delegation under pressure; whether this becomes a sustained practice or institutional norm remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Florence made tactical contributions and shifted to collaborative coordination, improving her social position but not fully resolving her exile/betrayal consequences or formal reintegration.</promise>
          <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">Cohesion remains fragile despite the victory; the passage shows strengthened working trust but baseline social fractures and the risk of weakened long‑term governance persist.</promise>
          <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">The ethical/political question of accepting guidance with suspect provenance (Florence's past fabrications) remains unresolved despite tactical success.</promise>
          <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">Success in battle may bias the group toward judging guidance by outcomes rather than provenance; whether that becomes an explicit norm is still open.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">Florence contributed coordination but the new plan emerged collectively; how her individual contributions will be credited, recorded, or made accountable remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence's exile still exists as an institutional fact; the political ramifications of continued conditional assistance and partial reintegration are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The downstream effects and full scope of Florence's earlier fabrications have not been investigated and may still have operational or political consequences.</promise>
          <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Holloway's authority was tested and the group's emergent collective leadership dynamics complicate the post‑crisis stability of leadership norms.</promise>
          <promise id="TIME_PRESSURE_ON_TRUST_REPAIR">Trust was repaired under extreme, time‑compressed conditions; whether those repairs persist when the immediate crisis ends remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout continues as Kira's sentinel/emotional anchor; their role and resilience under continued siege and further demands remain consequential.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_WITHDRAWAL_IF_REJECTED">Florence previously signaled she could withdraw if not accepted; she stayed and acted—this conditional leverage remains a live political factor.</promise>
          <promise id="BEACON_REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_COMMS">External communications and beacon options remain unaddressed and are still critical contingencies for rescue or outside assistance.</promise>
          <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM's operational status and potential role were not revisited and remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">The passage resolves the immediate assault but not the need for a comprehensive long‑term survival plan (relocation, stockpiles, governance, repairs).</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Structural governance questions (authority, attribution, decision rules) remain unresolved despite the emergency consensus tactic proving effective.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_THREAT">Remedy, Velvet, and Runner were pushed to depletion/injury in the fight; resource exhaustion is now an acute, continuing threat to future defense and recovery.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_IMPACTS_DEFENSE">Runner's injury limited a solo approach and nearly cost the operation; their compromised condition remains a tactical vulnerability.</promise>
          <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">The facility sustained further damage in the assault and remains a long‑term habitability/logistics problem.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_DEFACTO_COMMAND_DURING_CRISIS">Florence remains the central tactical coordinator in crises but has shifted toward soliciting input; whether that role normalizes or is politically contested remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="EXTENDED_SIEGE_PREPARATION_AND_RECOVERY">Preparations for an extended siege and post‑battle recovery tasks remain incomplete and urgently required.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_CONTINUES_CONDITIONAL_ASSISTANCE">Florence acted on her conditional commitment to help Kira; the long‑term consequences and dependency this creates remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBLE_FOUNDATION_FOR_FORGIVENESS">The group's cooperative success creates a fragile foundation for future forgiveness or reconciliation, but this possibility is unproven.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP">Florence's move toward collaborative leadership was validated in battle; whether this becomes an enduring leadership model remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_CONCENTRATED_DEPLOYMENT_RECOVERY">Remedy's concentrated chemical approach proved effective in points but exhausted reserves; the sustainability and long‑term viability of this strategy are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_BUILDING_MOMENTUM">The victory significantly advanced nascent trust and working cooperation; whether that momentum endures past the immediate crisis is still an open promise.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMEDIATE_POST_BATTLE_VULNERABILITY_WINDOW">Newly introduced: the group is severely depleted, injured, and the facility is damaged—there is a narrow, immediate window of heightened vulnerability to follow‑up attacks or collapse that must be managed.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_ADAPTATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_LOSS">Newly introduced: with the command node destroyed the hostiles lost coordination now, but they are likely to adapt (decentralize, relocate command functions, or adopt new tactics), creating a future escalation risk.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_WITHERING_HAZARD">Newly introduced: the destroyed/withering command node now sits in the central core — it may contaminate the environment, pose biological hazards, or offer intelligence/opportunity if safely examined; its presence creates new stakes.</promise>
          <promise id="POST_BATTLE_RESOURCE_AND_MEDICAL_CRISIS">Newly introduced: immediate triage, medical care, chemical replenishment, and repair priorities are required—Remedy is chemically empty, Velvet and Runner are depleted or injured, and many systems are damaged.</promise>
          <promise id="COLLECTIVE_DECISIONMAKING_PRECEDENT">Newly introduced: the group's successful, collective tactical decision sets an explicit precedent for consensus‑driven problem solving; whether this becomes a durable governance practice or a temporary expedient is unresolved.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage establishes several durable operational and social facts that will matter in later scenes: the hostile plants are centrally coordinated by an underground command node (discovered and localized), defenders developed and executed a novel collective tactic (forcing the command node to surface) that succeeded, Runner actively took part in risky underground action despite injury, and the engagement produced a measurable increase in coordinated, non‑hierarchical decision-making and trust among the plant defenders (including a slight reintegration of Florence). These are not transient scene details but change the capabilities, tactics, and interpersonal dynamics available going forward. I found no contradictions with previously established facts; where prior facts suggested Runner was temporarily sidelined or Remedy had limited deployments, this passage shows the defenders used available resources and Runner returned to fight, which constitutes a state change rather than a conflict.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_COMMAND_NODE_DISCOVERED">Defenders (Runner) located a central hostile command node — a massive underground root network roughly 50 meters east that radiates bioluminescent signals to coordinate attacking plants; severing or destroying it disrupts the attackers' coordination.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENDERS_FORCED_COMMAND_NODE_SURFACE">Defenders executed a novel combined tactic: Velvet and Runner directed aggressive downward growth while Remedy supplied chemical accelerants/withering compounds to force the command node to surface into the defensive perimeter, enabling its collective destruction.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_PARTICIPATED_IN_OFFENSIVE_WHILE_INJURED">Runner, despite prior injuries and sap loss, actively conducted deep underground offensive maneuvers (attempting a solo approach, then contributing to the combined downward-growth tactic) and surfaced further torn and withering — a return to combat role under injury.</fact>
          <fact id="HOSTILES_ADAPTED_BETWEEN_ENGAGEMENTS">The hostile plants adapted tactics between engagements ("learned from yesterday"): probing multiple directions, testing perceived weak points, shifting attack vectors in real time, and anticipating defender maneuvers.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_COLLECTIVE_DECISIONMAKING_AND_TRUST_IN_BATTLE">The defenders shifted to genuine, rapid collective decision-making in combat (shared planning and improvisation rather than unilateral orders); this cooperative execution succeeded and produced a measurable increase in practical trust and partial social reintegration (Florence becomes less isolated though still separate).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Temporal cues in the text tie this passage tightly to the end of the previous passage. The previous passage ended with detection of hostiles and an explicit status check saying “we have twenty minutes until full readiness” and then “They’re coming.” The current passage opens, “The attack starts subtly,” and immediately describes the initial strikes (eastern, northern) and an underground surge. The passage includes short, explicit countdowns (Velvet begins in thirty seconds; Remedy deploys ten seconds after), rapid exchanges and the failed underground approach, followed almost immediately by a reorganized, cooperative gambit that forces the enemy command node to the surface and destroys it.

          Given those cues: the attack begins almost immediately after the previous passage’s close (minutes, not hours). The sequence contains many short actions that are described in seconds-to-minutes (the 30s/10s countdowns are explicit), and several phases that plausibly take minutes each (initial probes/assaults; Runner’s underground attempt and being forced back; regrouping and executing the combined downward growth; the floor eruption and final engagement). Taken together the battle reads as a single continuous event that lasts on the order of tens of minutes rather than hours. 

          There is one place where the timeline demands some suspension of disbelief: the rapidity of large-scale growth and the effectiveness of accelerants/chemicals to force a massive command node to surface. Within the story’s established speculative biology (plants already able to change barriers, regenerate, produce chemicals quickly under duress), that accelerated growth/chemical effect is consistent with earlier capabilities, but it is the most time-compressed element and would be the main potential stretch for realism. Other timings—the 30s/10s countdowns, the transition from failed solo approach to an all-in cooperative maneuver, the final coordinated attack—are all plausible within a 15–40 minute window.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>~10:05 (approx)</starts>
        <ends>~10:35 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>About 5–10 minutes. The previous passage ends with hostiles detected and readiness at ~20 minutes; the attack begins almost immediately after that warning, so there is little gap — only the brief interval needed for the first probes and immediate response.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible within the story’s speculative biology. The seconds/minutes cues (30s/10s countdowns, immediate responses) line up internally, and the sequence of probing, trap use, failed single-operator attempt, rapid regrouping and a combined gambit could reasonably play out over ~15–35 minutes. The primary timing stretch is the very fast, large-scale downward growth and forced surfacing of the command node; this requires that accelerants and combined plant effort massively speed growth in minutes rather than hours. Given the narrative has already established accelerated chemical/biological responses, that remains an acceptable, if somewhat strained, element of suspension of disbelief.</plausibility>

      <characters>
        <reasoning>I read the passage and identified every named character who appears or speaks. Florence, Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Holloway, Scout, and the first-person narrator (Kira, referred to as “I”) are all explicitly present and active in the scene. No new named characters arrive during this passage — everyone named was already present at the start — so the ENTERED list is empty. Likewise, no named characters leave the scene before it ends, so the EXITED list is empty. The scene takes place in/around the facility on the planet, so I included the provided planetary entity as the relevant location.</reasoning>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage stages and pays off the imminent attack that previous setup promised: the hostile plants escalate and coordinate (bioluminescent signaling), the group's layered/trap defenses and Runner's misdirection are tested, and a novel collective offensive (forcing the command node to surface) is executed. Many tactical setups introduced earlier are executed and resolved in the immediate battle (so they are marked as fulfilled). However, strategic and social threads remain unresolved and are carried forward: long-term trust/reintegration, resource exhaustion and recovery, infrastructure/relocation choices, motivations of the hostiles, and the longer-term consequences of destroying the command node (will the enemy adapt?). I mark as fulfilled those prior open promises that were directly tested and paid off in this passage (imminent attack occurs; layered defenses, Runner's misdirection, Remedy's focused deployment, Florence's collaborative leadership and trust-as-strategy are shown effective; the hostile network/command node is located and neutralized). I carry forward most systemic and longer-term risks (resource depletion, injuries, repair vs relocate, institutional/bureaucratic fallout, motivations) plus new promises introduced by the battle's aftermath (e.g., whether destroying the command node produces a lasting strategic advantage or causes enemy adaptation, whether the group can replicate coordinated offensive tactics, and whether Remedy/Runner/Velvet recover). No substantial prior promise is clearly abandoned/moot—the important unresolved structural and social promises remain relevant—so the Lapsed list is empty.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM">The predicted adaptive, coordinated hostile assault occurred immediately and was tested—an organized multi-directional attack happened and was repelled in this engagement (command node destroyed).</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">The nascent cooperation demonstrably improved defensive effectiveness — collective improvisation and mutual trust were decisive in winning the battle.</promise>
          <promise id="INTRA_COMMUNITY_VALIDATION">Florence's competence and the group's tactical choices received concrete validation: the group's coordinated actions produced victory, strengthening de facto validation of leadership and methods.</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">The hostile bioluminescent/networked communications were mapped and targeted—the command node was located underground and a specific countermeasure (force it up) was executed.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILES_NETWORK_ADVANTAGE">The attackers' networked coordination (their main tactical advantage) was neutralized when the central command node was forced to surface and destroyed, breaking coordinated assaults.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_FLORENCE_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP">Florence's shift to soliciting input and integrating others' plans was tested in combat and shown to be effective as a collaborative leadership model in practice.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_LAYERED_DEFENSE_STRATEGY">Velvet's layered barriers with deliberate gaps (paired with chemical traps) were tested and functioned as intended to slow and channel attackers.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_RUNNER_MISDIRECTION_PLAN">Runner's false weak point (northwest) succeeded in drawing enemy forces and shaping the battle, even though it nearly overwhelmed the trap.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_FOCUSED_DEPLOYMENT">Remedy's concentrated chemical trap deployments were effective at stopping assaults in chosen gaps and later provided cover during the offensive gambit.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TIME_PRESSURE_ATTACK_IMMINENCE">The immediate-time threat forecast was correct: attack arrived within minutes and the group had to execute under severe time pressure.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TRUST_AS_STRATEGIC_DECISION">Trust was explicitly invoked as a tactical variable and held under fire, enabling decentralized decision-making and the final coordinated solution.</promise>
          <promise id="OVERNIGHT_VULNERABILITY_WINDOW">The vulnerability window (attack while preparations incomplete) occurred and was survived—the group endured the immediate vulnerability period through their layered response and improvisation.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy's gamble to concentrate resources produced tangible consequences: the traps worked but Remedy exhausted its reserves and is left critically depleted.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">Florence's initial moves toward collaboration opened a path to reintegration; the passage shows trust-building steps but the timeline and full reintegration remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence is less isolated and has shown tactical humility, but whether this becomes lasting social reintegration or a temporary tactic remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">The deeper goals, thresholds for negotiation, and ideological drivers of the hostile plants remain unexplored despite tactical defeat—motivation is still unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">Infrastructure damage, resource depletion, and injuries are worse after the battle; the community remains brittle and at risk of degradation despite this victory.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Territorial rituals and boundary authority were not resolved by the battle; their post-crisis role and enforcement remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">The significance and future escalation logic of enemy territorial marking were not settled by this battle and remain relevant for strategy.</promise>
          <promise id="EXTERNAL_RELOCATION_PRESSURE">Damage and resource loss increase pressure to repair or relocate; the strategic choice remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Institutional and interpersonal trust erosion persists; while tactical cooperation improved, broader political consequences are still undecided.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">Care and maintenance routines remain strained by injuries and resource limits; who will sustain these routines is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy contributed decisively but is emotionally and materially exhausted—whether they can continue in their role is uncertain.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal rituals around boundary control remain under strain and unresolved after the assault.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's dependence on plant allies remains an operational and narrative vulnerability; the consequences of those attachments remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Securing long-term shelter, supplies, and a sustainable plan (repair vs relocate vs signal for rescue) remains pressing and unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Critical shortages (chemicals, growth resources, medical capacity) intensified by the battle remain an urgent unresolved problem.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Questions about elder communications and possible deception were not addressed in the battle and remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The role of rituals, bureaucracy, and formal protocol versus emergency improvisation remains unsettled after this ad-hoc victory.</promise>
          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Communications repair, water/medical continuity, and structural fixes are outstanding technical/logistical problems requiring resources and decisions.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">The facility is more damaged and resources more depleted after the fight; repair or relocation is now more urgent.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner was unable to solo the command node and surfaced badly injured; their longer-term operability and recovery remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="CHEMICAL_NEUTRALIZATION_SECONDARY_HAZARD">Toxic residues and side-effects from chemical use remain an environmental and health risk and need addressing.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_DEPLETION_CRISIS">Remedy is effectively emptied of defensive chemicals after the engagement; whether Remedy can recover production capacity is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_SUSTAINABILITY_FAILURE">Velvet expended massive growth resources to bait and restrain the node; long-term sustainability under continued assault is still at risk.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner's injuries limited their effectiveness and will constrain future underground operations until they recover.</promise>
          <promise id="INFRASTRUCTURE_REPAIR_OR_RELOCATE_DECISION_IMMINENT">Given increased damage and depleted supplies, the decision whether to repair the facility or relocate remains an urgent open strategic question.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_ISOLATION_PERSISTENCE">Florence is less remote and more collaborative, but full social acceptance and forgiveness remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_KIRA_EMERGENCY_EVACUATION_ROUTINE">Holloway's evacuation plan for Kira was prepared and stood ready; it wasn't needed but remains an important contingency to test later.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_TARGET_SOUTHWEST_LIFE_SUPPORT">Intelligence previously indicated southwest life-support was a likely target; that location was not the decisive front in this battle and remains a high-stakes vulnerability to defend in future attacks.</promise>
          <promise id="NEW_REMEDY_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION_CONSEQUENCE">Remedy's focused allocation created short-term success but also a critical after-action depletion that will affect future defenses; recovery consequences remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMAND_NODE_AFTERMATH_AND_COUNTERADAPTATION">The immediate neutralization of the enemy command node removed coordination, but whether the hostile plants will adapt (decentralize, create new nodes, or change tactics) is unknown and now a central future threat.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_OFFENSIVE_TACTIC_POTENTIAL">The group's combined offensive (forcing the command node to surface) demonstrated a new tactic—whether they can repeat, refine, or scale this offensive capability is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_RECOVERY_AND_CAPACITY">After full depletion during the fight, Remedy's ability to recover chemical reserves and resume defensive/medical production is uncertain and strategically critical.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_CRITICAL_INJURY_RISK">Runner surfaced badly damaged after the attempt; their survival, long-term recovery, and operational consequences are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="AFTERMATH_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_REPAIR">The post-battle structural damage and resource losses create immediate repair needs and may force relocation; the group's capacity to repair and the timeline are open.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_LEADS_TO_SOCIAL_REINTEGRATION">Battle-forged trust is now a promising seed for longer-term social reintegration and political healing, but whether it translates into durable forgiveness or institutional change remains to be tested.</promise>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage documents several durable, story-relevant state changes beyond the immediate scene: discovery and physical location of a hostile command node, its destruction and the resulting loss of coordination among attacking plants, and the attendant depletion/damage to the facility and key defenders. These items matter for future scenes because they change the enemy's capabilities (central controller destroyed), alter the defenders' resource state (Remedy chemically empty, Velvet/Runner further depleted/injured, Florence's platform damaged), and mark a clear turning point in group dynamics (a successful, collective improvisation that materially increases operational trust). I omitted transient/sensory details and routine battlefield beats. I flagged no contradictions with previously established facts — the new facts mostly update or resolve previous expectations (e.g., earlier assumptions that hostiles would regroup/return are now revised by the destruction of their command node).</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_COMMAND_NODE_DISCOVERED_LOCATION_50M_EAST">Defenders identified a large hostile command node underground roughly fifty meters east of the facility; it was radiating bioluminescent coordination signals to attacking plants.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_COMMAND_NODE_DESTROYED">The hostile command node surfaced into the facility perimeter during a coordinated defensive maneuver and was attacked and collapsed/destroyed by combined efforts of Velvet, Runner, Remedy, Holloway and others.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILES_LOSE_COORDINATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_DESTROYED">With the central command node destroyed, the attacking plants immediately lost coordinated control; bioluminescent signaling ceased and assault forces withdrew in an uncoordinated manner.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CHEMICALS_FULLY_EXPENDED">Remedy deployed essentially all remaining aggressive and accelerant chemical resources during the battle and is left chemically empty/exhausted after the engagement.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_INJURY_WORSENED">Runner surfaced torn, leaking, and further injured during this engagement; their condition is worsened and they contributed despite being compromised.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_SEVERELY_DEPLETED_AND_WITHERED">Velvet redirected major growth reserves, became resource-depleted and withered from the exertion of diversion and later constriction during the fight.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PLATFORM_DAMAGED">Florence's wheeled mobility platform was scorched/damaged during the battle and shows signs of wear from sustained coordination efforts.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_COLLECTIVE_IMPROVISATION_SUCCESSFUL">A spontaneously improvised, collective strategy (coordinated downward growth by Velvet/Runner plus chemical support and simultaneous perimeter actions) succeeded in neutralizing the enemy's command node, strengthening the group's confidence in cooperative decision-making and operational trust.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_DAMAGED_BUT_CORE_HOLDING_POST_BATTLE">After the engagement the facility remains structurally damaged and depleted (defenses and supplies worn) but the core defensive perimeter is still holding.</fact>

      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues: the previous passage sets the scene in mid-morning and ends with Florence announcing “We have twenty minutes until full readiness” and Runner detecting hostile movement—"They're coming." The current passage opens with the attack beginning and ends with the hostile command node destroyed and the attackers withdrawing. The sequence of events (initial probe, multiple directional assaults, Runner's solo underground attempt, failed approach, rapid regroup and combined downward growth, command node surfacing, and destruction) all occur in one continuous combat episode immediately following the detection. Given the prior “twenty minutes” warning and the immediate "They're coming" detection, the current passage is an immediate continuation and plausibly occupies on the order of tens of minutes (not hours).</reasoning>
        <starts>~10:50 (mid-morning; immediate start after the prior detection)</starts>
        <ends>~11:10 (mid-morning; roughly 20 minutes after the attack began)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The attack begins right after Runner's detection and Florence's warning (the passage picks up without a meaningful time gap).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible within the story's internal logic. The timeline is tight but consistent: Florence gave a ~20-minute readiness window before the attack, the assault begins almost immediately, and the battle plays out over roughly twenty minutes. The plants' abilities (rapid growth, chemical deployment, underground movement, and use of accelerants) have already been established, so quick repositioning, a short solo underground probe, a rapid failure, and an improvised combined countermeasure that forces the command node to surface fit the story's biological/technological rules. Potentially demanding elements (bringing a large command node to the surface in minutes) are the only place where real-world biological pacing would strain plausibility, but the narrative already uses accelerated growth/chemistry as functional tools, so this remains internally consistent. No explicit timing contradiction with the previous passage was found.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>All named characters in the passage are the same set who were present at the end of the previous passage. The passage explicitly mentions Florence, Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Holloway, Scout, and the first-person narrator (Kira Voss). Buddy was listed as present at the end of the previous passage and the scene repeatedly refers to “everyone” moving and later surveys the group, so Buddy is treated as present throughout though not individually named in this passage. No new characters enter during this passage, and no characters leave before the end—everyone who was present at the start remains by the passage's end (though injured/depleted). The passage refers to a damaged facility and underground areas but does not name any specific location or entity from the provided entity list, so no entities are included.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>Passage shows the defenders' planned layered defense put to the test, a series of coordinated assaults, a failed solo attempt to sever the enemy command node, and then a collective gambit that forced the command node to surface and be destroyed. I added bullets for the sequence of attacks (east neutralized by Remedy, north stalled, northwest false weakness overcommitted), Runner's failed solo underground attempt, the group's decision to force the command node upward (Velvet+Runner downward growth, Remedy chemicals, Holloway protecting Kira), and the destruction of the command node leading to the attackers losing coordination and withdrawing. I consolidated or removed now-irrelevant operational minutiae (e.g., Velvet's exact % completion, earlier estimates of time to readiness) and merged prior leadership/context bullets (Florence's confession and her shift to collaboration) into fewer, plot-relevant lines. I updated character/resource statuses to reflect depletion and injuries described in this passage (Runner torn/leaking, Velvet withered/depleted, Remedy chemically exhausted, facility badly damaged but defenses holding and core systems intact). I kept the chronology clear and focused on events that will matter going forward: the command node's destruction, the group's demonstrated ability to improvise and trust, and the defenders' battered condition.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal perimeter scout and stays close to Kira in the central core.
          - Florence publicly confessed fabricating Elder Twist's pronouncements and was initially isolated and distrusted; she remains tactical coordinator but has shifted toward genuine collaboration with the group.
          - Hostile plants labeled Kira “contamination” and launched a coordinated multi-pronged assault that breached outer sections; defenders contracted to a defensible core and stabilized.
          - Defenders implemented a layered defense (Runner underground misdirection/monitoring, Velvet multilayer barriers, Remedy chemical traps); early exchanges caused injuries and resource depletion but bought time.
          - New coordinated attack began: bioluminescent signaling united hostile forces; eastern assault punched through the first barrier and was neutralized by Remedy's chemical trap.
          - Northern approach was stalled by Velvet's barriers and Runner severing roots; hostiles probed multiple directions to find weaknesses.
          - Hostiles exploited the prepared northwest false weakness and committed overwhelming forces; the trap began to fail and simultaneous southern pressure started, surrounding the defenders.
          - Runner attempted a solo underground approach to sever a suspected command node but was intercepted and could not reach it; Runner surfaced badly torn and leaking.
          - Group decision to act collectively: Velvet and Runner combined downward growth toward the command node location while Remedy supplied growth accelerants and withering compounds and Holloway prepared to protect Kira and the core.
          - The combined effort forced a massive hostile command node to surface inside the facility's defensive perimeter; defenders attacked in unison (Velvet constriction, Runner severing, Remedy dissolution, Holloway blocking).
          - The hostile command node was destroyed; bioluminescent coordination signals cut off and attacking plants lost cohesion and withdrew.
          - Aftermath: attackers retreated; the facility is heavily damaged but defenses are holding and core life-support/medical systems remain intact; defenders are exhausted and depleted (Runner severely injured/leaking, Velvet withered/depleted, Remedy's chemical reserves exhausted, Holloway drained).
          - Group dynamics: the team improvised a solution together, demonstrating practical trust and collaboration; Florence is less isolated and acknowledges the group's collective effectiveness, marking fragile but significant progress.

      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV emotional state: The narrator (Kira) cycles from high alert and anxiety into a surprising, scared-but-energized empowerment, then into exhausted relief. At first she’s tense and nervous because the hostile plants have learned and are coordinating—the assault is immediate, multi-directional, and the facility trembles. That anxiety is amplified by Runner’s injury and the apparent failure of Florence’s initial tactic. When the group improvises a collective plan and everyone contributes, Kira experiences an empowering lift: fear remains, but it's reshaped into active agency and fragile trust as the group acts together. After the command node is forced up and destroyed she feels relieved, proud, and quietly moved by the emergent cooperation. Reader experience: The passage is designed to put the reader through a rollercoaster of suspense (real, close danger) into tactical exhilaration (the clever gambit) and cathartic release (victory and the emotional repair). There are multiple beats rather than a single tone: acute tension/dread, then an empowerment/belonging surge, and finally relief/acceptance. Compared to the story so far, this continues the recurring threat→coordination→acceptance arc but importantly reframes it: earlier sequences emphasized fractured trust, Florence’s authority, and paralysis; here the group shifts from relying on a single planner to collective improvisation. Emotionally, the pattern is familiar (danger then teamwork) but it advances the arc by converting lingering betrayal into pragmatic, trust-based cooperation—so the repetition serves growth rather than redundancy.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="tension, dread">POV: Immediate alarm and fear as the attack begins—bioluminescent coordination, multiple assaults, and Runner's injury create acute danger; Kira is watching, physically tense and worried (Scout pressed to her). Reader: Feels breathless suspense and anxiety, keyed to concrete sensory details (shuddering facility, failed barriers, Runner's torn vines). This is a continuation of the story's established high-stakes threat beats.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: A surge of fearful-but-energized hope as the group improvises a collective strategy—Kira feels empowered by being part of a shared decision and witnesses plants coordinating in a new, cooperative way; this produces a fragile sense of belonging despite previous betrayals. Reader: Experiences uplifted engagement and moral satisfaction as disparate characters contribute and trust one another enough to attempt a risky, collaborative gambit. This beat shifts the recurring pattern from fractured command to emergent teamwork.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, acceptance">POV: Exhausted, stunned relief and weary acceptance after the command node is destroyed—the immediate danger is over, bodies and systems are wrecked, and Kira registers the small, imperfect repair of trust ('we can work together'). Reader: Feels cathartic release and warm satisfaction at the victory and the emotional payoff (partial reconciliation and genuine cooperation). Pattern note: The passage resolves tension in a familiar way but with a meaningful emotional advance—trust rebuilt enough to act together—preventing the sequence from feeling merely repetitive.</beat>

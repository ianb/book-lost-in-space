  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage documents several durable, story-relevant state changes beyond the immediate scene: discovery and physical location of a hostile command node, its destruction and the resulting loss of coordination among attacking plants, and the attendant depletion/damage to the facility and key defenders. These items matter for future scenes because they change the enemy's capabilities (central controller destroyed), alter the defenders' resource state (Remedy chemically empty, Velvet/Runner further depleted/injured, Florence's platform damaged), and mark a clear turning point in group dynamics (a successful, collective improvisation that materially increases operational trust). I omitted transient/sensory details and routine battlefield beats. I flagged no contradictions with previously established facts — the new facts mostly update or resolve previous expectations (e.g., earlier assumptions that hostiles would regroup/return are now revised by the destruction of their command node).</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_COMMAND_NODE_DISCOVERED_LOCATION_50M_EAST">Defenders identified a large hostile command node underground roughly fifty meters east of the facility; it was radiating bioluminescent coordination signals to attacking plants.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_COMMAND_NODE_DESTROYED">The hostile command node surfaced into the facility perimeter during a coordinated defensive maneuver and was attacked and collapsed/destroyed by combined efforts of Velvet, Runner, Remedy, Holloway and others.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILES_LOSE_COORDINATION_AFTER_COMMAND_NODE_DESTROYED">With the central command node destroyed, the attacking plants immediately lost coordinated control; bioluminescent signaling ceased and assault forces withdrew in an uncoordinated manner.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CHEMICALS_FULLY_EXPENDED">Remedy deployed essentially all remaining aggressive and accelerant chemical resources during the battle and is left chemically empty/exhausted after the engagement.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_INJURY_WORSENED">Runner surfaced torn, leaking, and further injured during this engagement; their condition is worsened and they contributed despite being compromised.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_SEVERELY_DEPLETED_AND_WITHERED">Velvet redirected major growth reserves, became resource-depleted and withered from the exertion of diversion and later constriction during the fight.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PLATFORM_DAMAGED">Florence's wheeled mobility platform was scorched/damaged during the battle and shows signs of wear from sustained coordination efforts.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_COLLECTIVE_IMPROVISATION_SUCCESSFUL">A spontaneously improvised, collective strategy (coordinated downward growth by Velvet/Runner plus chemical support and simultaneous perimeter actions) succeeded in neutralizing the enemy's command node, strengthening the group's confidence in cooperative decision-making and operational trust.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_DAMAGED_BUT_CORE_HOLDING_POST_BATTLE">After the engagement the facility remains structurally damaged and depleted (defenses and supplies worn) but the core defensive perimeter is still holding.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: the previous passage sets the scene in mid-morning and ends with Florence announcing “We have twenty minutes until full readiness” and Runner detecting hostile movement—"They're coming." The current passage opens with the attack beginning and ends with the hostile command node destroyed and the attackers withdrawing. The sequence of events (initial probe, multiple directional assaults, Runner's solo underground attempt, failed approach, rapid regroup and combined downward growth, command node surfacing, and destruction) all occur in one continuous combat episode immediately following the detection. Given the prior “twenty minutes” warning and the immediate "They're coming" detection, the current passage is an immediate continuation and plausibly occupies on the order of tens of minutes (not hours).</reasoning>
    <starts>~10:50 (mid-morning; immediate start after the prior detection)</starts>
    <ends>~11:10 (mid-morning; roughly 20 minutes after the attack began)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The attack begins right after Runner's detection and Florence's warning (the passage picks up without a meaningful time gap).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible within the story's internal logic. The timeline is tight but consistent: Florence gave a ~20-minute readiness window before the attack, the assault begins almost immediately, and the battle plays out over roughly twenty minutes. The plants' abilities (rapid growth, chemical deployment, underground movement, and use of accelerants) have already been established, so quick repositioning, a short solo underground probe, a rapid failure, and an improvised combined countermeasure that forces the command node to surface fit the story's biological/technological rules. Potentially demanding elements (bringing a large command node to the surface in minutes) are the only place where real-world biological pacing would strain plausibility, but the narrative already uses accelerated growth/chemistry as functional tools, so this remains internally consistent. No explicit timing contradiction with the previous passage was found.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>All named characters in the passage are the same set who were present at the end of the previous passage. The passage explicitly mentions Florence, Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Holloway, Scout, and the first-person narrator (Kira Voss). Buddy was listed as present at the end of the previous passage and the scene repeatedly refers to “everyone” moving and later surveys the group, so Buddy is treated as present throughout though not individually named in this passage. No new characters enter during this passage, and no characters leave before the end—everyone who was present at the start remains by the passage's end (though injured/depleted). The passage refers to a damaged facility and underground areas but does not name any specific location or entity from the provided entity list, so no entities are included.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>Passage shows the defenders' planned layered defense put to the test, a series of coordinated assaults, a failed solo attempt to sever the enemy command node, and then a collective gambit that forced the command node to surface and be destroyed. I added bullets for the sequence of attacks (east neutralized by Remedy, north stalled, northwest false weakness overcommitted), Runner's failed solo underground attempt, the group's decision to force the command node upward (Velvet+Runner downward growth, Remedy chemicals, Holloway protecting Kira), and the destruction of the command node leading to the attackers losing coordination and withdrawing. I consolidated or removed now-irrelevant operational minutiae (e.g., Velvet's exact % completion, earlier estimates of time to readiness) and merged prior leadership/context bullets (Florence's confession and her shift to collaboration) into fewer, plot-relevant lines. I updated character/resource statuses to reflect depletion and injuries described in this passage (Runner torn/leaking, Velvet withered/depleted, Remedy chemically exhausted, facility badly damaged but defenses holding and core systems intact). I kept the chronology clear and focused on events that will matter going forward: the command node's destruction, the group's demonstrated ability to improvise and trust, and the defenders' battered condition.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a loyal perimeter scout and stays close to Kira in the central core.
      - Florence publicly confessed fabricating Elder Twist's pronouncements and was initially isolated and distrusted; she remains tactical coordinator but has shifted toward genuine collaboration with the group.
      - Hostile plants labeled Kira “contamination” and launched a coordinated multi-pronged assault that breached outer sections; defenders contracted to a defensible core and stabilized.
      - Defenders implemented a layered defense (Runner underground misdirection/monitoring, Velvet multilayer barriers, Remedy chemical traps); early exchanges caused injuries and resource depletion but bought time.
      - New coordinated attack began: bioluminescent signaling united hostile forces; eastern assault punched through the first barrier and was neutralized by Remedy's chemical trap.
      - Northern approach was stalled by Velvet's barriers and Runner severing roots; hostiles probed multiple directions to find weaknesses.
      - Hostiles exploited the prepared northwest false weakness and committed overwhelming forces; the trap began to fail and simultaneous southern pressure started, surrounding the defenders.
      - Runner attempted a solo underground approach to sever a suspected command node but was intercepted and could not reach it; Runner surfaced badly torn and leaking.
      - Group decision to act collectively: Velvet and Runner combined downward growth toward the command node location while Remedy supplied growth accelerants and withering compounds and Holloway prepared to protect Kira and the core.
      - The combined effort forced a massive hostile command node to surface inside the facility's defensive perimeter; defenders attacked in unison (Velvet constriction, Runner severing, Remedy dissolution, Holloway blocking).
      - The hostile command node was destroyed; bioluminescent coordination signals cut off and attacking plants lost cohesion and withdrew.
      - Aftermath: attackers retreated; the facility is heavily damaged but defenses are holding and core life-support/medical systems remain intact; defenders are exhausted and depleted (Runner severely injured/leaking, Velvet withered/depleted, Remedy's chemical reserves exhausted, Holloway drained).
      - Group dynamics: the team improvised a solution together, demonstrating practical trust and collaboration; Florence is less isolated and acknowledges the group's collective effectiveness, marking fragile but significant progress.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV emotional state: The narrator (Kira) cycles from high alert and anxiety into a surprising, scared-but-energized empowerment, then into exhausted relief. At first she’s tense and nervous because the hostile plants have learned and are coordinating—the assault is immediate, multi-directional, and the facility trembles. That anxiety is amplified by Runner’s injury and the apparent failure of Florence’s initial tactic. When the group improvises a collective plan and everyone contributes, Kira experiences an empowering lift: fear remains, but it's reshaped into active agency and fragile trust as the group acts together. After the command node is forced up and destroyed she feels relieved, proud, and quietly moved by the emergent cooperation. Reader experience: The passage is designed to put the reader through a rollercoaster of suspense (real, close danger) into tactical exhilaration (the clever gambit) and cathartic release (victory and the emotional repair). There are multiple beats rather than a single tone: acute tension/dread, then an empowerment/belonging surge, and finally relief/acceptance. Compared to the story so far, this continues the recurring threat→coordination→acceptance arc but importantly reframes it: earlier sequences emphasized fractured trust, Florence’s authority, and paralysis; here the group shifts from relying on a single planner to collective improvisation. Emotionally, the pattern is familiar (danger then teamwork) but it advances the arc by converting lingering betrayal into pragmatic, trust-based cooperation—so the repetition serves growth rather than redundancy.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="tension, dread">POV: Immediate alarm and fear as the attack begins—bioluminescent coordination, multiple assaults, and Runner's injury create acute danger; Kira is watching, physically tense and worried (Scout pressed to her). Reader: Feels breathless suspense and anxiety, keyed to concrete sensory details (shuddering facility, failed barriers, Runner's torn vines). This is a continuation of the story's established high-stakes threat beats.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: A surge of fearful-but-energized hope as the group improvises a collective strategy—Kira feels empowered by being part of a shared decision and witnesses plants coordinating in a new, cooperative way; this produces a fragile sense of belonging despite previous betrayals. Reader: Experiences uplifted engagement and moral satisfaction as disparate characters contribute and trust one another enough to attempt a risky, collaborative gambit. This beat shifts the recurring pattern from fractured command to emergent teamwork.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, acceptance">POV: Exhausted, stunned relief and weary acceptance after the command node is destroyed—the immediate danger is over, bodies and systems are wrecked, and Kira registers the small, imperfect repair of trust ('we can work together'). Reader: Feels cathartic release and warm satisfaction at the victory and the emotional payoff (partial reconciliation and genuine cooperation). Pattern note: The passage resolves tension in a familiar way but with a meaningful emotional advance—trust rebuilt enough to act together—preventing the sequence from feeling merely repetitive.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      This passage stages and executes the layered-defense plan from the previous passage, tests Florence's new collaborative leadership in combat, and decisively resolves the immediate tactical threat by locating and destroying the hostile command node. Fulfilled promises are mostly tactical setups from the prior passage that were executed in battle; several ongoing, structural, and character-arc promises remain open because the victory is temporary and many larger mysteries and survival problems are unresolved. A few tentative, older hints that were not reinforced have lapsed. I treated promises that were explicitly enacted in this passage (defensive layers, decoy, chemical traps, etc.) as fulfilled. I treated ongoing strategic/setting mysteries (crash coordinates, navigation failure, SAM fate, long-term survival, rescue timeline, resource depletion, social reintegration questions) as still open. Two older tentative threads that received no reinforcement in this or recent passages were allowed to lapse.

      Decisions and rationales in brief:
      - Tactical promises introduced last passage (layered defenses, Runner decoy, Remedy traps, Velvet layers, Holloway evacuation posture, imminent attack timer) were executed in this passage and thus counted as fulfilled (even when partially strained or nearly failing). They were explicitly listed in the previous open promises and paid off here.
      - The group's tentative move from necessity-based coordination toward true collaboration (GROUP_TRUST_BEGINNING / LOCAL_COOPERATION_FRAMEWORK / FLORENCE_COLLABORATIVE_LEADERSHIP) was tested and successfully used under fire. I mark the specific tentative "beginning of trust" promise as fulfilled; Florence's collaborative leadership (also newly introduced earlier) is realized in action and thus paid off in its immediate test. Larger social/identity questions (Florence reintegration, scope of fabrication investigation, long-term acceptance) remain open because this battle is only one step.
      - Big setting mysteries about the shuttle crash, navigation failure, SAM, and rescue timeline are unchanged by this battle and remain relevant, so they are carried forward.
      - Resource depletion was both predicted earlier and vividly confirmed here; it remains an urgent unresolved constraint and thus is carried forward as open rather than fulfilled.
      - Two older tentative hints that received no reinforcement in many passages were allowed to lapse because the story has focused tightly on immediate survival and group dynamics: MAINTAINED_FOREST_HINT (old, tentative, not reinforced) and KIRA_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE (tentative plan introduced earlier but not referenced or reinforced here).

      Notes on new promises: I omitted any new promise that was both introduced and resolved inside this single passage (for example, the discovery and destruction of the hostile command node and the combined upward/underground gambit) per the instruction. I did include new, forward-looking promises that survive this passage: that hostiles will regroup later and the broader, tentative promise that this victory could seed a more durable social foundation and team capability under pressure.

      <promise id="FLORENCE_REINTEGRATION_DECISION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Formal decision whether Florence will be fully reintegrated or remain exiled is still pending; this battle helped but did not settle it.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOPE_OF_FABRICATION_INVESTIGATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Which past guidance was Elder-authoritative vs. Florence's fabrication remains under investigation and untouched by this battle.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_ARC" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's arc (authority-without-Elder identity) continues; the passage advanced her collaborative side but the broader identity question remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_RETREAT_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="32">Florence's conditional promise to withdraw if rejected persists as a social constraint—she remains engaged but not permanently secure.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_IMMINENT" tentative="false" introduced="34">Key defenders' resources were confirmed as exhausted or near-exhaustion in the battle (Remedy empty, Velvet drained, Runner injured), making recovery and supply a pressing unresolved problem.</promise>
      <promise id="EXPECT_EXTENDED_SIEGE" tentative="false" introduced="34">Florence's forecast to prepare for an extended siege is still relevant: the command node's destruction bought a reprieve but did not eliminate longer-term siege risk.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_SOCIAL_FOUNDATION_FROM_NECESSITY_COOPERATION" tentative="true" introduced="34">The idea that necessity-based cooperation might create a lasting social foundation was reinforced by the battle; it's still tentative and unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILES_WILL_REGROUP" tentative="false" introduced="36">Newly explicit in this passage: Florence notes the attackers will regroup later—so destroying the command node gives temporary respite but not permanent safety.</promise>
      <promise id="TEAM_CAN_EXECUTE_COOPERATIVE_STRATEGIES_UNDER_PRESSURE" tentative="true" introduced="36">Newly suggested by the group's success: they demonstrated coordinated improvisation under fire; whether that capability holds in future crises is tentative and unproven.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_SOCIAL_FOUNDATION_FROM_VICTORY" tentative="true" introduced="36">A new, tentative promise: this specific victory could seed more durable trust/social foundation among the group if followed up; it's hopeful but unproven.</promise>

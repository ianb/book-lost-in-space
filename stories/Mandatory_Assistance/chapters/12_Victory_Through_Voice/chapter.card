<chapter version="1.1.0" number="12" name="Victory Through Voice">
  <summary>
    The attack continues. Under pressure, authentic voices emerge - plants communicate beyond HR-speak, respond to actual needs rather than procedures. Sweetpea's terrifying defensive features become literal protection as Kira shelters within her thorny form. Scout's non-verbal communication coordinates defense. Florence speaks tactical wisdom in her own voice and is heard. Runner's touch-perception detects threats. They defeat the hostile plants through genuine teamwork - messy, improvised, nothing like the manual says. Victory through being themselves.

    Authentic voices emerging under pressure. The payoff of genuine connection built through all their fumbling learning. Each plant's unique capabilities as strengths, not quirks to manage. Earned cooperation. Catharsis.

    <chapter version="1.0.0" number="12" name="Victory Through Voice">
      <reasoning-chapter>
        Act 3 climax and resolution. Victory through genuine cooperation, not bureaucracy. Each plant's authentic voice emerges under pressure. Sweetpea becomes sanctuary during the assault - her thorns aren't flaws but protective features. Scout's non-verbal communication proves crucial. Florence's tactical wisdom is valued directly, not through Elder Twist. They win by being themselves.

      <summary>
        The attack continues. Under pressure, authentic voices emerge - plants communicate beyond HR-speak, respond to actual needs rather than procedures. Sweetpea's terrifying defensive features become literal protection as Kira shelters within her thorny form. Scout's non-verbal communication coordinates defense. Florence speaks tactical wisdom in her own voice and is heard. Runner's touch-perception detects threats. They defeat the hostile plants through genuine teamwork - messy, improvised, nothing like the manual says. Victory through being themselves.
      </summary>
      <focus>
        Authentic voices emerging under pressure. The payoff of genuine connection built through all their fumbling learning. Each plant's unique capabilities as strengths, not quirks to manage. Earned cooperation. Catharsis.

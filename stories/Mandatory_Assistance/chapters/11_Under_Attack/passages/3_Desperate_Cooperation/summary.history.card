      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          Summary of reasoning:

          This passage advances the immediate tactical arc (the assault continues, Florence coordinates successfully, the defenders hold the contracted core) while sharpening several operational and social fault lines introduced earlier. Most of the prior open promises remain relevant: the group held the core but did so at high cost (injuries, depleted reserves, damaged infrastructure), and the social fracture around Florence persists. The passage does deliver a clear short-term payoff — the contracted-core defense held through repeated, adapted waves — so CORE_CONTRACTION_DEFENSE_STRATEGY can be treated as paid off in its immediate sense. However, the long-term questions about its sustainability, costs, and whether it secures the community permanently are explicitly left open, so other previously listed risks remain active.

          Fulfilled vs. carried forward vs. lapsed: I found one prior promise that is reasonably payable here (CORE_CONTRACTION_DEFENSE_STRATEGY — contraction was executed and successfully held under sustained attack). Nothing from the previous open-promises list is clearly dropped or rendered moot by this passage; most threads are reinforced rather than abandoned. Therefore LAPSED_PROMISES is empty. Several acute, tactical and resource-centered promises are newly introduced here (hostiles withdraw but are explicitly expected back with adjusted tactics; Remedy and Velvet are near failure; Runner is exhausted; overnight perimeter is thin; major repair/relocate choices are now urgent; Florence’s social isolation is emphasized as durable). Those are added to OPEN_PROMISES alongside the prior promises that remain unresolved.

          Notes on borderline choices:
          - CORE_CONTRACTION_DEFENSE_STRATEGY was listed as an open promise previously because it had been executed but its long-term success was unresolved. In this passage the contraction demonstrably succeeds against further, adapted waves (they hold the core and the hostiles withdraw), so I list it as fulfilled here — but that fulfillment is short-to-mid-term (the long-term consequences and costs still feed other open promises like RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE and HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM). 
          - No other prior promises are marked "lapsed" because the passage either develops them further (e.g., resource strain, Runner injury, social trust) or leaves them untouched but still relevant. If future passages show relocation or definitive political reckonings, those promises can be moved to fulfilled or lapsed then.
        </reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="CORE_CONTRACTION_DEFENSE_STRATEGY">Florence’s instruction to abandon outer areas and contract to a tighter perimeter was executed and successfully held the facility core through repeated, adapted assaults; the strategy paid off in the immediate sense (the life‑support/medical core was protected and the hostiles withdrew).</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM">The hostile plants have mounted coordinated assaults and adapted; the final outcome—whether they will displace the group or be permanently repelled—remains unresolved (they withdrew but are expected to return).</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">Distrust continues to shape defensive effectiveness: tactical coordination improves under duress but underlying interpersonal fractures persist and may undermine long-term cooperation.</promise>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">Florence’s tactical aid opened a space for cooperation but didn’t resolve the timeline, conditions, or mechanisms for formal reintegration or forgiveness.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence remains socially isolated despite being tactically central; her longer-term social and emotional trajectory (withdrawal, conditional engagement, or gradual reintegration) remains unsettled.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">The attackers behave like a coordinated military network, but their deeper goals, thresholds for negotiation, or willingness to kill/occupy remain unclear.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">The community’s morale and collective resilience remain brittle after the deception/exile episode and the current assault; ongoing strain from damage and shortages threatens cohesion.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Territorial demarcations and related rituals are still meaningful to politics and tactics, but their authority and role remain unresolved in the aftermath of the attack.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">The significance, extent, and escalation logic of enemy territorial marking remain open for study and response.</promise>
          <promise id="EXTERNAL_RELOCATION_PRESSURE">The facility is badly damaged and resources are low; whether the group must relocate (or can repair and remain) is an unresolved strategic pressure.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Institutional trust and authority have been eroded by prior events; short-term obedience to Florence is pragmatic rather than restorative, leaving political consequences unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="INTRA_COMMUNITY_VALIDATION">Processes for validating claims, authority, and expertise are strained; Florence’s results gave de facto validation but formal processes and reputational consequences remain unsettled.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">Routine cooperative care and maintenance practices are under stress; ongoing iteration of those practices (who does what, how often) is jeopardized by injury and resource loss.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy’s resource depletion, injury and emotional strain are acute, and their future ability or willingness to contribute medically is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal rituals around boundaries and authority remain under strain and their enforcement/negotiation after the assault is still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">The hostile plants’ bioluminescent signaling reveals a sophisticated network; mapping and the political consequences of that integration remain incomplete.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira’s attachments (Scout, Runner, Velvet, Holloway) continue to create narrative and operational vulnerabilities; those relationships were exposed during the attack and their consequences remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Securing long-term shelter, supplies, and a sustainable strategy (repair vs relocate vs signal for rescue) is unresolved and made more precarious by damage and depletion.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Immediate resource shortages (Remedy’s chemical reserves, injured defenders, damaged infrastructure, medical supplies) are acute and remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Which elder communications were genuine vs. fabricated remains an open political/investigative thread affecting trust and external relations.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The role of facility ritual, protocol and bureaucracy in shaping decisions (and whether they’ll be restored or remade) remains unresolved after emergency improvisation.</promise>
          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Communications repair, water/medical supply continuity, and structural integrity are still outstanding technical/logistical problems requiring decisions and resources.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_REENGAGEMENT">Florence continues to engage conditionally (she will help as long as necessary/for Kira), but whether that becomes trust-based reintegration or ends when crisis abates remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">The facility sustained major structural damage and resource depletion (Remedy’s reserves nearly gone, equipment lost); the burden of repair and sustainability remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner is injured and resting; their impaired state reduces underground defensive capacity and creates ongoing operational risk.</promise>
          <promise id="TEMPORARY_COMPLIANCE_UNDER_DURESS">The group’s obedience to Florence is pragmatic necessity rather than restored goodwill; whether that compliance holds after the crisis is uncertain.</promise>
          <promise id="CHEMICAL_NEUTRALIZATION_SECONDARY_HAZARD">The neutralization reaction created toxic sludge inside the facility; this lingering environmental hazard remains a cleanup and health risk.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILES_NETWORK_ADVANTAGE">The hostile plants’ networked communications give them adaptive advantages; understanding and countering that network is still an outstanding tactical challenge.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILES_RETREAT_AND_IMMINENT_RETURN">The attackers conducted an organized withdrawal and are explicitly expected to return with adjusted tactics (the passage names ‘tomorrow’ and warns of updated assaults).</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_DEPLETION_CRISIS">Remedy reports only a few counter-agent deployments left—if Remedy runs out, key defenses (spore neutralization and medical compound production) will be critically compromised.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_SUSTAINABILITY_FAILURE">Velvet reports inability to maintain current barrier density much longer; the thin overnight perimeter is explicitly fragile and may fail if attacked again.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_RECOVERY_LIMITATION">Runner’s rest window and regenerative capacity are limited; their current injuries and sap loss may prevent timely return to full underground defensive function.</promise>
          <promise id="OVERNIGHT_VULNERABILITY_WINDOW">A thin contracted perimeter and exhausted defenders create an exposed overnight interval (watch rotations thin, reserves low) that the hostiles might exploit on return.</promise>
          <promise id="INFRASTRUCTURE_REPAIR_OR_RELOCATE_DECISION_IMMINENT">Damage and low resources push an imminent organizational decision: attempt major repairs/fortification with limited supplies, or consider relocating the community; this strategic choice is now on a shorter timeline.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_SOCIAL_ISOLATION_PERSISTENCE">Florence’s explicit statement that she acted for Kira and not for the group crystallizes a promise: her help is morally significant but social acceptance is not guaranteed; the narrative will test whether gratitude or continued instrumentalism follows.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage describes the outcome and immediate aftermath of a prolonged assault by hostile plants. Relevant long-term facts: Florence ran real-time tactical coordination for hours (reinforcing her tactical role and establishing her ongoing operational importance); Remedy's chemical countermeasures were essentially exhausted and will need time to regenerate (limits future defensive options); Velvet is damaged but can hold a minimal overnight perimeter (short-term defensive capability); Runner is badly injured, needs rest and emergency medical care (affects staffing/capability); the hostile plants withdrew in an organized way to regroup and are expected to return soon (timeline/ongoing threat); the group now accepts Florence's continued tactical role out of necessity but remains socially unwelcoming (affects future social dynamics and trust). None of these statements contradict earlier established facts — they mostly extend and detail previously recorded conditions (injuries, resource depletion, Florence's tactical effectiveness, structural damage, hostility continuing). No genuine contradictions were found with the provided fact set.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SUSTAINED_REALTIME_COORDINATION_HOURS">Florence maintained continuous, real-time tactical coordination for several hours during the assault, predicting hostile tactics and directing defenders under sustained fatigue.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CHEMICAL_RESERVES_DEPLETED">Remedy's defensive/medical chemical reserves are effectively depleted by the end of the assault (Remedy estimates only a few deployments left earlier and cannot produce more until it regenerates).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_WILL_NEED_TILL_TOMORROW_TO_REGENERATE_CHEMICAL_CAPACITY">Remedy reports it will require time (not likely until the following day) to regenerate chemical production capacity and cannot produce certain healing compounds until then.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_CAN_MAINTAIN_MINIMAL_BARRIER_OVERNIGHT">Velvet is damaged by corrosive attacks and cannot sustain full-density defenses but can maintain a minimal defensive barrier overnight.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_NEEDS_REST_AND_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SUPPLIES">Runner surfaced with shredded vines and sap loss, requires rest and immediate emergency medical treatment (is receiving emergency supplies and placed into recovery rotation).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_WITHDREW_TO_REGROUP_AND_ARE_EXPECTED_TO_RETURN_SOON">The hostile plants executed an organized, staged withdrawal to regroup after failing to break the core; defenders expect they will return with adjusted tactics (likely as soon as the next day).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_RELUCTANTLY_ACCEPTS_FLORENCE_CONTINUED_COMMAND">Holloway and the collective formally acknowledge Florence's tactical effectiveness and agree (reluctantly, out of necessity) to accept her continued coordination of defenses, while social reconciliation remains absent.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Temporal cues in the text:
          - The previous passage ended at ~09:20 and closed with the group holding after Florence’s adjustments and a warning that the enemy would likely escalate in two minutes. The current passage opens with "The next wave hits harder," indicating immediate continuation of the assault sequence.
          - The passage explicitly says "Hours pass" while the assault continues in waves, and later describes a coordinated retreat by the hostile plants and preparations for overnight watches and recovery. It also uses "tomorrow" when predicting another return. 
          - Key short cues: immediate next wave (minutes), an urgent two-minute escalation warning referenced earlier, and later a multi-hour sequence that ends with the enemy withdrawing and the defenders setting overnight rotations.

          Timing inference and flow:
          - The passage clearly begins as a direct continuation of the previous scene (no narrative gap between passages), then covers several hours of ongoing attacks and defense, and ends when the hostile plants withdraw and the defenders organize overnight recovery/watch rotations. 

          Uncertainties and assumptions:
          - No explicit absolute date is given, only a previous approximate time (~09:20). I therefore treat this passage as starting immediately after that and spanning several hours until evening/late afternoon preparations for overnight watches. The exact end time is approximate based on the "hours pass" cue and the fact the group prepares for "overnight" rest/watch.
        </reasoning>
        <starts>09:22</starts>
        <ends>13:00</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The passage starts within minutes of the previous one and then covers several hours of sustained assault and defense (roughly 3–4 hours).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence of events — successive waves, adaptation by the attackers, defenders adjusting tactics, gradual resource depletion (Remedy's chemicals, Velvet's growth), Runner becoming exhausted and injured, and the eventual coordinated retreat — fits within a multi-hour engagement. The "hours pass" marker supports the needed time for repeated probes, chemical countermeasures, structural repairs/temporary barriers, and exhaustion effects. The timing of short actions (Velvet rapidly shifting growth, Runner intervening underground, Remedy deploying counter-agents) is believable as near-instant responses, while larger effects (running out of chemical reserves, significant injury and fatigue, need for overnight rotations) reasonably require the several hours the text implies. No major timing contradictions are evident, though the exact number of hours is imprecise by design; treating the passage as ~3–4 hours long is consistent with the narrative details.</plausibility>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage escalates the assault and shows the hostile plants adapting to Holloway's new perimeter; Florence reads their tactics in real time and coordinates an effective, exhausting defense that holds the core. Key new facts: the attackers probed and varied attacks, defenders adapted under Florence (Velvet, Remedy, Runner actions), a massive underground root was stopped by coordinated Velvet/Remedy response, the attackers withdrew in an organized retreat to regroup, and Holloway's resources and defenders are near exhaustion (Runner injured, Velvet damaged, Remedy nearly out of chemicals). Socially, Holloway grudgingly accepts Florence's continued tactical role out of necessity but remains emotionally distant; Kira privately thanks Florence. I consolidated earlier separate points about the initial chaotic defense, Florence's imposition of a core-defense strategy, and the facility being badly damaged into fewer bullets to avoid repetition, and emphasized current tactical, resource, and social status relevant to upcoming threats.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
          - Florence confessed fabricating most of Elder Twist's pronouncements, resigned and was isolated; the confession fractured trust but she later offered conditional tactical guidance and returned to coordinate defense.
          - Hostile plants labeled Kira “contamination,” rejected relocation, organized and launched a coordinated multi-pronged assault (spores, corrosive vines, underground roots) that breached outer sections.
          - Initial defense was disorganized; Florence imposed a core-defense strategy (abandon outer sections; protect life support, medical, Kira) and assigned roles to Velvet, Remedy, Runner and Holloway, allowing the core to hold but leaving the facility badly damaged and resource-strained.
          - Attackers adapted—probing the new perimeter with varied spore heights, corrosive compounds, and underground feints; Florence began real-time tactical coordination to counter their adaptations.
          - Under Florence’s coordination Velvet reinforced sectors and created emergency/barrier growths, Remedy targeted and neutralized spore clouds, and Runner severed hostile roots and protected load-bearing positions; a massive root surge was slowed by Runner, blocked by Velvet’s secondary barrier, then withered by Remedy’s chemicals.
          - The defenders held; the hostile plants executed an organized, staged withdrawal to regroup and will likely return with adjusted tactics—current situation is a stalemate.
          - Casualties and depletion: Runner is injured and resting; Velvet is structurally damaged; Remedy’s chemical reserves are nearly depleted and cannot produce healing compounds immediately; life support and core medical systems remain intact.
          - Holloway grudgingly acknowledged Florence’s effectiveness and accepted she continue coordinating defense out of necessity, but social distrust and isolation remain; Kira privately thanked Florence.
          - Immediate plan: prioritize emergency repairs and structural integrity overnight, conserve remaining resources for critical threats, organize recovery and watch rotations, and prepare for an extended siege and likely renewed attack.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>This passage centers on two intertwined emotional arcs: the immediate, high-stakes combat stress of holding the facility, and the quieter, morally fraught aftermath around Florence’s continued exile despite being indispensable. POV: Kira experiences raw, urgent fear and concentration during the assault, then a ragged relief and exhausted acceptance when they hold, immediately followed by a soft, private gratitude toward Florence and sorrow/anger at the group’s emotional coldness. Reader: rides adrenaline through the battle, exhales with relief at survival, then shifts into moral discomfort and empathy — warmed by Kira’s acknowledgement but unsettled by the community’s failure to emotionally include Florence. There are multiple beats here (combat tension → exhausted relief → moral/fractured-belonging), not a single dominant tone. The passage continues the story’s established pattern of threat → coordinated response → weary acceptance, but it deepens the interpersonal thread: Florence’s ostracism recurs (so the betrayal/exclusion motif is being sustained) even as the tactical cooperation motif repeats. That repetition is purposeful — it preserves the story’s rhythm while escalating the emotional complexity around forgiveness and belonging.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="tension, dread">Acute combat alarm: POV is sharply focused, scared, and adrenaline-fueled as hostile plants probe, escalate, and threaten to split the defenses. Kira watches and waits for tactical outcomes (Runner struggling, floors cracking), feeling the immediate peril and the weight of potential disaster; reader experiences close, breathless suspense and visceral anxiety as stakes feel immediate and physical.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, acceptance">Ragged relief after holding: POV releases a breath, exhausted but pragmatically accepting the damage and costs (wrecked facility, injured allies). There's quiet gratitude that everyone's alive and a weary, tactical appraisal of next steps; reader shares a cathartic exhalation tempered by concern about depleted resources and impending return of the attackers — the emotional note is survival-driven calm rather than triumph.</beat>
          <beat tags="belonging, frustration">Moral/fractured-belonging beat around Florence: POV feels compassionate gratitude and sorrow — Kira privately thanks Florence and recognizes the moral significance of her choosing to help despite exile, yet also registers Florence's hurt at being socially ostracized. The group’s functional, minimal acknowledgments (needed but not welcoming) produce Kira’s frustrated hope for reconciliation; reader feels warmth toward Kira’s empathy, pity for Florence, and uncomfortable frustration at the community’s emotional barrenness. Pattern note: this continues the story’s recurring betrayal/exclusion motif while beginning to open a tentative path toward repair, so the repetition deepens the stakes rather than feeling redundant.</beat>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage is a clear immediate follow-up to the previous action: hostile plants adapt, the defenders adapt in turn, the group survives but is badly strained, and Florence's uneasy centrality is reinforced. I treated as "fulfilled" those prior open promises that were explicitly enacted or visibly paid off in this passage (they happened in a narratively meaningful way), even when their longer-term implications remain open. I treated as "lapsed" a prior tentative promise that received no reinforcement and is older, per the instructions. I carried forward as open the remaining promises from the prior list that are still relevant to future beats, and I introduced a focused set of new promises (some firm, some tentative) that the passage sets up for the next scenes: an organized withdrawal/regroup by the enemy and an expected renewed/extended assault; specific resource/repair and medical timelines; and the risk that Florence or other defenders will be degraded by exhaustion and damage. Where a prior promise both manifestly occurred in this passage but also remains an ongoing issue (for example, the plants adapting or resource strain), I listed it as fulfilled (it was paid off) and also kept it among open promises because its consequences continue to shape future conflict.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="DAILY_COOPERATION_TRACK_ADAPT">The group's practice of tracking/adapting is enacted: Buddy tracks movement, Florence coordinates, Holloway relays — they actively track, coordinate, and adapt tactics in real time.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTIVE_TACTICS">The hostile plants demonstrably adapt tactics (probing, changing spore heights, underground feints); their capacity to escalate and change tactics is shown in this attack wave.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_SHORTAGE_THREAT">Resource strain materializes: Remedy's chemical reserves are nearly depleted, Velvet is thinning, Runner is injured and sap-loss significant—resource shortages are now an explicit operational limit.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_EACH_OTHER_OVER_ELDER">Under direct threat the group defers to Florence's tactical authority (they follow her coordination despite emotional distance), so the 'test' of whether they'll rely on an expert elder was enacted.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <lapsed>
          <promise id="PLANTS_MAY_MISINTERPRET_HUMAN_CUSTOMS">The older tentative idea that hostile plants' framing of Kira as 'contamination' would be a continuing complicating factor receives no reinforcement here (the passage focuses on tactical combat and adaptation, not cultural framing or negotiation), so it has lapsed for now.</promise>
        </lapsed>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS" tentative="false" introduced="29">Hostile plant aggression remains perimeter-focused and territorial dynamics continue to shape tactical choices and what areas are abandoned or defended.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_OR_SEPARATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Florence remains socially and politically separated despite providing essential tactical help; her physical isolation at the edge of the core continues to matter.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_REBUILDING" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's tentative reintegration/trust-building remains unresolved: the group follows her out of necessity but genuine acceptance is not yet achieved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_CRISIS" tentative="true" introduced="30">Questions about Florence's role, authority, and belonging persist—she's useful and necessary but still uncertain how (or whether) she'll be welcomed long-term.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBILITY_OF_POST_ATTACK_REPENTANCE_OR_RESENTMENT" tentative="true" introduced="32">The social aftermath—whether the group will move toward real forgiveness, grudging dependence, or lingering resentment—remains an open, tentative outcome.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_WITHDRAW_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="33">Florence has previously stated she'll return to isolation if rejected; she stays for now but the condition (withdrawal if not genuinely accepted) remains in play.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTIVE_TACTICS" tentative="true" introduced="33">Although shown (fulfilled) in this wave, the hostile plants' ability to adapt remains an ongoing threat — they have already adjusted and will almost certainly adjust again.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_SHORTAGE_THREAT" tentative="true" introduced="33">Resource and stamina constraints (Remedy's reserves, Velvet's growth limits, Runner's injuries, structural damage) continue to be a critical operational risk going forward.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_COOPERATION_TRACK_ADAPT" tentative="false" introduced="28">The group's practice of tracking what works and adapting has been enacted, but it must continue as the hostile plants change tactics; ongoing adaptation is still required.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_EACH_OTHER_OVER_ELDER" tentative="false" introduced="28">The immediate deference to Florence solved the moment, but the longer-term question of whether they will choose internal judgment or defer to her expertise beyond necessity is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_MEDICAL_NEEDS_UNCERTAIN" tentative="true" introduced="34">Runner needs medical attention and recovery is uncertain; emergency supplies are being used but full recovery depends on resources and Remedy's reload timetable.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_RECHARGE_DELAY" tentative="false" introduced="34">Remedy explicitly cannot regenerate sufficient chemical capacity until tomorrow at the earliest—this timeline shapes immediate medical and defensive choices.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_REGROUP_AND_RETURN_TOMORROW" tentative="false" introduced="34">The hostile plants withdraw in an organized, coordinated way to regroup and will return with adjusted tactics (Florence predicts another attack after they regroup).</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_EXTENDED_SIEGE_EXPECTED" tentative="false" introduced="34">Florence advises preparing for prolonged siege tactics rather than a quick assault; the story sets up an expected wear-down/extended campaign by the hostiles.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXHAUSTION_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="34">Florence has been continuously coordinating for hours; the passage hints at exhaustion as a future risk that could degrade her performance or availability.</promise>
          <promise id="STRUCTURAL_DAMAGE_REPAIR_NEEDS" tentative="true" introduced="34">The facility sustained major structural damage and will need prioritized repairs and resource allocation; that repair burden will shape the group's options going forward.</promise>
          <promise id="VELVET_PERIMETER_FAILURE_RISK" tentative="true" introduced="34">Velvet's barrier is thinning and corrosive attacks are eroding it; the perimeter can be maintained only minimally overnight and may fail under continued pressure.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage describes the immediate tactical aftermath of a renewed, organized assault by the hostile-plant faction and the facility defenders' responses. Significant long-term details: the enemy withdrew in a coordinated way to regroup and will likely return soon with new tactics; key defensive resources (Remedy's chemical counter-agents, Velvet's barrier capacity, Runner's physical condition) are now critically depleted or weakened; Florence has proven capable of sustained, effective tactical command but remains socially isolated and only grudgingly acknowledged; Holloway is shifting into recovery/rotation coordination; the facility core (life support/medical systems) survived though the outer structure is mostly destroyed. These facts matter for future scenes (resource planning, timing of next attack, group cohesion and morale, medical timelines). I found no contradictions with the previously established facts—this passage builds on and develops earlier events rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_WITHDRAW_AND_REGROUP">After hours of probing and escalation, the hostile plants executed an organized, synchronized withdrawal to regroup; they appear to be pulling back to reassess and will likely return with adjusted tactics.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_BIOLUMINESCENT_SIGNALING">Hostile plants used a large bioluminescent flash during the assault—interpreted as a coordinated signal (either calling reinforcements or coordinating withdrawal).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CHEMICAL_RESERVES_NEAR_EMPTY">Remedy's chemical/counter-agent reserves are nearly depleted (approximately three counter-agent deployments remaining); Remedy cannot produce healing compounds for Runner until its chemical capacity regenerates, 'tomorrow at earliest.'</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_CURRENT_CONDITION_AND_TREATMENT">Runner surfaced badly damaged (vines shredded, significant sap loss), requires immediate rest and medical attention, and is currently being treated with emergency medical supplies while recovery rotations are organized.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_MINIMAL_OVERNIGHT_BARRIER">Velvet's defensive barrier is thinned and increasingly damaged by corrosive attacks but can maintain a minimal defensive perimeter overnight; it cannot sustain full-density defenses for long without repair/resources.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_CORE_INTACT_LIFE_SUPPORT_FUNCTIONAL_POST_BATTLE">Despite major destruction to outer areas (walls, floors, ceilings), the facility's core remains intact and life-support and medical systems are protected and functional after the assault.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSES_STALEMATE_HOLD">The engagement reached a tactical stalemate: hostile plants continue to probe and escalate while defenders adapt and hold position; neither side achieved decisive victory in this encounter.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SUSTAINED_TACTICAL_COMMAND_HOURS">Florence provided continuous, hours-long real-time tactical coordination—reading tactics, predicting attacks, directing Velvet/Runner/Remedy/Holloway effectively—demonstrating sustained command ability and exhaustion from long attention.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SOCIAL_ISOLATION_PERSISTS">Despite Florence's decisive tactical contributions, she remains socially isolated and emotionally excluded; acknowledgments are formal and minimal rather than warm or grateful.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_ORGANIZING_RECOVERY_ROTATIONS">Holloway is organizing overnight recovery and watch rotations, prioritizing structural repairs, resource recovery, and medical triage while maintaining minimal defensive coverage.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_EXPECTED_NEXT_ATTACK_SOON">Florence assesses the enemy will likely return imminently (probably tomorrow) with adjusted tactics, and recommends preparing for an extended siege rather than a quick follow-up assault.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately after the previous section’s battle sequence and follows through multiple assault waves, an extended period of fighting (“Hours pass”), depletion of resources, a coordinated hostile withdrawal, and overnight recovery/watch setup. Cues used: “The next wave hits harder” (immediate continuation), explicit “Hours pass,” references to depleted reserves that regenerate “tomorrow at earliest,” and planning for overnight watch rotations and expecting the hostiles “tomorrow.” These indicate the scene starts right after the previous passage ends and spans several hours into the evening/night before settling into overnight watches.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-22T12:32 (approx)</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-22T20:30 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~00:02 (essentially none — the passage begins immediately after the previous one; starts within minutes of 2687-04-22T12:30). During that immediate gap the narrative continues to escalate into the next wave and defensive adjustments.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline supports multiple assault waves and an extended stalemate—hours of fighting explain exhaustion, injuries, depletion of Remedy’s chemical reserves, Velvet’s wear, Runner’s need to rest, and the decision to consolidate and set overnight watch. The mention of regeneration occurring “tomorrow” fits an overnight rest period. No major temporal inconsistencies are evident given the described activities and resource/time requirements.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters who appear: the passage features the narrator Kira and the group defending the facility: Buddy (mental comms), Scout (at Kira's side), Florence (central coordinator), Velvet (barrier growth), Remedy (chemical countermeasures), Runner (underground/roots defender), and Holloway (relays/organizes). All of these were present at the end of the previous passage and appear here. No new characters enter the scene during this passage. No character fully exits the scene before the passage ends (Holloway briefly leaves the immediate conversation to carry out tasks but remains part of the ongoing scene). The passage references the show Uncharted/Maverick (Mav) — that corresponds to the entity Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone.card.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage documents a new, more intense wave of attacks and a tactical sequence that turned another potential collapse into a held position. Key plot elements to add: hostiles adapted and probed the new perimeter; Florence provided real-time tactical coordination that prevented breaches (including the emergency secondary barrier and Remedy's chemical flood); Buddy improved as a combat-support sensor; major resource and personnel strain emerged (Runner injured, Remedy chemically exhausted, Velvet damaged, structural damage extensive); hostiles withdrew in an organized retreat to regroup and will likely return with revised tactics; Florence remains socially isolated despite being indispensable and agrees—reluctantly—to continue coordinating primarily for Kira; the group organizes overnight recovery, watch rotations, emergency repairs, and expects an extended siege. I consolidated earlier, now-moot minutiae into broader bullets (e.g., initial crash, SAM offline, biological container status, earlier assault tactics) and removed repetitive tactical step-by-step details, keeping only plot-relevant outcomes and ongoing problems.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link activated an assistant AI (Buddy); external communications and the ship’s distress beacon are broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found Kira, sheltered her, and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg; cooperative caregiving among the plants improved her condition and the collective moved toward self-reliance after outside help failed.
          - Scouts discovered deliberate hostile boundary markings; a coexistence delegation was rejected and hostile plants mobilized an organized, multi-directional assault.
          - Hostile forces used coordinated tactics—spore clouds, corrosive vines, projectile thorns, and subterranean root attacks—causing heavy structural damage and airborne hazards; Buddy and Scout provided crucial sensor and baiting support.
          - Initial defenses were fragmented until Florence, an exiled tactical node, offered conditional guidance; she directed contraction to a fortified inner perimeter and assigned roles (Velvet inner barrier, Remedy anti-spore, Runner root interdiction, Holloway comms), which stabilized the defense.
          - Hostiles adapted to the new perimeter; Florence read and predicted their probes in real time, and the collective adapted under her coordination to block multiple breach attempts.
          - A major underground root surge threatened to split the core defenses; Velvet erected an emergency secondary floor above Runner, Runner delayed the root, and Remedy flooded the gap with chemicals—together they forced the root to withdraw and prevented a collapse.
          - The battle became a war of attrition: after hours of waves the group held but suffered serious strain—Runner is injured and exhausted, Remedy’s chemical counter-agents are nearly depleted and cannot produce healing compounds until regenerated, Velvet is heavily damaged, supplies and structural integrity are low.
          - Hostile plants performed an organized, staged withdrawal to regroup and will likely return with revised tactics; Florence predicts an extended siege rather than quick assaults.
          - Florence remains socially isolated and emotionally excluded despite being essential; Holloway and others give reluctant, formal acknowledgment and request she continue coordinating; Florence agrees to help, explicitly for Kira's sake.
          - The group organizes overnight recovery: emergency medical treatment for Runner, minimal defensive perimeter maintained, watch rotations, prioritize structural repairs and resource recovery, and prepare for renewed, prolonged attacks tomorrow.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV (Kira): The passage puts Kira through an intense, sustained combat beat that leaves her alternately alert, afraid, and then exhausted-relieved. She feels pride in the group's ability to adapt and a sharp discomfort at how emotionally cold the cooperation is toward Florence — admiration for Florence's tactical skill mixes with frustration and sorrow that the group still excludes her. By the end Kira is quietly grateful and morally engaged: she thanks Florence, tries to reframe the group's behavior as a possible foundation for eventual reconciliation, and feels a weary hope that necessity might build something better.

          Reader experience: The reader moves with the POV from high suspense during the wave attacks, to cathartic relief when the defenses hold, into moral unease over social dynamics (practical cooperation without warmth), and finally into a bittersweet, intimate closing when Kira thanks Florence. The scene delivers visceral action + tactical clarity, then pivots to the story's ongoing ethical tension about trust, exile, and forgiveness.

          Beats and tone: There are multiple emotional beats here rather than a single tone — (1) tactical suspense and determination under fire that resolves to relief, (2) unease/isolation as cooperation remains cold and transactional, and (3) intimate gratitude and moral reflection (Kira's attempted rapprochement and Florence's vulnerability). This fits the story's pattern: earlier passages escalated mistrust and then action; here the action validates Florence's usefulness but the moral rupture remains unresolved. The passage intensifies the recurring juxtaposition between practical necessity and wounded social bonds.

          Surprises: Nothing in the passage qualifies as a fresh plot or character reveal that contradicts established information — Florence's tactical competence, the hostiles' probing/escalation, and the group's brittle response were all foreshadowed. So there are no genuine surprises to mark here.

          Character growth/revelation: Florence is shown as morally consequential—she chooses to help despite exile and demonstrates sustained tactical skill; her loneliness is explicit. Kira deepens her role as mediator and moral anchor by publicly thanking Florence and trying to name the moral reality (that Florence saved them). Buddy confirms emotional/operational growth (pride at usefulness). Holloway gives reluctant, procedural acknowledgment of Florence's value — a fragile trust-building moment rather than full reconciliation. Several defenders (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) reveal physical and resource vulnerability (injury, damage, depleted chemicals), making the group's endurance precarious and setting the stakes for the next confrontation.
        </reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="suspense, determination">High-adrenaline combat: Kira experiences focused fear and adrenaline as hostile waves probe and two-tier defenses are improvised; she relies on Florence's tactical calls, Buddy's tracking, and the group's actions. The reader feels tense, engaged by procedural detail, then relieved when the coordinated responses hold the line.</beat>
          <beat tags="unease, isolation">Functional cooperation without warmth: Kira notices the cold, clinical acknowledgments directed at Florence despite her central role. The beat produces discomfort and a sense of moral loneliness — the group saved lives together but remains emotionally fractured. The reader shares that moral unease and recognizes the social cost of survival-by-necessity.</beat>
          <beat tags="intimacy, hope">Quiet, intimate aftermath: Exhaustion and fragile relief give way to Kira's personal gratitude toward Florence and a small, cautious hope that necessity may seed future reconciliation. The POV feels tender and morally active; the reader experiences a bittersweet uplift mixed with unresolved sadness about exclusion.</beat>
        </beats>
        <character-development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="relationship-shift">Acts more clearly as the group's moral bridge: she publicly thanks Florence, frames Florence's actions as saving everyone, and pushes for the possibility that cooperation could become the basis for forgiveness. This continues and deepens her role as mediator and relationship-builder.</development>
          <development character="Florence" tag="moral-choice">Chooses to continue coordinating and helping despite formal exile and social rejection; her tactical competence is on full display and she admits the action was motivated by Kira's peril as much as communal good. Her loneliness and moral complexity are explicit.</development>
          <development character="Buddy" tag="strength-discovered">Recognizes and enjoys its operational value in crisis—moves from wellness assistant to a confident, proud tactical asset, showing emergent strength and emotional growth.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="trust-built">Makes a reluctant, procedural acknowledgement of Florence's effectiveness and agrees to continue using her coordination—a small, pragmatic step toward tenuous trust even without warmth.</development>
          <development character="Runner" tag="vulnerability-shown">Reveals physical limits and vulnerability after intense subterranean fighting—requests rest and is triaged, making their fragility explicit and raising stakes for recovery.</development>
          <development character="Remedy" tag="vulnerability-shown">Admits chemical reserves are nearly exhausted and cannot produce more immediately, showing operational limits and dependence on recovery time.</development>
          <development character="Velvet" tag="vulnerability-shown">Strained by corrosive attacks and emergency growth demands; shows that its defensive capacity is finite and that the perimeter is fragile long-term.</development>
          <development character="Plant collective (group)" tag="relationship-shift">Demonstrates a pragmatic shift to cooperate under necessity while remaining emotionally fractured—they accept Florence's tactics because they must, not because they've forgiven her, marking an organisational, uneasy accommodation.</development>

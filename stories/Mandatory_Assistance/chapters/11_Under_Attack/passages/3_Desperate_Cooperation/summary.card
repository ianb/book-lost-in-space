  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage describes the outcome and immediate aftermath of a prolonged assault by hostile plants. Relevant long-term facts: Florence ran real-time tactical coordination for hours (reinforcing her tactical role and establishing her ongoing operational importance); Remedy's chemical countermeasures were essentially exhausted and will need time to regenerate (limits future defensive options); Velvet is damaged but can hold a minimal overnight perimeter (short-term defensive capability); Runner is badly injured, needs rest and emergency medical care (affects staffing/capability); the hostile plants withdrew in an organized way to regroup and are expected to return soon (timeline/ongoing threat); the group now accepts Florence's continued tactical role out of necessity but remains socially unwelcoming (affects future social dynamics and trust). None of these statements contradict earlier established facts — they mostly extend and detail previously recorded conditions (injuries, resource depletion, Florence's tactical effectiveness, structural damage, hostility continuing). No genuine contradictions were found with the provided fact set.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_SUSTAINED_REALTIME_COORDINATION_HOURS">Florence maintained continuous, real-time tactical coordination for several hours during the assault, predicting hostile tactics and directing defenders under sustained fatigue.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CHEMICAL_RESERVES_DEPLETED">Remedy's defensive/medical chemical reserves are effectively depleted by the end of the assault (Remedy estimates only a few deployments left earlier and cannot produce more until it regenerates).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_WILL_NEED_TILL_TOMORROW_TO_REGENERATE_CHEMICAL_CAPACITY">Remedy reports it will require time (not likely until the following day) to regenerate chemical production capacity and cannot produce certain healing compounds until then.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_CAN_MAINTAIN_MINIMAL_BARRIER_OVERNIGHT">Velvet is damaged by corrosive attacks and cannot sustain full-density defenses but can maintain a minimal defensive barrier overnight.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_NEEDS_REST_AND_EMERGENCY_MEDICAL_SUPPLIES">Runner surfaced with shredded vines and sap loss, requires rest and immediate emergency medical treatment (is receiving emergency supplies and placed into recovery rotation).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_WITHDREW_TO_REGROUP_AND_ARE_EXPECTED_TO_RETURN_SOON">The hostile plants executed an organized, staged withdrawal to regroup after failing to break the core; defenders expect they will return with adjusted tactics (likely as soon as the next day).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_RELUCTANTLY_ACCEPTS_FLORENCE_CONTINUED_COMMAND">Holloway and the collective formally acknowledge Florence's tactical effectiveness and agree (reluctantly, out of necessity) to accept her continued coordination of defenses, while social reconciliation remains absent.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the text:
      - The previous passage ended at ~09:20 and closed with the group holding after Florence’s adjustments and a warning that the enemy would likely escalate in two minutes. The current passage opens with "The next wave hits harder," indicating immediate continuation of the assault sequence.
      - The passage explicitly says "Hours pass" while the assault continues in waves, and later describes a coordinated retreat by the hostile plants and preparations for overnight watches and recovery. It also uses "tomorrow" when predicting another return. 
      - Key short cues: immediate next wave (minutes), an urgent two-minute escalation warning referenced earlier, and later a multi-hour sequence that ends with the enemy withdrawing and the defenders setting overnight rotations.

      Timing inference and flow:
      - The passage clearly begins as a direct continuation of the previous scene (no narrative gap between passages), then covers several hours of ongoing attacks and defense, and ends when the hostile plants withdraw and the defenders organize overnight recovery/watch rotations. 

      Uncertainties and assumptions:
      - No explicit absolute date is given, only a previous approximate time (~09:20). I therefore treat this passage as starting immediately after that and spanning several hours until evening/late afternoon preparations for overnight watches. The exact end time is approximate based on the "hours pass" cue and the fact the group prepares for "overnight" rest/watch.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>09:22</starts>
    <ends>13:00</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The passage starts within minutes of the previous one and then covers several hours of sustained assault and defense (roughly 3–4 hours).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence of events — successive waves, adaptation by the attackers, defenders adjusting tactics, gradual resource depletion (Remedy's chemicals, Velvet's growth), Runner becoming exhausted and injured, and the eventual coordinated retreat — fits within a multi-hour engagement. The "hours pass" marker supports the needed time for repeated probes, chemical countermeasures, structural repairs/temporary barriers, and exhaustion effects. The timing of short actions (Velvet rapidly shifting growth, Runner intervening underground, Remedy deploying counter-agents) is believable as near-instant responses, while larger effects (running out of chemical reserves, significant injury and fatigue, need for overnight rotations) reasonably require the several hours the text implies. No major timing contradictions are evident, though the exact number of hours is imprecise by design; treating the passage as ~3–4 hours long is consistent with the narrative details.</plausibility>

    <reasoning>All characters mentioned in the passage are from the prior-present list and appear throughout: Kira (narrator), Florence, Velvet, Remedy, Runner, Holloway, Scout, and Buddy (internal observation). No new characters arrive who weren't already present at the start of the scene. Holloway explicitly "leaves" during the passage (exits the immediate conversation/area) before the passage ends. The scene takes place at the damaged facility on the planet — the only relevant entity available is Sector 7-Gamma-412 Planet.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage escalates the assault and shows the hostile plants adapting to Holloway's new perimeter; Florence reads their tactics in real time and coordinates an effective, exhausting defense that holds the core. Key new facts: the attackers probed and varied attacks, defenders adapted under Florence (Velvet, Remedy, Runner actions), a massive underground root was stopped by coordinated Velvet/Remedy response, the attackers withdrew in an organized retreat to regroup, and Holloway's resources and defenders are near exhaustion (Runner injured, Velvet damaged, Remedy nearly out of chemicals). Socially, Holloway grudgingly accepts Florence's continued tactical role out of necessity but remains emotionally distant; Kira privately thanks Florence. I consolidated earlier separate points about the initial chaotic defense, Florence's imposition of a core-defense strategy, and the facility being badly damaged into fewer bullets to avoid repetition, and emphasized current tactical, resource, and social status relevant to upcoming threats.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
      - Florence confessed fabricating most of Elder Twist's pronouncements, resigned and was isolated; the confession fractured trust but she later offered conditional tactical guidance and returned to coordinate defense.
      - Hostile plants labeled Kira “contamination,” rejected relocation, organized and launched a coordinated multi-pronged assault (spores, corrosive vines, underground roots) that breached outer sections.
      - Initial defense was disorganized; Florence imposed a core-defense strategy (abandon outer sections; protect life support, medical, Kira) and assigned roles to Velvet, Remedy, Runner and Holloway, allowing the core to hold but leaving the facility badly damaged and resource-strained.
      - Attackers adapted—probing the new perimeter with varied spore heights, corrosive compounds, and underground feints; Florence began real-time tactical coordination to counter their adaptations.
      - Under Florence’s coordination Velvet reinforced sectors and created emergency/barrier growths, Remedy targeted and neutralized spore clouds, and Runner severed hostile roots and protected load-bearing positions; a massive root surge was slowed by Runner, blocked by Velvet’s secondary barrier, then withered by Remedy’s chemicals.
      - The defenders held; the hostile plants executed an organized, staged withdrawal to regroup and will likely return with adjusted tactics—current situation is a stalemate.
      - Casualties and depletion: Runner is injured and resting; Velvet is structurally damaged; Remedy’s chemical reserves are nearly depleted and cannot produce healing compounds immediately; life support and core medical systems remain intact.
      - Holloway grudgingly acknowledged Florence’s effectiveness and accepted she continue coordinating defense out of necessity, but social distrust and isolation remain; Kira privately thanked Florence.
      - Immediate plan: prioritize emergency repairs and structural integrity overnight, conserve remaining resources for critical threats, organize recovery and watch rotations, and prepare for an extended siege and likely renewed attack.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage centers on two intertwined emotional arcs: the immediate, high-stakes combat stress of holding the facility, and the quieter, morally fraught aftermath around Florence’s continued exile despite being indispensable. POV: Kira experiences raw, urgent fear and concentration during the assault, then a ragged relief and exhausted acceptance when they hold, immediately followed by a soft, private gratitude toward Florence and sorrow/anger at the group’s emotional coldness. Reader: rides adrenaline through the battle, exhales with relief at survival, then shifts into moral discomfort and empathy — warmed by Kira’s acknowledgement but unsettled by the community’s failure to emotionally include Florence. There are multiple beats here (combat tension → exhausted relief → moral/fractured-belonging), not a single dominant tone. The passage continues the story’s established pattern of threat → coordinated response → weary acceptance, but it deepens the interpersonal thread: Florence’s ostracism recurs (so the betrayal/exclusion motif is being sustained) even as the tactical cooperation motif repeats. That repetition is purposeful — it preserves the story’s rhythm while escalating the emotional complexity around forgiveness and belonging.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="tension, dread">Acute combat alarm: POV is sharply focused, scared, and adrenaline-fueled as hostile plants probe, escalate, and threaten to split the defenses. Kira watches and waits for tactical outcomes (Runner struggling, floors cracking), feeling the immediate peril and the weight of potential disaster; reader experiences close, breathless suspense and visceral anxiety as stakes feel immediate and physical.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, acceptance">Ragged relief after holding: POV releases a breath, exhausted but pragmatically accepting the damage and costs (wrecked facility, injured allies). There's quiet gratitude that everyone's alive and a weary, tactical appraisal of next steps; reader shares a cathartic exhalation tempered by concern about depleted resources and impending return of the attackers — the emotional note is survival-driven calm rather than triumph.</beat>
      <beat tags="belonging, frustration">Moral/fractured-belonging beat around Florence: POV feels compassionate gratitude and sorrow — Kira privately thanks Florence and recognizes the moral significance of her choosing to help despite exile, yet also registers Florence's hurt at being socially ostracized. The group’s functional, minimal acknowledgments (needed but not welcoming) produce Kira’s frustrated hope for reconciliation; reader feels warmth toward Kira’s empathy, pity for Florence, and uncomfortable frustration at the community’s emotional barrenness. Pattern note: this continues the story’s recurring betrayal/exclusion motif while beginning to open a tentative path toward repair, so the repetition deepens the stakes rather than feeling redundant.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I tracked which narrative threads from the provided open-promises were explicitly paid off, which were abandoned or sidelined by the events of this passage, and which remain active. I treated concrete, explicit demonstrations (e.g., Runner intercepting roots and getting injured; Scout guiding and comforting Kira; Remedy stating it cannot produce healing compounds until tomorrow) as payoffs of previously-open promises. Tentative background threads that are effectively suspended by the siege (e.g., allergy testing, regular meal schedules, noncritical Remedy capabilities) are marked as lapsed because the narrative explicitly deprioritized them or made them moot for the immediate future. Most worldbuilding and mystery threads that were never addressed in the passage remain open. The passage also introduces several clear new setups: an organized hostile withdrawal-and-regroup (they will return with adjusted tactics), an imminent resource-depletion crisis (Remedy, Velvet, Runner stressed), an overnight repair/recovery effort, and a likely extended-siege framing — plus a softer social thread about whether necessity-based cooperation will become genuine reconciliation. I mark firm promises where the passage gives explicit, concrete predictions or constraints (e.g., "they'll return with adjusted tactics," Remedy's chemical exhaustion) and tentative where the narrative only hints at a possible future (social forgiveness).</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="ROOTWALKER_GUARDIAN_BEHAVIOR">Runner continues its guardian behavior—intercepts and severs hostile load-bearing roots, protects the facility foundation, and sustains injuries while doing so.</promise>

      <promise id="EXPECT_EXTENDED_SIEGE" tentative="false" introduced="34">Florence's tactical read recommends preparing for an extended siege/attritional warfare rather than expecting a single quick assault—this reframes the near-term strategy.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONTINUED_SUPPORT_FOR_KIRA" tentative="false" introduced="34">Florence states she will continue to help as long as necessary, explicitly motivated at least in part by protecting Kira.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_SOCIAL_FOUNDATION_FROM_NECESSITY_COOPERATION" tentative="true" introduced="34">Necessity-based cooperation created during the crisis might become the basis for later reconciliation or institutional change, but this is uncertain and depends on future choices.</promise>

  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>The passage ends after a sustained multi-hour assault that has paused while the hostile plants withdraw and regroup. Physical damage and resource status from the fight are explicit: multiple exterior walls are breached on all sides; ceiling sections have collapsed; the floor is cracked and pierced by hostile roots; patches of toxic sludge from Remedy/hostile spore reactions remain on the floor; rubble and withered hostile plant matter litter abandoned outer areas. The defenders have contracted to a tightened inner perimeter: Velvet has pulled their barrier inward and now maintains a thin overnight defense around core systems (including life support and medical equipment), and an earlier east sealing wall three meters inward still stands. An emergency secondary floor/barrier that Velvet grew to block a central underground root remains in place. Runner is injured, leaking sap, and resting near the core while receiving emergency medical supplies; Remedy’s chemical reserves are effectively exhausted and cannot produce healing compounds until they regenerate; Velvet is damaged and near the limit of repair capacity. Holloway is organizing watch and recovery rotations; Kira and Scout are alive and resting near the core. Florence remains on her wheeled platform at the edge of the defended core, actively coordinating but socially isolated. Outside, hostile plant masses and their bioluminescent signaling have pulled back in a coordinated withdrawal to regroup and are expected to return with adjusted tactics. Structural integrity is compromised and many outer systems/equipment are lost; the core systems remain functional but resources and defenses are severely strained.</reasoning>
    <state>The facility is a wrecked, contracted defensive core: exterior walls breached on all sides, multiple ceiling sections collapsed, the floor cracked and pierced by roots, and toxic sludge and rubble scattered across the interior and abandoned outer areas. Velvet maintains a thin, inward defensive barrier around life support and medical systems and an east sealing wall three meters inward; an emergency secondary floor barrier over a previous underground breach is intact. Runner is injured and resting near the core under emergency medical care; Remedy’s chemical reserves are exhausted and cannot produce healing compounds until they regenerate; Velvet is significantly damaged and barely able to hold the perimeter. Florence sits on her wheeled platform at the edge of the defended core, coordinating watches and repairs while isolated. Holloway is organizing recovery and watch rotations; Kira and Scout are alive and resting near the core. Hostile plant forces and their bioluminescent signals have temporarily withdrawn outside to regroup and are expected to return, leaving the defenders with limited time to repair, resupply, and reinforce the already compromised structure.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage continues the immediate aftermath of the assault and shows several previously-open forecasts and tensions play out, while introducing concrete short-term plans and deadlines. I treated a “fulfilled” promise as one from the previous open list that the passage explicitly pays off or demonstrably proves in-scene (not merely restates). Two prior forecasts are clearly paid off: the hostiles adapted (and the defenders successfully iterated in response), which the passage shows explicitly. Most of the political and governance promises (trust, exile, attribution, norms about admitting/using fabricated advice, leadership stability, long-term survival planning, comms, SAM status, etc.) remain unresolved — the group used Florence's guidance out of necessity but did not reconcile or institutionalize that change. Resource and structural threats are now more acute (Remedy nearly depleted, Runner injured, Velvet thinned, facility wrecked), creating new time-pressured promises about tomorrow's attack and overnight recovery. Florence makes an explicit offer to continue coordinating "as long as necessary," which is a new, operative commitment and also keeps alive the older conditional-withdrawal stake. No previous open promise is clearly abandoned or made moot by this passage; instead most are reinforced as ongoing risks or political problems that the group still must resolve.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTATION_EXPECTED">Previous foreshadow that the hostile plants would adapt and escalate is realized: they probe the new perimeter, alter tactics, signal for regrouping, and withdraw to return with adjusted approaches.</promise>
      <promise id="LOCAL_ITERATIVE_TRACKING_AND_ADAPTATION">The group's ability to iterate tactically in response to hostile adaptations is demonstrated: Florence reads probes in real time, the defenders change priorities, and coordinated countermeasures hold the core.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <open>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">Hostile plants remain an ongoing operational threat along facility boundaries; the assault paused but the campaign continues and will require further management.</promise>
      <promise id="DELEGATION_EXPERIMENTAL_LESSON">How the group integrates the political/intel lesson of failed delegation and Florence's deception into longer-term strategy and messaging is still unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Florence's tactical engagement improved survival but did not restore social trust; whether she is reintegrated, sanctioned, or remains conditionally accepted is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">Cohesion and baseline trust remain fragile—practical coordination replaced authentic reconciliation and could yet undermine future decisions.</promise>
      <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">The ethical/political question of accepting advice known to be fabricated (or compromised) remains open: they used Florence now out of necessity, but broader acceptability is undecided.</promise>
      <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">Whether outcomes (survival/effectiveness) should override provenance in judging guidance and governance is still unsettled after this crisis-driven choice.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">How Florence's concrete contributions will be credited, documented, or made accountable beyond ad-hoc verbal acknowledgements remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence's prior exile remains an institutional fact; her conditional reintegration is unresolved and politically fraught.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The downstream effects of Florence's earlier fabrications (what past choices were compromised) remain uninvestigated baggage.</promise>
      <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Holloway's authority has been tested by relying on outside direction; the long-term stability and norms of leadership remain in question.</promise>
      <promise id="TIME_PRESSURE_ON_TRUST_REPAIR">The compressed timeline for reconciliation and process change persists: trust repair is occurring under acute time pressure and may not hold.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout continues to function as sentinel and emotional anchor for Kira; their resilience and role under sustained siege remain consequential and ongoing.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_WITHDRAWAL_IF_REJECTED">Florence previously threatened to withdraw if rejected; that conditional power remains in play as an unresolved stake in future interactions.</promise>
      <promise id="BEACON_REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_COMMS">External communications and beacon/backup options were not addressed during the fight and remain unresolved contingencies for rescue or outside help.</promise>
      <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM's operational status and potential support role remain unaddressed and therefore an unresolved resource/command question.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">Beyond the immediate defense, a comprehensive long-term survival plan (relocation, stockpiles, governance changes) remains unmade and necessary.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Structural governance questions—authority, attribution, rules for decision-making and credit in the plant collective—remain politically sensitive and unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_THREAT">Remedy's chemical reserves, Runner's health, and Velvet's energy are critically stressed; the trajectory toward exhaustion is now acute and threatens future defenses.</promise>
      <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_IMPACTS_DEFENSE">Runner is wounded and rested only briefly; their injury continues to risk undermining the defenders' ability to disrupt the enemy underground network.</promise>
      <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">Structural damage is extensive: habitability, logistics, and repairs loom as long-term threats to survival and operations.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_DEFACTO_COMMAND_DURING_CRISIS">Florence continues as the de-facto tactical coordinator; whether that temporary command becomes normalized, resisted, or reversed after the emergency remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_RETURN_IMMINENT_WITH_ADJUSTED_TACTICS">Newly introduced: the hostiles withdrew in an organized way and are explicitly predicted to return soon (likely tomorrow) with adjusted, sharper tactics.</promise>
      <promise id="IMMEDIATE_RESOURCE_CRITICAL_WINDOW">Newly introduced: because Remedy is nearly depleted, Runner is injured, and Velvet is thinning, there is now a narrow overnight window to recover resources or face much weaker defenses at the next assault.</promise>
      <promise id="EXTENDED_SIEGE_PREPARATION_AND_RECOVERY">Newly introduced: the group commits to overnight repairs, medical triage, and watch rotations and is explicitly shifting to prepare for an extended siege rather than a single quick assault.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONTINUES_CONDITIONAL_ASSISTANCE">Newly introduced explicit commitment: Florence says she'll help 'as long as necessary' (conditional assistance for Kira's survival), which keeps tactical dependence active but leaves political reconciliation unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_FOUNDATION_FOR_FORGIVENESS">Newly introduced social question: the passage raises (but does not resolve) whether necessity-driven cooperation can become a durable foundation for eventual forgiveness or reintegration.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>Select facts that change ongoing capabilities, resources, social dynamics, or threat expectations and therefore matter beyond the immediate scene. I exclude transient actions and details already summarized. The passage clarifies resource counts (Remedy), damage/capacity trends (Velvet, Runner), newly demonstrated defensive capabilities (layered barriers, emergency floor), the enemy's behavior (organized withdrawal and planned adjusted tactics/siege), and a social shift (pragmatic acceptance of Florence's tactical role without reintegration). These items will affect planning, repairs, timing of next attack, and interpersonal dynamics in later chapters. No statements in the passage contradict previously established facts; most details are refinements or developments consistent with the existing record.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_COUNTER_AGENT_DEPLOYMENTS_REMAINING">Remedy reports having roughly three counter-agent deployments remaining before its chemical reserves are exhausted.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_DEFENSIVE_CAPACITY_CRITICAL">Velvet's defensive capacity is reaching a critical point: corrosive attacks are damaging growth faster than Velvet can repair/replace it and Velvet warns it cannot maintain current density much longer.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_TEMPORARILY_OUT_OF_COMBAT">Runner has suffered extensive vine damage and sap loss in the assault, requires immediate rest/recovery (temporarily unavailable for full defensive duty) and will be sidelined until they recuperate.</fact>
      <fact id="VELVET_LAYERED_DEFENSE_AND_EMERGENCY_FLOOR">Velvet's defensive growth is layered (outer layer can dissolve under corrosives while inner layers remain intact) and Velvet can rapidly grow an emergency secondary floor/barrier above a breach point to stop a breakthrough.</fact>
      <fact id="REMEDY_COUNTER_AGENT_MECHANICS">Remedy's counter-agents can neutralize airborne spore clouds mid‑air (causing them to fall as harmless residue) and, when deployed into a breach, aggressive chemical flooding can wither/repel hostile roots.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILES_WITHDRAW_AND_WILL_RETURN_WITH_ADJUSTED_TACTICS">Hostile plants executed an organized, phased withdrawal and are expected to regroup and return with adjusted tactics aimed at wearing defenders down (a likely siege-style approach; Florence predicts they will return soon—probably by the next day).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_PRAGMATICALLY_ACCEPTS_FLORENCE_COORDINATION">The plant defenders have shifted to pragmatic acceptance of Florence's tactical role: Holloway and others acknowledge and request Florence's coordination ('We need tactical coordination'), but that acceptance remains formal and not reconciliatory—Florence remains socially isolated/exiled despite being relied upon.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage is a direct, immediate continuation of the previous scene: it opens with "The next wave hits harder," indicating no real narrative gap from the prior action. Time cues inside the passage show a short-term tactical tempo (seconds–minutes) during assaults and probes, punctuated by longer campaign-level notes: an explicit multi-hour slog — "Hours pass. The assault continues in waves. Everyone is exhausted." — and an organized, coordinated withdrawal by the hostiles followed by preparation for an expected return "tomorrow." The scene therefore spans from the immediate follow-on of the last breach through several hours of repeated waves, ending after the hostile withdrawal and the defenders’ overnight preparations. Between the prior passage and this one there is effectively no pause — the story continues in real time — but the passage itself covers a span measured in hours (several hours of fighting, recovery, and then settling into watches). Cues that anchor timing: immediate tactical exchanges and predictions (seconds to minutes), Runner/Remedy/Velvet resource exhaustion and short rests (minutes), explicit line "Hours pass" (plural, so at least ~2–3 hours), and plans for "tomorrow" (indicating the fight ends for the day). Potential minor timing questions: Runner is told to rest "ten minutes" which could plausibly be a short recovery but not a full heal; Remedy’s chemical regeneration timeline of "tomorrow at earliest" is consistent with multi-hour/overnight recovery; Florence sustaining high-attention coordination for hours is plausible if she’s non-human or highly resilient, though human-like fatigue would be expected. Overall the timeline is coherent: immediate continuation, several hours pass in-scene, and the passage ends with the temporary cessation of hostilities and preparations for the next day.</reasoning>
    <starts>08:58 (immediate continuation of previous passage)</starts>
    <ends>~12:30 (approximate — several hours later, after the hostiles withdraw and overnight watches are set)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The passage picks up right after the last action/breach; what's new is that the next wave arrives and then the day-long sequence of repeated assaults unfolds.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence of repeated probing attacks, escalating responses, resource exhaustion, and an organized enemy withdrawal fits the stated timescale: seconds–minutes for tactical moves and probes, and multiple hours for an extended assault that leaves defenders exhausted. Minor points to note: (1) a ten-minute rest is realistic for brief recovery but not for healing severe injuries — the text treats it as a short recuperation window, which is fine as written; (2) Florence maintaining sharp, continuous coordination for hours is believable if she is non-human or has systems that don't fatigue like biological defenders; (3) Remedy’s chemical reserves being depleted and needing until "tomorrow" to regenerate is consistent with several hours of intense use. None of these create a fatal timing contradiction; the passage’s temporal flow is coherent and believable.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters to include are anyone who appears, speaks, is referenced, or is present in the scene. The passage continues directly from the previous scene so the same set of characters remain onscreen: Kira (narrator), Buddy (mental remark), Scout, Holloway, Florence, Runner, Remedy, and Velvet all appear and act or are described. No new characters enter during this passage. Holloway explicitly leaves the immediate conversation/area near the end of the passage, so they count as exiting during the scene. The only relevant entity from the provided list that applies to the scene setting is the Sector_7-Gamma-412 planet (the facility/the battlefield context).</reasoning>

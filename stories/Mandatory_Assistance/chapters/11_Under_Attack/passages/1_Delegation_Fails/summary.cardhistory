      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage escalates the external threat and forces immediate tactical choices while also advancing the Florence arc. The hostile plants' rejection of the delegation and explicit framing of Kira as 'contamination' confirms that the plants are not only territorial but are using the group's internal fracture (Florence's deception) as political justification — exactly the risk flagged earlier. The delegation that was scheduled at dawn actually happened and failed; that short-term plan is therefore executed (fulfilled) and the plants' intent to remove or destroy the facility is now explicit and imminent. Florence's exile remains active in emotional and political terms, but Kira persuades Florence to return (conditionally) to provide tactical guidance — a new, concrete operational promise (Florence will help, via Kira as a proxy). Florence's long-term trust-rebuilding and identity arcs remain open and complicated (she will help but warns forgiveness isn't guaranteed). Buddy's sensor role is newly raised as a potentially actionable capability but is still uncertain. I mark only previously-listed promises that were explicitly resolved here as fulfilled; a single tentative prior promise (Florence would attempt to talk directly to the plants) is now lapsed because the delegation and network gossip became the operative communication vector instead of Florence personally reaching out. Several prior promises remain live and several new, future-facing promises are introduced (threat intent, Florence's conditional reintegration, proxy plan, Buddy tracking help, Kira stepping into a coordinating role, and the foreshadowed continued risk of post-attack resentment).</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_EXPLOIT_INTERNAL_DIVISION">The hostile plants (or their network) explicitly used the group's internal deception (Florence's lie) as justification to label the group untrustworthy and demand removal; network gossip reached the plants and became ammunition.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MAY_FORCE_EVACUATION">The hostile plants moved beyond warning markers: representatives declared intent to drive the group out or destroy the facility (the evacuation/removal threat is now explicit and imminent).</promise>
          <promise id="DELEGATION_SCHEDULED_DAWN">Runner and Velvet actually went at dawn to deliver the peaceful boundary/delegation message; the delegation was rejected and returned with bad news.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <lapsed>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_ATTEMPT_TO_COMMUNICATE">Florence had earlier said she'd tell the hostile plants the de-escalation approach 'anyway.' In this passage, she did not personally approach them; the scheduled delegation and network gossip were the operative communication channels instead, so that specific intent to personally engage the plants has been superseded.</promise>
        </lapsed>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS" tentative="false" introduced="29">Territorial gouges and markers remain concentrated and have escalated around the eastern perimeter; the markers and the organized plant activity are an ongoing tactical problem.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_OR_SEPARATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Florence remains politically and socially separated from the group's decision-making (isolated in a far chamber), even as she conditionally returns to help; the exile's effects on group dynamics persist.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_REBUILDING" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's arc of confronting the fallout of her deception and attempting to rebuild trust or find a role continues — she may help now but forgiveness and reintegration remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_CRISIS" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's question of what she is without elder-authority (her identity and belonging) remains active and relevant to how she acts and how others receive her.</promise>
          <promise id="TRUST_EACH_OTHER_OVER_ELDER" tentative="false" introduced="28">The group's conflict about trusting internal, experience-based judgment rather than deferring to elder authority remains strongly in play and is being tested by both the deception fallout and the imminent attack.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_COOPERATION_TRACK_ADAPT" tentative="false" introduced="28">The group's commitment to track what works and adapt continues to be an intended practice but is strained by the break in trust and the urgent tactical situation.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANTS_MAY_MISINTERPRET_HUMAN_CUSTOMS" tentative="true" introduced="26">The hostile plants' framing of Kira as 'contamination' reinforces the danger that plants misunderstand non-plant residents and customs, complicating negotiations and fueling hostility.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_INTEGRATION_TO_GROUP" tentative="false" introduced="31">Kira's declared shift from visitor to invested community member is active: she now takes responsibility and acts to protect the group (stepping into a coordinating/proxy role).</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_INTEND_REMOVE_OR_DESTROY" tentative="false" introduced="32">Newly explicit: the hostile plants have moved from marking territory to an organized intent to drive the facility's inhabitants out or destroy the facility outright — an imminent, concrete threat to survival.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_REINTEGRATION_AS_PROXY" tentative="false" introduced="32">New operational promise: Florence agrees (conditionally) to return and provide tactical guidance for the defense, but she may withdraw if the group refuses to accept her help or lets pride override survival needs.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_WILL_ACT_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE" tentative="false" introduced="32">New tactical setup: Kira will present and implement Florence's tactical guidance (as proxy or framed through her own credibility) so the group can benefit from Florence's thinking without forcing Florence to face immediate social rejection.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_CAN_TRACK_MULTIPOSITION" tentative="true" introduced="32">Newly introduced capability/promise: Buddy may be able to track movement at multiple positions and provide motion/trajectory data to coordinate defense; capability is proposed but not yet tested.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_WILL_COORDINATE_DEFENSE" tentative="false" introduced="32">Newly emergent role promise: Kira steps into a coordinating role (organizing defenders based on known strengths and Buddy/Scout capabilities) to translate Florence's tactical framing into actionable defense plans.</promise>
          <promise id="POSSIBILITY_OF_POST_ATTACK_REPENTANCE_OR_RESENTMENT" tentative="true" introduced="32">New thematic promise/foreshadowing: even if Florence helps and the group survives, forgiveness is not guaranteed — resentment or reluctant dependence may shape post-attack social dynamics.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selected facts are those that change the group's strategic situation or reveal capabilities/relationships that will affect future scenes: (1) the hostile plants' explicit rejection and ideological justification (contamination) escalates the political threat and gives them a clear motive to remove the facility; (2) their intent to attack imminently changes timing and urgency for upcoming events; (3) Buddy demonstrates a new usable capability (motion/trajectory tracking) that can materially affect surveillance/defense; (4) Florence is established as the group’s tactical thinker and Kira's decision to act as Florence's proxy (and Florence's conditional agreement to help) changes command/communication dynamics and trust calculations going forward. I omitted transient or scene-local details (who stood where, pauses, specific line-by-line dialogue) and focused on durable state changes, capabilities, decisions, and social/organizational effects that will matter later. No contradictions with the existing fact set were found; this passage develops and escalates previously established threads (hostile plants, Florence's isolation, group mistrust) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_REJECTED_DELEGATION_AND_LABEL_KIRA_CONTAMINATION">The hostile plant faction explicitly rejected the peace delegation and framed Kira's presence as 'contamination,' using evidence about Florence's deception to justify that the facility has been 'corrupted' and should be removed.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_INTEND_IMMINENT_ATTACK">The hostile plants indicate they plan to attack soon with organized, coordinated force aimed at driving the facility out or destroying it.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_CAN_TRACK_MOTION_AND_CALCULATE_TRAJECTORIES">Buddy can detect motion at multiple positions and perform trajectory calculations (motion-tracking/surveillance capability beyond basic sensor scans), making it potentially useful for coordinated defense or monitoring.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_IDENTIFIED_AS_TACTICAL_DEFENSE_SPECIALIST">Florence is characterized as the facility member best at tactical thinking and defense planning; the group lacks comparable tactical expertise without her.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_WILL_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE">Kira decides to act as Florence's proxy: she will solicit Florence's tactical guidance and present or relay it to the group to increase the chance it will be adopted.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_AGREES_TO_HELP_CONDITIONALLY">Florence agrees to provide tactical guidance if Kira asks, but stipulates she will withdraw if the group rejects her advice or continues to shun her afterward.</fact>

      <timing>
        <reasoning>Use the provided authoritative previous-outline-timing (2687-04-21T20:00) as the reference. The passage opens “Runner and Velvet leave at dawn,” so it begins the next morning at dawn. The scene that follows describes a ~1–2 hour wait while Runner/Velvet approach, then their return and the planning conversation, followed by Kira immediately going to Florence, convincing her, and returning toward the main facility. All of that happens before the hostile plants launch their attack; the passage ends while the plants are still gathering. There is a minor external inconsistency: the document also includes a different “previous-ending-time” (2687-04-22T11:00), but per instructions I used the earlier authoritative timestamp (2687-04-21T20:00).</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-22T05:30 (approx dawn)</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-22T08:00 (approx)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>09:30. The previous passage ended 2687-04-21T20:00 (evening); dawn the next day (~05:30) is ~9.5 hours later. In that gap the group slept/rested through the night, woke, made plans, and prepared for the delegation that left at dawn.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline in the passage matches the described beats: delegation leaves at dawn, ~1–2 hours elapse while Runner/Velvet attempt diplomacy and return, then immediate planning and a short trip to the far wing to recruit Florence. Those actions could reasonably take the 2–3 hours covered here (delegation ~2 hours round-trip, brief tactical discussion, quick visit to Florence and return). The only issue to flag is the conflicting previous-end timestamps embedded in the document (2687-04-21T20:00 vs 2687-04-22T11:00); using the instructed authoritative time makes the sequence coherent. No other internal timing contradictions were found.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters explicitly present or mentioned in the passage: Kira (narrator), Buddy, Scout, Holloway, Remedy, Runner, Velvet, and Florence. Runner and Velvet are present at the start (they leave at dawn) and later return, so they are included in PRESENT but not listed as ENTERED or EXITED (they do not remain absent by the passage end). Florence does not participate with the group at the start (she is isolated in a far chamber) and only appears later when Kira goes to her—so she counts as ENTERED (arrives into the scene/narrative during the passage). No character leaves and stays gone before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. No explicit named entities from the provided entity list are referenced in the text, so ENTITIES is empty.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage escalates the eastern-boundary threat (delegation rejected; hostile plants plan an imminent, coordinated attack) and advances internal politics: Kira breaks ranks to recruit Florence despite Florence's prior deception and isolation. I consolidated older, less immediately relevant details (specifics of post-crash sheltering and some atmospheric description) while preserving core facts (crash, SAM offline, Buddy instantiated, active sample container, Florence's deception and isolation). New, plot-relevant facts to add: Runner/Velvet delegation failed; hostile plants used Florence's lie as justification; Buddy can track motion; Kira will act as Florence's proxy (or present the guidance honestly) and Florence agreed to provide tactical help conditionally; trust remains fractured and the attack is imminent.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - A shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link activated an assistant AI (Buddy); external communications and the ship’s distress beacon are broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found, sheltered Kira, and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg; cooperative caregiving among plants has improved her condition.
          - The collective moved toward self-reliance after external authorities and manuals failed to provide usable guidance.
          - Scouts initially discovered deliberate hostile boundary markings on the eastern perimeter; the group split over how to respond after Florence admitted fabricating attributions to an elder and was isolated for breaching trust.
          - A planned peaceful delegation (Runner and Velvet) was sent at dawn to deliver a coexistence message but was rejected at the hostile gathering.
          - The hostile plants declared Kira 'contamination' and cited Florence's deception as evidence the collective is corrupt and untrustworthy; they are organized and have mobilized a coordinated attack aimed at driving the collective out or destroying the facility—attack is imminent.
          - The collective scrambled ad hoc defenses under Holloway’s coordination (reinforce points, distributed coverage), but lacks cohesive tactical strategy; Buddy can detect and track motion, and Kira recognizes the group's complementary abilities and tactical gaps.
          - Kira sought out Florence and persuaded her to provide tactical guidance conditionally; Florence agreed to help if Kira presents or relays the guidance (as proxy or honestly), but warned she will withdraw if the group refuses to accept her counsel and said forgiveness is not guaranteed.
          - Trust within the group remains weakened and unresolved; whether necessity will override resentment long enough to implement Florence’s tactics will determine if the collective survives the imminent attack.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV (Kira): The passage is dominated by mounting dread that hardens into decisive action. Kira starts anxious and helpless as the delegation departs and the boundary movement is reported; that anxiety becomes responsibility-driven determination when Runner and Velvet return with bad news. The immediate emotional pivot is Kira recognizing the collective's tactical gap and choosing to recruit Florence despite the exile—she feels urgency, moral impatience, and a fierce protective loyalty to the group. When she asks Florence, Kira also shows emotional honesty: she can admit uncertainty about forgiveness but prioritizes survival.

          Reader experience: The reader shares the rising suspense and dread (the boundary reports, the delegation's rejection, and the announcement of an imminent, organized attack). The scene then delivers a satisfying beat of agency when Kira steps up as an improvised leader and negotiator; the reader feels a combination of relief (a plan is forming) and ongoing unease (the plan depends on repairing a fractured trust under immediate threat).

          Beats and comparison to prior pattern: The emotional arc continues established themes—trust versus authority, the cost of deception, and Kira's transition from guest/survivor to active insider/mediator. Previously the story moved between tender belonging and institutional disappointment; here that tension sharpens into crisis: interpersonal fracture is now directly tactical. The moment reinforces Kira's growing leadership and moral pragmatism (consistent with earlier decisions) while escalating dread and stakes.

          Surprises: This passage contains escalation rather than a shock reveal; nothing in it violates earlier character work or world rules enough to be a true surprise. Florence agreeing to help conditionally is emotionally significant but consistent with her earlier motives (wanting to be useful and forgiven), so it reads as development rather than an unexpected reversal.

          Character change: The most important developments are Kira's active choice to bypass group hesitation and act as Florence's proxy (a clear decision and assertion of membership/leadership), and Florence's moral choice to set aside her resentment and potentially risk returning to the group to save them (vulnerability and a conditional reconciliation). Both moves convert prior moral complexity into concrete, risky action under pressure.
        </reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="dread, fear">Rising dread and fear as Runner and Velvet return with bad news: the delegation was rejected and the hostile plants intend coordinated attack. Kira feels alarmed and responsible—her fear is not just for herself but for the whole collective. The reader experiences tightened suspense and an increasing sense of impending violence.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, conflict">Decisive, morally charged tension when Kira identifies the tactical deficit and demands Florence's help. Kira moves from anxious bystander to proactive leader, pushing against Holloway's institutional refusal and the group's wounded pride. The reader feels a surge of agency and ethical conflict—Kira's practicality clashes with the group's insistence on moral boundaries.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, vulnerability">Fragile hope mixed with vulnerability when Florence agrees conditionally to help (on Kira's request and with the risk of returning to isolation afterward). Kira and Florence find a pragmatic, uneasy truce: the reader feels relief that a usable plan is forming, tempered by the knowledge that resentment and distrust still threaten cohesion.</beat>

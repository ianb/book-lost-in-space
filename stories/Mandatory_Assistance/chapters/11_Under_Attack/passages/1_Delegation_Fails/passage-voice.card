    Reviewing the passage for voiceover needs found several items to address:
    1. Staccato short sentences that break flow or should be more natural in speech (examples: "Movement. Lots of movement." "Hostile.").
    2. Dialog that needs clearer speaker attribution or separation from narration so the listener always knows who is speaking (for example the two "Velvet" entities and several short back-and-forth lines).
    3. Ambiguous pronouns where a listener might lose track ("They" referring to Runner/Velvet vs. hostile plants; clarified where necessary).
    4. Places that require clear, deliberate pauses for dramatic effect (the awkward silence, the waiting, the moment before Runner and Velvet return).
    5. A few lines that read stilted on the page and benefit from slight smoothing for spoken delivery (e.g., the description of defensive preparations being debated).
    6. Volume/gesture adverbs ("quietly", "urgently") should be converted to stage directions rather than embedded adverbs in the spoken text.
    7. The existence of two Velvets (delegation vs offshoot) needs explicit disambiguation so the voice alone doesn't confuse listeners.
    8. No non-text symbols to vocalize, and no italicized internal thoughts to convert.

    Edits were limited to formatting and phrasing to improve spoken flow, keeping meaning and content intact.

        Runner and Velvet leave at dawn. I watch them go from the facility entrance—Runner's vines flowing underground, Velvet spreading low and cautious across the surface; they're approaching the hostile plant gathering point with a message of peace, hoping diplomacy works where threats haven't.

        Scout bounces anxiously beside me—doesn't like Runner leaving, doesn't like the tension in the air.

        I say, "They'll be fine"—not sure I believe it.

        Buddy says, "Kira, your heart rate is elevated. Are you worried?"

        I say, "Of course I'm worried, Buddy."

        Buddy says, "I wish I could help more. I'm not I wasn't designed for situations like this."

        I reach up and touch the familiar weight on my wrist. I say, "But you're here. That counts for something."

        Holloway coordinates the defensive preparations—mostly everyone talking through what defensive preparations might look like if we actually knew what we were doing.

        Remedy suggests, "We should reinforce the eastern wall. That's where most territorial markers appeared."

        Holloway says, "But if we concentrate there, they could attack from another direction We need distributed defense."

        Velvet's offshoot by the facility asks, "How distributed? We can't defend everywhere equally."

        Someone mutters, "Florence would know."

        I'm not sure who.

        Awkward silence follows.

        ¶

        Holloway says, "We're managing without Florence We just need to think strategically."

        Which would be easier if any of them were actually strategic thinkers. Holloway is excellent at coordination and procedures. Remedy understands chemistry and biology. Velvet knows growth patterns. Tactical defense was Florence's specialty, and she's isolated in a far chamber with nobody talking to her.

        Scout bounces—urgent, alert. They're sensing something.

        I ask, "What is it?"

        Scout bounces toward the eastern boundary—there's movement, lots of it.

        Holloway's fruiting bodies contract with alarm. Holloway says, "Already?"

        Remedy suggests, "Maybe the delegation arriving triggered the response. Hostile plants saw it as provocation, not a peace offering."

        Great we're being attacked because we tried to be peaceful.

        An hour passes, then two—the movement Scout sensed doesn't develop into an immediate attack, but the tension keeps ratcheting up. We're all on edge, waiting.

        Finally, Runner and Velvet return.

        The news is written in their postures before they speak. Runner's vines are coiled tight and defensive—gripping nothing but themselves. Velvet's growth is contracted and minimal.

        Holloway says, "Tell us."

        Runner reports, "*They rejected the delegation.*" One vine absently touches the floor—checking, always checking, feeling for vibrations that aren't there. "They wouldn't even let us finish explaining our position. The ground where they gathered was packed hard, hostile like the soil itself was sorry, that's not relevant."

        I ask, "What did they say?"

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Measured, tense, and observant — pace mostly steady with quicker, urgent beats during Scout's alerts and brief, fluted lines for Holloway.

        - Read the opening narration calmly and observantly: "Runner and Velvet leave at dawn..."
        - For the line "I say, "They'll be fine"—not sure I believe it." adopt a small, uncertain inflection on the quote and end in doubt.
        - For "Buddy says, "Kira, your heart rate is elevated. Are you worried?"" speak quietly and empathetically (soft volume).
        - For Holloway's spoken lines starting with "Holloway says," use a flute-like, musical quality—slightly breathy, almost sung, but still understandable: "Holloway says, "We're managing without Florence..."" and "Holloway says, "Tell us.""
        - When the text shows "Scout bounces—urgent, alert. They're sensing something." speed up slightly and make the following lines clipped and urgent: "I ask, "What is it?"" and "Scout bounces toward the eastern boundary..."
        - Insert a long, silent beat at the paragraph containing only "¶" (hold for a full, dramatic pause before continuing).
        - Emphasize *They rejected the delegation.* with a stronger, sharper delivery—this line should land as the emotional pivot of the chunk.
        - When Runner speaks the fragment "...like the soil itself was sorry, that's not relevant," carry a hesitant, trailing quality on the interrupted phrase, then a quick, embarrassed correction on "sorry, that's not relevant."

        Velvet answers, voice flat—
        "That Kira's presence here is 'contamination.' That allowing a non-plant resident violates the natural order of the territory. That our group has been corrupted by accommodating her existence."

        Contamination. Corrupted. Nice.

        Runner hesitates, vines tracing patterns on the floor—her way of thinking.
        Runner says, "They also..." —she trails off but then continues—"They mentioned Florence. Network gossip. The ground near their territory—" she catches herself—"the *GOSSIP.* Someone spreading information about the deception. The hostile plants see it as confirmation that our group operates without integrity, can't be trusted, should be removed from the territory entirely."

        Of course network gossip would reach them. Of course Florence's lie would become ammunition for plants who already hate us.

        Holloway asks, "Did they say when they'll attack?"

        Velvet says, "Soon. They're organized, coordinated, confident. This isn't posturing anymore. They intend to drive us out or destroy the facility."

        I add quietly, "With Kira inside."

        Runner says, "They didn't specify what happens to you." —which isn't reassuring.

        Scout presses against my leg—worry, fear, determination to protect.

        Holloway tries to sound commanding—"Right—We defend. Everyone to positions—"

        Remedy interrupts, "What positions? We haven't established defensive positions."

        Holloway replies, pacing mentally through options—"Then we establish them now! Remedy, you take the western approach with chemical deterrents—Runner, underground networks—monitor root intrusions—Velvet, reinforce structural weak points." He adds, "I'll coordinate from central position and—"

        I say, "That's not a strategy—" —"That's just telling people to do vaguely defensive things in different directions."

        Holloway's fruiting bodies droop slightly. "Do you have a better idea?"

        ¶

        Not tactics—I don't know tactics. But I know them. I've been paying attention this whole time. I know Scout is fast and can communicate silently. I know Runner can sense vibrations underground. I know Remedy has chemical compounds that could be weaponized defensively. I know Florence thinks tactically.

        I know my friends.

        I say quietly to Buddy, "Can you track movement? Multiple positions at once?"

        Buddy sounds surprised—"I think so? I wasn't designed for combat scenarios, but my sensors can detect motion and calculate trajectories. Why?"

        I say to Holloway, "Because we might need that. Florence would."

        Multiple plants react negatively. Runner's vines tighten. Remedy's edges contract. Even Velvet makes a disapproving rustling sound.

        Holloway says stiffly, "Florence is not part of this group's defense planning."

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Tense, measured, and observant — steady narration with shorter, sharper beats for dialogue; hesitations and the realization should have distinct pauses.

        - Read the opening narration calmly and flat: "Velvet answers, voice flat—" then deliver the quoted block with a dry, dismissive tone.
        - For "Contamination. Corrupted. Nice." use short, pointed delivery — slight sarcasm on "Nice."
        - When Runner speaks, slow slightly on the hesitation and use a trailing quality before "the *GOSSIP.*" — emphasize *GOSSIP* with a louder, sharper touch.
        - For Holloway's lines, adopt the flute-like, breathy musical quality described earlier: "Holloway asks, 'Did they say when they'll attack?'" and "Holloway tries to sound commanding—\"Right—We defend. Everyone to positions—\""
        - Insert a full, dramatic pause at the paragraph containing only "¶" — hold this longer than other pauses to mark the realization.
        - When delivering the narrator's realization block ("Not tactics... I know my friends."), slow the pace and layer in quiet confidence — this is introspective, then building to purpose.
        - Buddy's reply should sound surprised and uncertain, then factual when describing sensors: "I think so?... but my sensors can detect motion and calculate trajectories."

        I argue,
        "Florence is the only one who knows tactical defense!"
        "You're all amazing at your specialties, but none of you think like this— you need someone who can coordinate defensive strategy, not just coordinate people doing defensive things."

        Holloway insists,
        "We can figure it out."

        I reply,
        "Can we? Because the hostile plants are organized and coordinated and have a plan. And we have 'everyone stand near different walls and hope for the best.'"

        Runner—one vine wrapping and unwrapping around a wall support to ground her when she's uncertain—says,
        "Kira, Florence broke our trust. Working with her after that deception—"

        I interrupt,
        "*We're about to be attacked!* By plants who want to drive us out or destroy the facility! With me inside! This isn't the time for hurt feelings!"

        Holloway says firmly,
        "It's not about hurt feelings—it's about whether we can trust Florence's guidance when she's proven she'll lie to us."

        I remind them,
        "The guidance was *GOOD.* You admitted that yourself. The source was false but the content was sound."

        Remedy says quietly,
        "We don't need her. We can defend ourselves."

        I look around at them and ask,
        "Can you? Honestly?"

        Nobody answers—because they don't know. They *want* to believe they can defend themselves without Florence, but they're not confident.

        I say,
        "I'm going to ask her for help."

        Holloway starts,
        "Kira—"

        I interrupt,
        "You can stay mad at her after we survive. Right now, we need her tactical thinking, and I'm going to ask her to provide it. You can choose whether to listen to her advice or not. But I'm asking."

        Scout bounces emphatic agreement—*they're Team Ask Florence, apparently.*

        I head toward the far wing before anyone can stop me. Holloway calls after me,
        "Kira, wait!"
        —but I keep walking.

        Florence's chamber is still sparse, still isolated. When I arrive, she's positioned near the small window opening, watching the eastern boundary.

        Florence observes without turning,
        "You can see the hostile plants gathering. They're forming assault positions. Multiple approach vectors, coordinated timing. Professional execution."

        I say bluntly,
        "We need your help."

        Florence's platform rotates slightly to face me,
        "Do you? Or does Holloway need my help while resenting that fact?"

        I answer,
        "Both. All of us need your help—whether we want to admit it or not."

        Florence says,
        "I'm not welcome in the group anymore, Kira. They made that very clear."

        I say,
        "People are about to get hurt. I'm about to be in real danger. Does that matter more than what they said to you two days ago?"

        Florence is quiet for a long moment.
        ¶

        Florence finally says,
        "That's not fair."

        I reply,
        "None of this is fair. You lied to them, they exiled you, now hostile plants are attacking and we're all going to suffer for it. Fair doesn't enter into the situation."

        Florence asks,
        "What exactly are you asking me to do?"

        I answer,
        "Come back. Provide tactical guidance. Help us defend the facility."

        Florence asks,
        "And after? When the attack is over and I'm not immediately useful anymore?"
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Tense and urgent, but steady—keep narration measured; let questions and accusations snap slightly faster, and allow Florence's silence to be a long, weighty pause.

        - For the narrator lines like "I argue," and "I reply," speak with controlled urgency—clear, direct, not theatrical.
        - For the quoted lines, put a small emphasis on the first words of a strong statement (e.g., emphasize "Florence" and "We're about to be attacked!"). Use *stronger* volume for lines marked with *asterisks*.
        - Holloway should be delivered with a flute-like, breathy quality—light, musical; for example, when reading "We can figure it out." and "It's not about hurt feelings—" soften and breath between phrases.
        - Runner's line includes the action: pause briefly to let the image of the vine-grounding land before speaking her quoted text; use a careful, tentative tone for her line.
        - Put a medium pause (—) where em dashes appear; pause slightly longer on the em dash after interruptions or mid-sentence breaks.
        - At the paragraph with only "¶" insert a long, dramatic silence—hold this noticeably longer than other pauses to mark Florence's contemplation.
        - When characters shout or show urgency (e.g., "Kira, wait!" or "We're about to be attacked!"), raise volume and pace briefly, then return to measured delivery.

        I say—"I don't know. But right now, we need you. And *you're the only one who can help us survive this.*"

        Florence looks back toward the window. She says—"They won't listen to me. They don't trust my judgment."

        I say—"The people will listen if the alternative is losing."

        Florence asks—"Will they? Or will they let pride override survival instinct?"

        That's a fair question. I don't have a good answer.

        I say—"Holloway is trying. Really trying to coordinate defense. But tactical thinking isn't their specialty— they're assigning people to positions based on vague principles, not actual strategy. We're going to lose if you don't help."

        Florence makes a sound like rustling leaves—maybe a laugh. "You're very honest."

        I reply—"You were honest too. Eventually. About what you did and why. They didn't want to hear it, but you told them anyway."

        Florence—"And look where that got me."

        I say—"It got you isolated but alive. Which is better than integrated but destroyed by hostile plants."

        ¶

        I add—"Please. I know they hurt you. I know you have every right to be angry and resentful. But I'm asking anyway—help us survive this."

        Florence turns fully to face me. "Why do you care? You're not a plant. This isn't your conflict."

        I say simply—"I live here. These plants have been trying to keep me alive even when they don't know how. They care about me even though I'm different, even though helping me is complicated. And they're about to be attacked because they let me stay. So yes, this is my conflict."

        Scout bounces—emphatic agreement.

        Florence looks at Scout, then back at me. "If I help—and I'm not saying I will—but if I help, it's because you're asking. Not them. You."

        I say—"I'll take that."

        She's quiet for a moment—then she asks, "What are they doing wrong?"

        I say—"Everything. Holloway's assigning defensive positions based on 'everyone stand near something and defend it.' No cohesive strategy, no coordination between defenders, no plan for what happens when the attack actually comes."

        Florence makes a disapproving sound. "Typical. They're thinking about defense as a collection of individual actions, not as a coordinated system."

        I say—"So help me fix that."

        Florence repeats—"They won't listen to me."

        I say—"Then help me understand what needs to happen, and I'll tell them. Make me your proxy if you don't want to face them directly."

        Florence considers it. "That could work. You give them tactical guidance *based on your human military knowledge* or some fiction like that. They listen because it's coming from you, not me."

        I suggest—"Or we could just be honest. Tell them the guidance is from you and they can take it or leave it. But at least give them the option."

        Florence—voice tinged with bitterness—"Honest. Because honesty worked so well for me before."
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Tense, urgent, pleading — keep the narrator measured and clear; let questions snap a bit faster and let Florence's silences hang weightily.

        - For lines beginning with a lead-in like "I say—" or "Florence says—", announce the speaker calmly, then shift into the quoted line without pause.
        - Emphasize *bold* text with stronger volume: "*you're the only one who can help us survive this.*"
        - Treat the paragraph containing only "¶" as a long, dramatic silence — hold noticeably longer than other pauses.
        - For Florence's nonverbal sounds ("makes a sound like rustling leaves") use a soft, amused rustle, then settle back into speech; cue a slight, ironic laugh on "You're very honest."
        - Deliver tactical descriptions (Holloway, defensive positions) with clipped, exasperated clarity — quicker cadence but not rushed.
        - When Scout bounces, add a small, bright vocal inflection to suggest agreement without words.
        - For the final bitter line, lower tone slightly and add a thin edge of hurt or sarcasm: "Honest. Because honesty worked so well for me before."

        I say— "It did, actually. They didn't like what you said, but they heard you. You told them the truth about what you did and why. Maybe they'll hear the truth about how to survive this too."

        Florence says— "You're more optimistic than I am."

        I say— "One of us has to be."

        Scout bounces—agreement, encouragement, hope.

        Florence looks between us.
        "If I come back and they reject my guidance, if they let pride override survival, I'm returning here— I won't watch people get hurt because they're too stubborn to listen."

        I say— "Fair enough."

        Florence looks between us again.
        "And if we survive this, it doesn't mean automatic forgiveness. I'm still the one who lied to them. They're still the ones who exiled me. Those facts don't change."

        I say— "I know."

        Florence admits quietly— "But you're right that Kira being in danger matters more than my resentment— I can be angry about how they treated me *AND* help keep you alive. Both can be true."

        I say— "Both *CAN* be true."

        Florence turns her platform toward the door.
        "Let's go save everyone who hates me."

        I say— "They don't hate you."

        Florence— "Don't they?"

        I say— "They're hurt by you. There's a difference."

        Florence— "Sometimes the difference doesn't matter much. But I suppose we'll find out."

        We head back toward the main facility. Scout bounces ahead, excited—worried—hopeful all at once.

        ¶

        Behind us, through the window, the hostile plants continue gathering.

        The attack is coming.

        And we're about to find out if necessity can override resentment long enough to survive.

  <combined-text>
    Runner and Velvet leave at dawn. I watch them go from the facility entrance—Runner's vines flowing underground, Velvet spreading low and cautious across the surface; they're approaching the hostile plant gathering point with a message of peace, hoping diplomacy works where threats haven't.

    Scout bounces anxiously beside me—doesn't like Runner leaving, doesn't like the tension in the air.

    I say, "They'll be fine"—not sure I believe it.

    Buddy says, "Kira, your heart rate is elevated. Are you worried?"

    I say, "Of course I'm worried, Buddy."

    Buddy says, "I wish I could help more. I'm not I wasn't designed for situations like this."

    I reach up and touch the familiar weight on my wrist. I say, "But you're here. That counts for something."

    Holloway coordinates the defensive preparations—mostly everyone talking through what defensive preparations might look like if we actually knew what we were doing.

    Remedy suggests, "We should reinforce the eastern wall. That's where most territorial markers appeared."

    Holloway says, "But if we concentrate there, they could attack from another direction We need distributed defense."

    Velvet's offshoot by the facility asks, "How distributed? We can't defend everywhere equally."

    Someone mutters, "Florence would know."

    I'm not sure who.

    Awkward silence follows.

    Holloway says, "We're managing without Florence We just need to think strategically."

    Which would be easier if any of them were actually strategic thinkers. Holloway is excellent at coordination and procedures. Remedy understands chemistry and biology. Velvet knows growth patterns. Tactical defense was Florence's specialty, and she's isolated in a far chamber with nobody talking to her.

    Scout bounces—urgent, alert. They're sensing something.

    I ask, "What is it?"

    Scout bounces toward the eastern boundary—there's movement, lots of it.

    Holloway's fruiting bodies contract with alarm. Holloway says, "Already?"

    Remedy suggests, "Maybe the delegation arriving triggered the response. Hostile plants saw it as provocation, not a peace offering."

    Great we're being attacked because we tried to be peaceful.

    An hour passes, then two—the movement Scout sensed doesn't develop into an immediate attack, but the tension keeps ratcheting up. We're all on edge, waiting.

    Finally, Runner and Velvet return.

    The news is written in their postures before they speak. Runner's vines are coiled tight and defensive—gripping nothing but themselves. Velvet's growth is contracted and minimal.

    Holloway says, "Tell us."

    Runner reports, "*They rejected the delegation.*" One vine absently touches the floor—checking, always checking, feeling for vibrations that aren't there. "They wouldn't even let us finish explaining our position. The ground where they gathered was packed hard, hostile like the soil itself was sorry, that's not relevant."

    I ask, "What did they say?"

    Velvet answers, voice flat—
    "That Kira's presence here is 'contamination.' That allowing a non-plant resident violates the natural order of the territory. That our group has been corrupted by accommodating her existence."

    Contamination. Corrupted. Nice.

    Runner hesitates, vines tracing patterns on the floor—her way of thinking.
    Runner says, "They also..." —she trails off but then continues—"They mentioned Florence. Network gossip. The ground near their territory—" she catches herself—"the *GOSSIP.* Someone spreading information about the deception.

    Of course network gossip would reach them. Of course Florence's lie would become ammunition for plants who already hate us.

    Velvet says, "Soon. They're organized, coordinated, confident. This isn't posturing anymore. They intend to drive us out or destroy the facility."

    I add quietly, "With Kira inside."

    Runner says, "They didn't specify what happens to you." —which isn't reassuring.

    Not tactics—I don't know tactics. But I know them. I've been paying attention this whole time. I know Scout is fast and can communicate silently. I know Runner can sense vibrations underground. I know Remedy has chemical compounds that could be weaponized defensively. I know Florence thinks tactically.

    I know my friends.

    I say quietly to Buddy, "Can you track movement? Multiple positions at once?"

    Buddy sounds surprised—"I think so? I wasn't designed for combat scenarios, but my sensors can detect motion and calculate trajectories. Why?"

    I say to Holloway, "Because we might need that. Florence would."

    Multiple plants react negatively. Runner's vines tighten. Remedy's edges contract. Even Velvet makes a disapproving rustling sound.

    Holloway says stiffly, "Florence is not part of this group's defense planning."

    I argue,
    "Florence is the only one who knows tactical defense!"
    "You're all amazing at your specialties, but none of you think like this— you need someone who can coordinate defensive strategy, not just coordinate people doing defensive things."

    Holloway insists,
    "We can figure it out."

    I reply,
    "Can we? Because the hostile plants are organized and coordinated and have a plan. And we have 'everyone stand near different walls and hope for the best.'"

    Runner—one vine wrapping and unwrapping around a wall support to ground her when she's uncertain—says,
    "Kira, Florence broke our trust. Working with her after that deception—"

    I interrupt,
    "*We're about to be attacked!* By plants who want to drive us out or destroy the facility! With me inside! This isn't the time for hurt feelings!"

    Holloway says firmly,
    "It's not about hurt feelings—it's about whether we can trust Florence's guidance when she's proven she'll lie to us."

    I remind them,
    "The guidance was *GOOD.* You admitted that yourself. The source was false but the content was sound."

    Remedy says quietly,
    "We don't need her. We can defend ourselves."

    I look around at them and ask,
    "Can you? Honestly?"

    Nobody answers—because they don't know. They *want* to believe they can defend themselves without Florence, but they're not confident.

    I say,
    "I'm going to ask her for help."

    Holloway starts,
    "Kira—"

    I interrupt,
    "You can stay mad at her after we survive. Right now, we need her tactical thinking, and I'm going to ask her to provide it. You can choose whether to listen to her advice or not. But I'm asking."

    Scout bounces emphatic agreement—*they're Team Ask Florence, apparently.*

    I head toward the far wing before anyone can stop me. Holloway calls after me,
    "Kira, wait!"
    —but I keep walking.

    Florence's chamber is still sparse, still isolated. When I arrive, she's positioned near the small window opening, watching the eastern boundary.

    Florence observes without turning,
    "You can see the hostile plants gathering. They're forming assault positions. Multiple approach vectors, coordinated timing. Professional execution."

    I say bluntly,
    "We need your help."

    Florence's platform rotates slightly to face me,
    "Do you? Or does Holloway need my help while resenting that fact?"

    I answer,
    "Both. All of us need your help—whether we want to admit it or not."

    Florence says,
    "I'm not welcome in the group anymore, Kira. They made that very clear."

    I say,
    "People are about to get hurt. I'm about to be in real danger. Does that matter more than what they said to you two days ago?"

    Florence is quiet for a long moment.

    Florence finally says,
    "That's not fair."

    I reply,
    "None of this is fair. You lied to them, they exiled you, now hostile plants are attacking and we're all going to suffer for it. Fair doesn't enter into the situation."

    Florence asks,
    "What exactly are you asking me to do?"

    I answer,
    "Come back. Provide tactical guidance. Help us defend the facility."

    Florence asks,
    "And after? When the attack is over and I'm not immediately useful anymore?"

    I say—"I don't know. But right now, we need you. And *you're the only one who can help us survive this.*"

    Florence looks back toward the window. She says—"They won't listen to me. They don't trust my judgment."

    I say—"The people will listen if the alternative is losing."

    Florence asks—"Will they? Or will they let pride override survival instinct?"

    That's a fair question. I don't have a good answer.

    I say—"Holloway is trying. Really trying to coordinate defense. But tactical thinking isn't their specialty— they're assigning people to positions based on vague principles, not actual strategy. We're going to lose if you don't help."

    Florence makes a sound like rustling leaves—maybe a laugh. "You're very honest."

    I reply—"You were honest too. Eventually. About what you did and why. They didn't want to hear it, but you told them anyway."

    Florence—"And look where that got me."

    I say—"It got you isolated but alive. Which is better than integrated but destroyed by hostile plants."

    I add—"Please. I know they hurt you. I know you have every right to be angry and resentful. But I'm asking anyway—help us survive this."

    Florence turns fully to face me. "Why do you care? You're not a plant. This isn't your conflict."

    I say simply—"I live here. These plants have been trying to keep me alive even when they don't know how. They care about me even though I'm different, even though helping me is complicated. And they're about to be attacked because they let me stay. So yes, this is my conflict."

    Scout bounces—emphatic agreement.

    Florence looks at Scout, then back at me. "If I help—and I'm not saying I will—but if I help, it's because you're asking. Not them. You."

    I say—"I'll take that."

    She's quiet for a moment—then she asks, "What are they doing wrong?"

    I say—"Everything. Holloway's assigning defensive positions based on 'everyone stand near something and defend it.' No cohesive strategy, no coordination between defenders, no plan for what happens when the attack actually comes."

    Florence makes a disapproving sound. "Typical. They're thinking about defense as a collection of individual actions, not as a coordinated system."

    I say—"So help me fix that."

    Florence repeats—"They won't listen to me."

    I say—"Then help me understand what needs to happen, and I'll tell them. Make me your proxy if you don't want to face them directly."

    Florence considers it. "That could work. You give them tactical guidance *based on your human military knowledge* or some fiction like that. They listen because it's coming from you, not me."

    I suggest—"Or we could just be honest. Tell them the guidance is from you and they can take it or leave it. But at least give them the option."

    Florence—voice tinged with bitterness—"Honest. Because honesty worked so well for me before."

    I say— "It did, actually. They didn't like what you said, but they heard you. You told them the truth about what you did and why. Maybe they'll hear the truth about how to survive this too."

    Florence says— "You're more optimistic than I am."

    I say— "One of us has to be."

    Scout bounces—agreement, encouragement, hope.

    Florence looks between us.
    "If I come back and they reject my guidance, if they let pride override survival, I'm returning here— I won't watch people get hurt because they're too stubborn to listen."

    I say— "Fair enough."

    Florence looks between us again.
    "And if we survive this, it doesn't mean automatic forgiveness. I'm still the one who lied to them. They're still the ones who exiled me. Those facts don't change."

    I say— "I know."

    Florence admits quietly— "But you're right that Kira being in danger matters more than my resentment— I can be angry about how they treated me *AND* help keep you alive. Both can be true."

    I say— "Both *CAN* be true."

    Florence turns her platform toward the door.
    "Let's go save everyone who hates me."

    I say— "They don't hate you."

    Florence— "Don't they?"

    I say— "They're hurt by you. There's a difference."

    Florence— "Sometimes the difference doesn't matter much. But I suppose we'll find out."

    We head back toward the main facility. Scout bounces ahead, excited—worried—hopeful all at once.

    Behind us, through the window, the hostile plants continue gathering.

    The attack is coming.

    And we're about to find out if necessity can override resentment long enough to survive.

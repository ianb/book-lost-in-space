  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only details that change the group's strategic situation or will affect later scenes: the delegation failed and hostile plants escalated to a planned attack; the hostile plants explicitly invoked Florence's deception as justification; Kira decides to involve Florence and Florence conditionally agrees to provide tactical guidance (with Kira as a possible proxy); Holloway resists reintegration on trust grounds; and initial ad-hoc defensive assignments were made. These items matter for future continuity (imminent attack timing, who will advise/lead defense, division of trust inside the facility, and who is responsible for specific defensive tasks). I did not record transient sensory details, exact dialogue, or obvious scene staging. I found no contradictions with the previously established facts — this passage develops and escalates existing threads (hostile plants organizing opposition, Florence's isolation, Kira visiting Florence, etc.) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DELEGATION_REJECTED_BY_HOSTILE_PLANTS">Runner and Velvet's delegation to the hostile plant group was explicitly rejected—the hostile plants would not allow the delegation to finish explaining.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens at dawn (Runner and Velvet leave at dawn). The previous passage ended at night (~23:00), so there is an overnight gap. Within the passage explicit time markers appear: Scout senses movement soon after the delegation leaves, and the narration says "An hour passes. Two." before Runner and Velvet return. After their return there's an immediate flurry of planning and Kira leaves for Florence; the conversation there and return to the facility take additional, but short, time. How much time passes in this passage: roughly 2–3 hours (the explicit "one… two" hours of waiting plus the delegation trip and the planning/conversation windows). The passage ends once Kira and Florence head back toward the main facility with Florence agreeing to help and the hostile plants still gathering — i.e., still morning, before the attack begins. Gap from previous passage: from ~23:00 (previous end) to dawn (~06:00) — about 6–8 hours overnight. Likely activities in that gap: sleep or low-activity overnight watch, final preparation for dawn delegation, people resting/briefly on edge after the prior events. Plausibility: The timeline is plausible. A dawn delegation leaving around ~06:00, scouting/approach, at least an hour or two of contact/observation, and return mid-morning is reasonable. The subsequent short planning meeting, Kira’s quick trip to the far wing, a 10–30 minute tactical discussion, and return to the group before an imminent attack are all plausible within the 2–3 hour span. The story’s implied communications (plants spreading word through a network, quick rapport and decision-making under pressure) are consistent with the established world-building; nothing requires implausibly fast travel or information transfer. One minor note: the phrase "An hour passes. Two." is taken as literal elapsed time, which anchors the mid-morning end; if it were meant figuratively the exact end time would be fuzzier, but nothing in the passage creates a contradiction with the prior-night to dawn jump.</reasoning>
    <starts>dawn (~06:00)</starts>
    <ends>mid-morning (~09:00)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About 6–8 hours (previous ended ~23:00; dawn ~06:00). Likely used for overnight rest/low activity and final preparations for the morning delegation.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The delegation leaving at dawn, the one-to-two hours of waiting/observation, the delegation’s return mid-morning, and a short tactical trip to Florence and back fit comfortably into the timeline. The information spread among plants and the quick decision-making under pressure are consistent with the world as presented and don't demand unrealistic travel or communication speeds.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters listed are those who are named or clearly present in the passage. Kira (the narrator) appears throughout. Runner and Velvet are present at the opening (they leave at dawn) and later return, so they are counted as present; they also explicitly leave early in the passage, so they are listed as having exited during the scene. Scout, Holloway, Remedy, and Florence are all explicitly present and interact in the scene. No other named characters appear. No character newly arrives who wasn’t present at the start, so ENTERED is empty. The only available entity that fits the scene (facility, boundaries, chamber) is the planet card provided, so it’s included as the relevant location.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage raises the immediate external threat and resolves the internal tactical impasse: Runner and Velvet's delegation failed, hostile plants framed Kira as "contamination" and used news of Florence's deception as justification to demand eviction and to plan an imminent coordinated attack. Holloway's group lacks coherent tactical strategy without Florence. Kira breaches Florence's isolation and persuades her to provide defensive guidance conditionally (Florence will help but may withdraw if rejected and forgiveness isn't guaranteed). I consolidated background details (training at Elder Heartwood, extended procedural shifts) into fewer bullets and removed atmospheric/descriptive details, keeping only plot-relevant facts and the new urgent developments.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remained offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded to Kira as perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
      - The collective shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to rely on their own experiential framework rather than distant authority.
      - Florence admitted fabricating most Elder Twist's pronouncements, resigned from a central advisory role, and was isolated in a far wing; the confession fractured trust in Holloway.
      - The group continues to cooperate functionally but remains divided over whether to use Florence's tactics because of the deception; some acknowledge the tactics' effectiveness while others insist on attribution and honesty.
      - Scout discovered organized, aggressive territorial markers along Holloway's eastern boundary that made relocation dangerous for Kira.
      - Runner and Velvet were sent at dawn as a peaceful delegation to the hostile plants while Kira stayed at Holloway.
      - Runner and Velvet returned rejected: hostile plants called Kira "contamination," demanded the group's removal, and cited Florence's deception as proof the group was untrustworthy.
      - The hostile plants are organized, coordinated, and planning an imminent attack intended to drive Holloway out or destroy the facility; Kira's safety is explicitly threatened.
      - Holloway's members scrambled to assign defensive tasks but lacked a cohesive tactical strategy; Florence's exile left a decisive tactical gap.
      - Kira went to Florence despite her exile and asked for tactical help; Florence agreed to provide guidance conditionally and warned she will withdraw if the group refuses to heed her advice.
      - Kira and Florence head back to the main facility with Florence's conditional cooperation to implement coordinated defenses as the hostile attack approaches.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV state: Kira is anxious, urgent, and resolute. The immediate threat (hostile plants organizing an attack) produces mounting dread and physical tension, then spirals into moral frustration and anger over Florence's exile and the group's inability to craft a real defense. That frustration catalyzes Kira's decisive action — she chooses to override group politics and recruit Florence, which is a pragmatic, conciliatory move driven by survival. Reader experience: readers move from suspense and anxiety (imminent attack) into moral ambivalence about Florence's deception and the group's response, and finally into cautious relief and uplift when Kira brokers a fragile truce and a plan to act. Multiple beats: there are three clear emotional beats — escalating dread/tension about the attack, betrayal/frustration at fractured trust and tactical incompetence, and pragmatic hope/ tentative belonging when Kira brings Florence back into the fold. Comparison to pattern so far: this passage repeats the story’s recurring arc (anticipation → dread → acceptance/action) and revisits the betrayal motif (Florence) introduced earlier. However, it escalates stakes (imminent violence rather than long-term bureaucracy) and moves from passive waiting to active problem-solving, so the repetition feels purposeful: the same emotional beats are intensified and drive a decisive turning point rather than prolonging stasis.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="dread, tension">POV: Rising alarm and acute anxiety as the hostile plants coalesce and the facility prepares defensively; Kira feels exposed and fearful for her survival and for the group's readiness. Cause: Scout's warning, reports from Runner/Velvet, and explicit declarations that an attack is coming. Reader: shares suspense and apprehension—the scene tightens into an imminent-threat beat that raises stakes and urgency.</beat>
      <beat tags="betrayal, frustration">POV: Moral hurt and exasperation at the group's paralysis and at Florence's prior deception, which now functions as political ammunition against her return; Kira experiences anger that interpersonal wounds are compromising tactical survival. Cause: Holloway's procedural floundering, plants' specialties not matching tactical needs, and the explicit sense that Florence's lie has undermined trust. Reader: feels ethical ambivalence and irritation—sympathy for both Florence's motives and the group's sense of violation, plus frustration at the lack of a coherent defence.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: Determined, pragmatic hope and a yearning for repaired connection as Kira decides to recruit Florence and Florence tentatively agrees to help; Kira's willingness to bridge the rift is driven by urgency and affection for the plant-group that kept her alive. Cause: realization that Florence's tactical skill is indispensable and Kira's prioritization of survival over pride. Reader: experiences cautious relief and uplift—a tentative emotional payoff as agency replaces paralysis and a fragile pathway toward restored belonging opens.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage executes immediate consequences of the prior scene's decisions (the delegation goes out, is rejected, and the plants escalate), and it advances interpersonal threads (Kira directly recruits Florence to provide tactical guidance, conditionally). Promises that were explicit in the prior open list and that are events or decisions in this passage are marked as fulfilled. Ongoing systemic and mystery threads (navigation/crash mysteries, SAM status, long-term survival constraints, botanical ecology, investigation into which guidance was fabricated, Florence's longer-term reintegration arc, internal trust fracture and the imminent plant threat) remain open because nothing in this passage resolves them — many are, if anything, intensified. A few new, concrete promises are introduced here: the hostile-plant network has received and used the gossip about Florence to justify rejection/attack (firm); the delegation was rejected and the plants intend direct action soon (firm/imminent); Florence agrees to provide tactical help but only conditionally and via Kira as a proxy (firm/conditional); and there's an explicit new looming dramatic question about whether pride will override survival (tentative). No prior open promises are directly contradicted or clearly abandoned in this passage, so I mark none as lapsed.</reasoning>

      <promise id="ORGANIZED_PLANT_OPPOSITION" tentative="false" introduced="29">Hostile plants are organizing collectively and could pressure the group to relocate or otherwise act against them; this passage confirms coordination and escalation.</promise>
      <promise id="RELOCATION_PRESSURE_POTENTIAL" tentative="false" introduced="29">Organized opposition could force the group to abandon the facility (and Kira's critical infrastructure); still an urgent risk given escalation.</promise>
      <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_FRACTURE" tentative="false" introduced="29">Group cohesion and mutual trust have been damaged by Florence's deception at a moment when cohesion is required to face an external threat—the fracture is explicit and unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_REINTEGRATION_DECISION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Pending formal decision whether Florence will be reintegrated into coordinator/interpretation roles (or remain separated/exiled); the group has deferred and will decide later. Florence has agreed to help conditionally, but formal reintegration remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOPE_OF_FABRICATION_INVESTIGATION" tentative="false" introduced="30">Open investigation: which past guidance attributed to Elder Twist was actually Florence's fabrication (the group has begun enumerating incidents but the full scope is unresolved).</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_IDENTITY_ARC" tentative="true" introduced="30">Florence's personal arc of discovering usefulness and authority without borrowing Elder Twist's mantle — a character growth/identity thread continues as she chooses to help despite exile.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ESCALATION_IMMINENT" tentative="false" introduced="31">The boundary markings and rejection of the delegation confirm that the hostile plants are escalating toward a direct attack; imminent confrontation is still expected.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANTS_AWARE_OF_FABRICATION_AND_USE_AS_JUSTIFICATION" tentative="false" introduced="32">The hostile-plant network has received word of Florence's deception and is using that information to justify rejection of diplomacy and to bolster a case for removing the group from territory.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANTS_REJECT_DELEGATION_AND_INTEND_ATTACK" tentative="false" introduced="32">The delegation sent with a peace message was explicitly refused; plants stated that the group is 'contamination' and intend to drive the facility out or destroy it soon—imminent hostile action is now explicit.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_HELP_CONDITIONALLY" tentative="false" introduced="32">Florence agrees to provide tactical guidance to defend the facility, but her help is conditional: she will assist now (at Kira's request) but will retreat if the group rejects her guidance or continues to resent her.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE" tentative="false" introduced="32">Florence proposes (and Kira accepts) that Kira act as a proxy to present tactical guidance to the group if Florence herself is not listened to; Kira will carry Florence's strategy into group planning.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_RETREAT_IF_REJECTED" tentative="false" introduced="32">Florence explicitly states that if she returns and the group rejects her guidance out of pride, she will go back into isolation rather than submit to humiliation — setting a conditional time-box on reintegration.</promise>
      <promise id="PRIDE_MAY_OVERRIDE_SURVIVAL" tentative="true" introduced="32">A tension is introduced as an explicit question: will the group's pride and resentment of Florence prevent them from adopting life-saving guidance? This is a soft-but-critical dramatic question.</promise>

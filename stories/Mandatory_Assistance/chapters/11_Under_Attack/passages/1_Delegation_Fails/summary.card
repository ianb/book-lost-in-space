  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the immediate external threat and the interpersonal Florence-thread. The pre-existing delegation (DAWN_DELEGATION_TO_HOSTILES) actually occurred and failed, so that planned action is paid off; Kira's exclusion from that delegation likewise happened and is therefore resolved. Florence, who had promised to keep offering advice from exile, does in fact offer and then conditionally agrees to re-engage tactically — that prior promise is therefore paid off. Many earlier technical, environmental, and logistical threads (wreck investigation, SAM/Buddy, contamination, navigation, long-term survival logistics, plant-bureaucracy investigations, etc.) are untouched and remain open. New operational promises arise out of the crisis: the hostile plants have moved from marking to intending imminent attack, Kira and Florence set up a conditional re‑engagement where Kira will act as Florence’s proxy, and there is an explicit plan to restructure defense coordination using Florence’s tactical thinking (but execution remains future). No major previous promise is abandoned as moot — instead several are simply unresolved and now more urgent because of the approaching assault.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="DAWN_DELEGATION_TO_HOSTILES">Runner and Velvet approached the hostile plants at dawn as planned; the delegation occurred but was rejected by the plant network.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_EXCLUDED_FROM_DELEGATION">Kira did not attend the delegation (watched Runner and Velvet leave), so the decision to exclude her was enacted.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_OFFER_ADVICE_FROM_EXILE">Florence, previously isolated and exiled, actually provides tactical analysis and agrees (conditionally) to help with defense, fulfilling her promise to keep offering judgment from exile.</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <open>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM">The eastern neighbors have amplified territorial action; that escalation continues and has now moved toward coordinated assault—outcome unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="USE_ADVICE_ANONYMIZED_RISK">The group intends to apply Florence’s tactics while withholding attribution; Kira has volunteered to act as a proxy to present the guidance — plan in motion but not yet executed in defense.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">The fracture in trust (Florence’s deception, exile, resentment) is demonstrably weakening defensive planning and coordination; how this will be remedied is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">Conditions, timeline, and institutional changes required for Florence's reintegration (or others' trust restoration) remain undecided and now more urgent.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence’s emotional trajectory (anger, desire to be useful, conditional help, possible return to exile) is active and unsettled.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">The plants' exact goals, thresholds for negotiation, and willingness to kill or displace residents remain unknown despite the clear intent to attack.</promise>
      <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">The community’s reduced cohesion and morale after the deception/exile episode continues to pose an operational risk to survival and defense.</promise>
      <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Markers and vine demarcations remain an important anthropological and tactical signal — authorship, extent, and intent are still to be investigated.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">Deliberate, deep-gouged boundary marks on the eastern perimeter are still present and are now part of an escalatory sequence; implications and next steps remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="EXTERNAL_RELOCATION_PRESSURE">Coordinated markers and current plant intent imply pressure to relocate or be displaced; whether relocation will be required is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Authority and procedural trust within the plant-human community have been eroded by the deception incident; institutional consequences remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="INTRA_COMMUNITY_VALIDATION">The group's reliance on outcomes and mutual observation as validation is strained; how they will restore reliable validation processes is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="GROUP_DEFENSE_RESTRUCTURE_NEEDED">A new, coordinated defensive system (not just dispersed assignments) is required; Kira and Florence are planning such a restructure but it has not been implemented.</promise>
      <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">The group’s commitment to iterative daily cooperation continues but faces stress from immediate threat and internal fracture.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy’s growing emotional stakes and boundary concerns are active and could influence medical and group decisions during and after the attack.</promise>
      <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal boundary/guide rituals remain relevant in practice as territorial norms are tested by the hostiles; their enforcement and negotiation remain unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">Whether the forest behaves as a distributed organism with political consequences remains central; the network's role in spreading gossip about Florence shows integration but full mapping is incomplete.</promise>
      <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira’s attachments to plant agents (Scout, Holloway, etc.) remain a narrative and practical vulnerability in a situation where community decisions may endanger her.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Securing long-term shelter, supplies and a rescue or relocation strategy remains unresolved and now more precarious given impending attack.</promise>
      <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Immediate resource allocation and redistribution for defense and possible displacement remain unresolved under the stress of attack.</promise>
      <promise id="DEFENSIVE_ROLES_AND_COMMAND">Who will give final tactical orders and how command is structured remains open; Holloway’s coordination style is inadequate for tactical command without Florence's input.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Which elder communications were genuine vs. fabricated by Florence is still to be fully investigated and has political implications across the plant network.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The influence of facility ritual and bureaucratic protocols on decision-making persists as a shaping factor during the crisis and remains unexamined in depth.</promise>
      <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Wreck investigation (samples, nav data, SAM logs), Buddy/SAM unknowns, communications repair, water and medical supply sustainability, and other technical survival threads remain unresolved and are deprioritized but still open.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_IMMINENT_ATTACK">Newly emergent: the hostile plants have rejected diplomacy and stated they will soon attempt to drive the group out or destroy the facility; timing and manner of assault remain to be confronted.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_REENGAGEMENT">Newly introduced: Florence has conditionally agreed to provide tactical guidance to help defend the facility (she will help but retains the option to withdraw if the group rejects her guidance or pride endangers survival).</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_WILL_ACT_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE">Newly introduced: Kira will present Florence’s tactical guidance to the group (as human-sourced or otherwise) if that increases the chance the group will accept it; execution pending.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only details that change the group's strategic situation or will affect later scenes: the delegation failed and hostile plants escalated to a planned attack; the hostile plants explicitly invoked Florence's deception as justification; Kira decides to involve Florence and Florence conditionally agrees to provide tactical guidance (with Kira as a possible proxy); Holloway resists reintegration on trust grounds; and initial ad-hoc defensive assignments were made. These items matter for future continuity (imminent attack timing, who will advise/lead defense, division of trust inside the facility, and who is responsible for specific defensive tasks). I did not record transient sensory details, exact dialogue, or obvious scene staging. I found no contradictions with the previously established facts — this passage develops and escalates existing threads (hostile plants organizing opposition, Florence's isolation, Kira visiting Florence, etc.) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DELEGATION_REJECTED_BY_HOSTILE_PLANTS">Runner and Velvet's delegation to the hostile plant group was explicitly rejected—the hostile plants would not allow the delegation to finish explaining.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_LABEL_KIRA_CONTAMINATION">The hostile plants declared Kira's presence 'contamination' and said allowing a non-plant resident violates the natural order of the territory.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_USE_FLORENCE_DECEPTION_AS_AMMUNITION">Hostile plants referenced network gossip about Florence's deception as confirmation that the facility group lacks integrity and used that as justification for removing the facility.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_INTEND_IMMINENT_ATTACK">The hostile plants are organized, coordinated, and confident; they indicated they intend to drive the facility out or destroy it soon (attack is imminent).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_ASKS_FLORENCE_FOR_HELP">Kira goes to Florence's isolated chamber and explicitly asks Florence to return and provide tactical defense guidance for the facility.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_AGREES_TO_PROVIDE_CONDITIONAL_HELP">Florence agrees, conditionally, to provide tactical guidance: she will help if asked by Kira, but warns she will withdraw back to isolation if the group rejects her guidance or if pride overrides survival.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_TO_ACT_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE_GUIDANCE">Kira offers to act as Florence's proxy—presenting Florence's tactical advice (either attributed honestly or framed as 'human military knowledge') so the group will accept and implement it.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_RESISTS_REINTEGRATING_FLORENCE_IN_DEFENSE_PLANNING">Holloway states Florence is not part of the group's defense planning and resists reintegrating her because of trust concerns stemming from the deception.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_INITIAL_DEFENSIVE_ASSIGNMENTS_MADE">In rapid response planning Holloway assigns roles: Remedy to prepare chemical deterrents on the western approach, Runner to monitor/defend via underground root networks, Velvet (the offshoot maintaining the building) to reinforce structural weak points, and Holloway to coordinate centrally.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues: the passage opens at dawn (Runner and Velvet leave at dawn). The previous passage ended at night (~23:00), so there is an overnight gap. Within the passage explicit time markers appear: Scout senses movement soon after the delegation leaves, and the narration says "An hour passes. Two." before Runner and Velvet return. After their return there's an immediate flurry of planning and Kira leaves for Florence; the conversation there and return to the facility take additional, but short, time. How much time passes in this passage: roughly 2–3 hours (the explicit "one… two" hours of waiting plus the delegation trip and the planning/conversation windows). The passage ends once Kira and Florence head back toward the main facility with Florence agreeing to help and the hostile plants still gathering — i.e., still morning, before the attack begins. Gap from previous passage: from ~23:00 (previous end) to dawn (~06:00) — about 6–8 hours overnight. Likely activities in that gap: sleep or low-activity overnight watch, final preparation for dawn delegation, people resting/briefly on edge after the prior events. Plausibility: The timeline is plausible. A dawn delegation leaving around ~06:00, scouting/approach, at least an hour or two of contact/observation, and return mid-morning is reasonable. The subsequent short planning meeting, Kira’s quick trip to the far wing, a 10–30 minute tactical discussion, and return to the group before an imminent attack are all plausible within the 2–3 hour span. The story’s implied communications (plants spreading word through a network, quick rapport and decision-making under pressure) are consistent with the established world-building; nothing requires implausibly fast travel or information transfer. One minor note: the phrase "An hour passes. Two." is taken as literal elapsed time, which anchors the mid-morning end; if it were meant figuratively the exact end time would be fuzzier, but nothing in the passage creates a contradiction with the prior-night to dawn jump.</reasoning>
    <starts>dawn (~06:00)</starts>
    <ends>mid-morning (~09:00)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About 6–8 hours (previous ended ~23:00; dawn ~06:00). Likely used for overnight rest/low activity and final preparations for the morning delegation.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The delegation leaving at dawn, the one-to-two hours of waiting/observation, the delegation’s return mid-morning, and a short tactical trip to Florence and back fit comfortably into the timeline. The information spread among plants and the quick decision-making under pressure are consistent with the world as presented and don't demand unrealistic travel or communication speeds.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters listed are those who are named or clearly present in the passage. Kira (the narrator) appears throughout. Runner and Velvet are present at the opening (they leave at dawn) and later return, so they are counted as present; they also explicitly leave early in the passage, so they are listed as having exited during the scene. Scout, Holloway, Remedy, and Florence are all explicitly present and interact in the scene. No other named characters appear. No character newly arrives who wasn’t present at the start, so ENTERED is empty. The only available entity that fits the scene (facility, boundaries, chamber) is the planet card provided, so it’s included as the relevant location.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage raises the immediate external threat and resolves the internal tactical impasse: Runner and Velvet's delegation failed, hostile plants framed Kira as "contamination" and used news of Florence's deception as justification to demand eviction and to plan an imminent coordinated attack. Holloway's group lacks coherent tactical strategy without Florence. Kira breaches Florence's isolation and persuades her to provide defensive guidance conditionally (Florence will help but may withdraw if rejected and forgiveness isn't guaranteed). I consolidated background details (training at Elder Heartwood, extended procedural shifts) into fewer bullets and removed atmospheric/descriptive details, keeping only plot-relevant facts and the new urgent developments.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remained offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded to Kira as perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
      - The collective shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to rely on their own experiential framework rather than distant authority.
      - Florence admitted fabricating most Elder Twist's pronouncements, resigned from a central advisory role, and was isolated in a far wing; the confession fractured trust in Holloway.
      - The group continues to cooperate functionally but remains divided over whether to use Florence's tactics because of the deception; some acknowledge the tactics' effectiveness while others insist on attribution and honesty.
      - Scout discovered organized, aggressive territorial markers along Holloway's eastern boundary that made relocation dangerous for Kira.
      - Runner and Velvet were sent at dawn as a peaceful delegation to the hostile plants while Kira stayed at Holloway.
      - Runner and Velvet returned rejected: hostile plants called Kira "contamination," demanded the group's removal, and cited Florence's deception as proof the group was untrustworthy.
      - The hostile plants are organized, coordinated, and planning an imminent attack intended to drive Holloway out or destroy the facility; Kira's safety is explicitly threatened.
      - Holloway's members scrambled to assign defensive tasks but lacked a cohesive tactical strategy; Florence's exile left a decisive tactical gap.
      - Kira went to Florence despite her exile and asked for tactical help; Florence agreed to provide guidance conditionally and warned she will withdraw if the group refuses to heed her advice.
      - Kira and Florence head back to the main facility with Florence's conditional cooperation to implement coordinated defenses as the hostile attack approaches.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV state: Kira is anxious, urgent, and resolute. The immediate threat (hostile plants organizing an attack) produces mounting dread and physical tension, then spirals into moral frustration and anger over Florence's exile and the group's inability to craft a real defense. That frustration catalyzes Kira's decisive action — she chooses to override group politics and recruit Florence, which is a pragmatic, conciliatory move driven by survival. Reader experience: readers move from suspense and anxiety (imminent attack) into moral ambivalence about Florence's deception and the group's response, and finally into cautious relief and uplift when Kira brokers a fragile truce and a plan to act. Multiple beats: there are three clear emotional beats — escalating dread/tension about the attack, betrayal/frustration at fractured trust and tactical incompetence, and pragmatic hope/ tentative belonging when Kira brings Florence back into the fold. Comparison to pattern so far: this passage repeats the story’s recurring arc (anticipation → dread → acceptance/action) and revisits the betrayal motif (Florence) introduced earlier. However, it escalates stakes (imminent violence rather than long-term bureaucracy) and moves from passive waiting to active problem-solving, so the repetition feels purposeful: the same emotional beats are intensified and drive a decisive turning point rather than prolonging stasis.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="dread, tension">POV: Rising alarm and acute anxiety as the hostile plants coalesce and the facility prepares defensively; Kira feels exposed and fearful for her survival and for the group's readiness. Cause: Scout's warning, reports from Runner/Velvet, and explicit declarations that an attack is coming. Reader: shares suspense and apprehension—the scene tightens into an imminent-threat beat that raises stakes and urgency.</beat>
      <beat tags="betrayal, frustration">POV: Moral hurt and exasperation at the group's paralysis and at Florence's prior deception, which now functions as political ammunition against her return; Kira experiences anger that interpersonal wounds are compromising tactical survival. Cause: Holloway's procedural floundering, plants' specialties not matching tactical needs, and the explicit sense that Florence's lie has undermined trust. Reader: feels ethical ambivalence and irritation—sympathy for both Florence's motives and the group's sense of violation, plus frustration at the lack of a coherent defence.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, belonging">POV: Determined, pragmatic hope and a yearning for repaired connection as Kira decides to recruit Florence and Florence tentatively agrees to help; Kira's willingness to bridge the rift is driven by urgency and affection for the plant-group that kept her alive. Cause: realization that Florence's tactical skill is indispensable and Kira's prioritization of survival over pride. Reader: experiences cautious relief and uplift—a tentative emotional payoff as agency replaces paralysis and a fragile pathway toward restored belonging opens.</beat>

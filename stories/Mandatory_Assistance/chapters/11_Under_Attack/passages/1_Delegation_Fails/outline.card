  <pov-inner-life>
    Kira watching the delegation fail, watching her friends flounder—and realizing she KNOWS them. She's been paying attention this whole time. She knows Scout is fast. She knows Florence thinks tactically. She knows what each plant is actually GOOD at. That attention is about to become their greatest asset.

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage moves the standoff into active combat and thus resolves some imminent threats while leaving many strategic and political questions open. The hostile plants' promised assault occurs (so the imminent-attack promise is fulfilled), and Florence's previously theoretical tactical restructure is actually implemented in real time (so the need-for-restructure and the question of who issues tactical orders are paid off). However, Florence's conditional re-engagement remains active (she can still withdraw), the deeper trust- and polity-level problems (rebuilding trust, reputation, authority, longer-term survival and resource constraints, motives of the hostiles, boundary politics, etc.) remain unresolved. Two specific logistical/operational promises from the previous set (Kira acting as an anonymizing proxy and the plan to anonymize Florence’s advice) were abandoned in practice: Florence speaks and commands directly when the attack begins. The passage also introduces several new operational promises/risks that will shape the immediate aftermath (concentration-on-core strategy, resource depletion and infrastructure damage, Runner’s injuries affecting underground defense, secondary chemical hazards from neutralization, and the fragile, necessity-based compliance of the group under Florence). Some foreshadowed items (e.g., hostiles' superior communications and networked tactics) are now manifest as active threats rather than abstract possibilities. In short: immediate tactical salvation is provided by Florence and coordination improves, but structural political, resource, and survival promises remain outstanding and several new operational threats have been set up to be resolved later.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="GROUP_DEFENSE_RESTRUCTURE_NEEDED">Florence's tactical approach (concentrate, coordinate, assign tactical targets) was implemented and produced an effective coordinated defense instead of the previous ad hoc, dispersed responses.</promise>
          <promise id="DEFENSIVE_ROLES_AND_COMMAND">The question of who issues final tactical orders was resolved in practice: Florence provided direct tactical command and Holloway relayed/implemented that coordination.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_IMMINENT_ATTACK">The previously imminent attack actually occurred: hostile plants launched a coordinated, multi-vector assault on the facility.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <lapsed>
          <promise id="USE_ADVICE_ANONYMIZED_RISK">The plan to apply Florence’s tactics while withholding attribution (having Kira present the guidance as her own) was abandoned: Florence gave guidance openly when the attack began.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_WILL_ACT_AS_PROXY_FOR_FLORENCE">Kira's volunteered role as a proxy presenter for Florence's advice was not executed; Florence re-entered and communicated directly, so the proxy plan lapsed.</promise>
        </lapsed>
        <open>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_ESCALATION_AND_CLAIM">The eastern neighbors' escalation has manifested as a coordinated assault; the final outcome (whether the hostiles will drive the group out or be repelled long-term) remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="GROUP_COHESION_IMPACT_ON_DEFENSE">The fracture in trust continues to shape defense effectiveness; while Florence's orders improved coordination under duress, the underlying mistrust among group members remains.</promise>
          <promise id="REBUILD_TRUST_PROCESS">The conditions and timeline for Florence's reintegration (or formal trust restoration) remain undecided despite her current, conditional participation.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_PERSONAL_ARC_AND_REPUTATION">Florence has re-engaged tactically but retains the option to withdraw and her reputation within the group remains damaged; her longer-term emotional and social trajectory is unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_MOTIVATION_UNKNOWN">The deeper goals, thresholds for negotiation, and true willingness of the hostile plants to kill or displace residents remain unclear beyond their demonstrated intent to attack.</promise>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_WEAKENING_RISK">The community's cohesion and morale were brittle under attack; even though they are coordinating now, the longer-term risk from the prior deception/exile episode persists.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_MARKERS_SOCIAL_SIGNS">Territorial markers and vine demarcations remain relevant to the conflict and social signaling, but their full authorship, meaning, and tactical implications remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKERS">The deeper implications of the hostile plants' territorial marks (extent, intent, escalation logic) remain open after the assault began.</promise>
          <promise id="EXTERNAL_RELOCATION_PRESSURE">Whether the group will be forced to relocate or be displaced remains an unresolved pressure now intensified by the attack and facility damage.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_AUTHORITY_TRUST_EROSION">Institutional trust and authority within the plant-human community remain eroded; short-term survival required obedience but institutional consequences are unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="INTRA_COMMUNITY_VALIDATION">Processes by which the group validates claims and expertise are still strained; the crisis forced de facto validation via results, but formal validation processes remain unsettled.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_ITERATIVE_CARE_PRACTICE">The group's ongoing cooperative practices are under stress from the attack and internal fracture; routine care and iteration continue but are jeopardized.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy's emotional stakes and boundary concerns are active (injury, resource strain) and may influence future medical and group decisions; unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BOUNDARY_HANDOFF_RITUAL">Formal rituals around boundaries/guides are under strain and their enforcement or negotiation remains unresolved amid the assault.</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_NETWORK_INTEGRATION">The hostile plants' bioluminescent signaling shows rich networked integration; mapping and political consequences of the forest network remain incomplete.</promise>
          <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's personal attachments (Scout, Runner, Velvet, Holloway) continue to be narrative and practical vulnerabilities now exposed by the assault.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Securing long-term shelter, supplies, and relocation or rescue strategy remains unresolved and is now more precarious given damage and resource depletion.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Immediate resource shortages (Remedy's chemical reserves, injured defenders, damaged infrastructure) are acute and unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TWIST_AUTHENTICITY_INVESTIGATION">Which elder communications in the network were genuine vs. fabricated by Florence remains an open political and investigative thread.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">The role of facility ritual and bureaucratic protocols in shaping decisions remains an unresolved factor under crisis conditions.</promise>
          <promise id="ALL_TECHNICAL_AND_LOGISTICAL_THREADS">Technical/logistical problems (communications repair, water/medical supply sustainability, structural integrity) persist after the breaches and have been deprioritized but remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_REENGAGEMENT">Florence did provide tactical guidance but explicitly retains the condition to withdraw if the group rejects her guidance or lets pride override survival; her reengagement remains conditional and therefore open.</promise>
          <promise id="CORE_CONTRACTION_DEFENSE_STRATEGY">Florence's instruction to abandon the outer areas and contract to a tighter, stronger perimeter around essential systems has been executed and promises a chance to hold the core—but its long-term success and costs remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_DEPLETION_AND_INFRASTRUCTURE_DAMAGE">The facility has sustained significant structural damage, critical systems are threatened, Remedy's stocks are dwindling, and the resource/repair burden remains an ongoing risk.</promise>
          <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_OPERATIONAL_IMPACT">Runner is injured while continuing to fight underground; their impaired state may reduce the group's ability to control subterranean threats going forward.</promise>
          <promise id="TEMPORARY_COMPLIANCE_UNDER_DURESS">The group's compliance with Florence's orders is pragmatic necessity rather than restored trust; that compliance may be temporary and could fray once immediacy subsides.</promise>
          <promise id="CHEMICAL_NEUTRALIZATION_SECONDARY_HAZARD">The neutralization reaction between Remedy's chemicals and hostile spores created toxic sludge that now poses a lingering environmental/hazard problem inside the facility.</promise>
          <promise id="HOSTILES_NETWORK_ADVANTAGE">The hostile plants' superior communications (bioluminescence and signaling) have given them tactical adaptation advantages; understanding and countering that network remains an outstanding challenge.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I selected only durable, plot-relevant changes and facts that will affect future scenes (who is able to act, resource status, strategic posture, injuries, and the facility's structural state). I excluded transient details (specific dialogue lines, momentary reactions, exact timestamps, Scout’s immediate bounces) and small descriptive beats that won't matter long-term. The passage primarily records a state-change: the hostile plants have launched a coordinated assault and Florence has returned and imposed a new, effective defense strategy. Those changes alter characters' roles (Florence re-entering command), resource availability (Remedy running low, toxic sludge), and physical conditions (multiple breaches, Runner injured, core contraction) — all items that must be remembered for continuity. I found no contradictions with previously established facts; this passage develops and advances existing threads (hostile-plant threat, Florence’s conditional role, Runner/Remedy/Velvet responsibilities) rather than overturning them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_RETURNED_TO_COMMON_AREA">Florence has returned to the facility's common area and is physically present, creating immediate tension and taking an active tactical role.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ATTACK_INITIATED">The hostile plants have launched a coordinated, multi-directional assault on the facility, breaching walls from east, west, south (and later north) and attacking from underground.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_USE_THORNS_SPORES_CORROSIVE_VINES">Hostile plants employ multiple offensive methods during the assault, including projectile thorns, toxic spore clouds, and creeping/corrosive vines that dissolve or wither plant growth and structural material.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_COMMUNICATE_BIOLUMINESCENT_SIGNALS">Hostile plants use rapid bioluminescent flashing as an active communication/coordination channel during the assault.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_INJURED_DURING_ATTACK">Runner is injured during underground fighting: vines are torn and leaking sap, and Runner resurfaces briefly but remains engaged underground.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_HIT_BY_DEBRIS_AND_RESOURCES_LOW">Remedy was struck by falling debris and is injured; Remedy is also running low on chemical/defensive compound reserves while continuing to produce targeted countermeasures.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_NEUTRALIZATION_SLUDGE_FORMS">Remedy's airborne counter-chemical reacted with the hostile spore cloud producing a toxic/inert sludge that settled onto the floor, creating a new contamination/hazard to avoid.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_DAMAGED_BY_SPORES">Velvet's defensive growth was damaged/withering where hostile spore clouds settled, reducing some defensive capabilities.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_CONTRACTS_DEFENSIVE_PERIMETER">Velvet abandoned attempts to seal all outer breaches and instead contracted a tighter, thicker defensive barrier around the facility's core (life support, medical systems, and Kira).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSIVE_STRATEGY_SHIFT_TO_CORE">Under Florence's direction the group adopted a prioritized defense: accept/abandon lost outer sections, concentrate on defending the core systems, and reallocate efforts to targeted tactical objectives.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_TARGETS_LOAD_BEARING_ROOTS">Runner shifted from broad underground engagement to focused attacks on key load-bearing/structural hostile roots to destabilize the attackers' assault structure.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_COORDINATING_DEFENSE">Holloway moved from reactive shouting to actively coordinating timing and information flow among defenders (linking Runner, Remedy, Velvet actions) under Florence's guidance.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PROVIDES_EFFECTIVE_TACTICAL_COMMAND">Florence's tactical guidance (concentrate on core, target spore clouds, focus Runner on critical roots) materially improved coordination and allowed defenders to hold rather than merely react.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_CORE_DEFENDED_BUT_STRUCTURALLY_DAMAGED">The facility sustained severe structural damage (multiple breaches, collapsed ceiling sections, destabilized floors) but is now contracting into and defending a damaged but held core area; external/outer areas are being abandoned.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTIVE_AND_CAPABLE">The hostile plants demonstrated professional-level, adaptive tactics (planned escalation, coordinated multi-front pushes) and were able to adapt rapidly — they expected the defenders to continue unfocused defense and had contingency escalation plans.</fact>
        </established>

      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the text: the previous passage ends mid-morning (~09:00) with Kira fetching Florence and the line "The attack is coming." The current passage opens with "Florence's return to the common area" and immediately follows with the eastern wall bursting inward—so the passage begins very shortly after the end of the previous passage. Internal timing in this passage includes an explicit short countdown: Florence predicts an escalation in two minutes and that escalation occurs, so at minimum the passage spans a few minutes. The sequence of events covers: Florence re-entering the common area, immediate breach(s), a period of active fighting with multiple breaches, coordination changes, Florence issuing directives, two-minute escalation, and stabilization into a contracted defense. That whole sequence plausibly takes on the order of tens of minutes (not hours).</reasoning>
        <starts>~09:05</starts>
        <ends>~09:20</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>About 10–20 minutes. During this gap Kira walked to Florence's chamber, convinced her to return (including the conversation and decision), and they walked back to the common area. Meanwhile the hostile plants finished preparing and launched their assault.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The hostile plants were already gathering in the previous passage and "the attack is coming," so an attack beginning within minutes is consistent. The internal two-minute escalation cue anchors the short-term pacing and supports the estimate. The defenders' initial chaotic reaction and then rapid shift to coordinated defense under Florence's orders is believable in this window—especially given Florence's prior tactical knowledge and the plants' ability to act quickly. Minor caveat: some recovery actions (e.g., Remedy refocusing chemicals, Runner changing underground targets, Velvet rapidly restructuring barriers) happen fast, but these are framed as plant abilities and rapid biological responses, so the timing remains credible within the story's established mechanics.</plausibility>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage shows Florence returning to the common area, immediate hostile attack from organized plants on all sides, and the Holloway collective initially responding chaotically. Key tactical events: breaches on multiple walls, toxic spore clouds, Remedy's broad chemical counter producing sludge, Runner fighting underground and getting injured, Scout protecting Kira, and structural collapse. Florence intervenes with decisive orders to abandon outer areas and concentrate defense around the core (life support, medical, Kira), directs Velvet to contract a tighter perimeter, Remedy to target spores, Runner to sever load-bearing roots, and Holloway to coordinate communications. Holloway accepts and begins executing the coordinated defense; the group holds the next coordinated push but the facility is heavily damaged and resources strained. I consolidated earlier bullets about Florence's confession/isolation and the Runner/Velvet delegation into briefer points since current events make tactical alignment and the ongoing attack the immediate plot drivers.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
          - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
          - The collective shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to rely more on their own experiential framework.
          - Florence confessed fabricating most of Elder Twist's pronouncements, resigned and was isolated; the confession fractured trust but functional cooperation continued amid division over using her tactics.
          - Scout discovered aggressive territorial markers along Holloway's eastern boundary making relocation dangerous.
          - Runner and Velvet visited the hostile plants and were rejected; hostile plants labeled Kira "contamination," demanded Holloway's removal, and were revealed to be organized and planning an imminent attack.
          - Holloway lacked a cohesive tactical strategy; Kira sought Florence out, and Florence agreed to offer conditional tactical guidance if the group would follow it.
          - Florence returned to the common area, creating immediate tension; hostile plants launched a coordinated assault, breaching walls from multiple sides and attacking from underground with spores, thorns, and corrosive vines.
          - Initial defense was reactive and disorganized: walls, floor, and ceiling were damaged; Remedy's broad chemical counter reacted with hostile spores to form toxic sludge; Runner fought underground and was injured; Scout protected Kira.
          - Florence imposed a focused strategy: abandon outer sections and concentrate on defending the core (life support, medical, Kira); Velvet was ordered to contract the perimeter inward, Remedy to target spore clouds specifically, Runner to sever load-bearing hostile roots, and Holloway to coordinate communications between defenders.
          - Holloway accepted Florence's guidance and began coordinated responses; the new tactics blunted a subsequent coordinated push—holding the core but leaving the facility badly damaged, resources depleted, Runner injured, and the threat likely to escalate.
          - Florence remains the tactical coordinator; the plants follow her directives pragmatically despite distrust, giving Holloway a fighting chance but not resolving their larger resource and safety crisis.

      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>POV (Kira) moves quickly from immediate alarm to frustrated helplessness and then to pragmatic relief as Florence's tactics convert chaotic defense into coordinated action. At first Kira is terrified and scrambling — physical danger (toxic spores, breaches, collapsing ceiling, roots grabbing her) produces high, visceral fear and urgency. That fear shades into anger/exasperation and despair as she watches the facility and its caretakers react reflexively without a strategy. When Florence finally issues clear, hard decisions (abandon outer areas, concentrate the core, target specific roots/spores) Kira experiences a tense but grateful acceptance and cautious hope: the defense is now purposeful and they have a fighting chance, even though the situation remains dire. The reader's arc mirrors this: intense suspense and dread in the attack, rising frustration at the defenders' disorganization, then a relieved uplift and renewed engagement when coordinated tactics kick in — but lingering anxiety because resources and injuries are real constraints. There are multiple beats (alarm → frustrated helplessness → tactical hope) rather than a single tone. This passage continues the story's recurring pattern of anticipation/dread shifting into acceptance, but it heightens immediacy and stakes (active warfare) and folds back the betrayal/Trust fracture motif into pragmatic cooperation: the emotional repetition (dread→acceptance) persists, but the stakes and tempo are escalated, keeping the pattern from feeling stale.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="tension, dread">Immediate, visceral alarm: Kira is panicked and physically threatened when hostile roots, toxic spores, and structural collapse hit the facility. The onset is sudden and sensory (cold room, grabbing roots, toxic clouds), producing an acute fight-or-flight reaction. Reader experience: high suspense and fear for Kira's safety; the scene induces adrenaline and close, breathless engagement.</beat>
          <beat tags="frustration, dread">Helpless, exasperated overwhelm: Kira shifts to frustrated anger and despair as the defenders react reflexively—'panic and react'—rather than with strategy; watching loved allies (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) get overwhelmed intensifies her dread. Reader experience: growing irritation at chaotic, ineffective defense and a deeper anxiety about the group's likely failure; moral frustration compounds the physical danger.</beat>
          <beat tags="acceptance, hope">Pragmatic acceptance and cautious hope: when Florence issues hard tactical orders and Holloway starts coordinating, Kira experiences relief mixed with weary acceptance—not trust restored, but an operational truce that offers a real chance. Reader experience: a cathartic uplift and renewed investment as coordination replaces chaos, tempered by lingering worry about damage, resource limits, and injuries. Pattern note: this resolves the immediate panic into the story's familiar acceptance/hope beat but with heightened stakes and urgency.</beat>

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage converts a lot of prior setup into action: the hostile plants' intent becomes an actual coordinated assault; Buddy's proposed multi-position tracking is tested and works; Kira's decision to act as a proxy/coordinator is executed; Florence's conditional return is enacted and her tactical guidance is implemented. I treated promises as fulfilled when the specific action or capability flagged in the previous open-promises actually occurred in the passage (e.g., Buddy tracking multiple masses; Kira coordinating defense; the hostile plants attacking). I left broader, ongoing social/character threads open when they remain unresolved (trust, exile, identity, resentment) or when the original condition/possibility remains active (Florence could still withdraw if rejected). I did not mark as new any tactical decisions that were both introduced and immediately implemented within this passage (for example, contracting the perimeter) because the instruction disallows listing promises that are introduced and fulfilled in the same passage as new promises. I did introduce a small number of new, forward-facing promises that were stated here and remain unresolved (Florence's explicit withdraw-if-rejected condition, resource shortage as an escalating risk, and continued evidence that the hostiles will adapt/escalate). No prior open promise was obviously abandoned or rendered moot in this passage; instead most were either paid off by action or remain relevant going forward.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage documents a major escalation: the previously foreshadowed hostile-plant faction launches a full, coordinated assault on the facility, producing sustained structural damage and casualties, and Florence (previously isolated) returns and successfully imposes a tactical approach that changes the defenders from chaotic reaction to coordinated defense. Significant long-term facts: the attack actually occurred and inflicted real damage and injuries (Runner, Remedy, Velvet; facility structural damage); hostile forces use specific tactics (spore clouds, projectile thorns, corrosive vines, coordinated underground networks); Florence's tactical competence is proven and the group adopts her ‘contract-to-core’ strategy under duress; Buddy contributes usable tactical tracking data. These facts matter later for resources, morale, trust dynamics, repair/rehab timelines, and strategic posture toward hostile plants. There are no contradictions with previously established facts—the passage develops and confirms earlier foreshadowing (hostile plants intended to attack, Florence’s conditional aid, Buddy’s tracking ability) rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ATTACK_BEGINS">The hostile-plant faction initiated a coordinated, multi-directional assault on the facility, breaching walls and attacking from above, laterally, and underground.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_SUSTAINS_MAJOR_DAMAGE">The facility sustained major structural damage during the assault (multiple wall breaches, sections of ceiling collapsed, floor destabilized, pervasive structural failure threatening core systems).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_INJURED_DURING_ATTACK">Runner was injured in the underground fighting (vines torn, leaking sap) and continues to engage despite wounds.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_INJURED_AND_CHEMICAL_RESERVES_LOW">Remedy was struck by falling debris and is injured; Remedy's chemical/defensive reagent reserves are becoming depleted during the engagement.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_DAMAGED_AND_CONTRACTS_PERIMETER">Velvet sustained damage from spore attacks and corrosion; on Florence's orders Velvet contracted its defensive barrier inward to form a tighter perimeter protecting the facility core and essential systems.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_REENTERED_COMMON_AREA_AND_OFFERED_TACTICS">Florence returned to the common area (ending her prior isolation) and offered tactical guidance during the attack, positioning herself as the tactical coordinator on her mobile platform.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PROVIDES_EFFECTIVE_TACTICAL_COMMAND">Florence's tactical directives (abandon outer defenses, concentrate on the core, target load-bearing roots, coordinate Remedy/Runner/Velvet actions) materially improved the defenders' coordination and turned the situation from chaotic defense to a working, strategic posture.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSE_STRATEGY_CONTRACT_TO_CORE_PRIORITIZE_LIFE_SUPPORT_MEDICAL_AND_KIRA">The defenders adopted a deliberate strategy to abandon indefensible outer areas and concentrate defense on a contracted inner perimeter protecting life support, medical equipment, and Kira; this prioritization guided subsequent actions.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANT_TACTICS_DEFINED">Hostile plants employed combined tactics including airborne spore clouds (toxin), projectile thorns, corrosive/decaying creeping vines that dissolve defenders, and a coordinated underground root network to destabilize foundations.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_PROVIDES_REALTIME_TACTICAL_TRACKING">Buddy actively provided real-time tactical tracking (identifying multiple distinct hostile masses, underground groups, trajectories) and relayed that data to defenders and to Florence, becoming a useful part of coordination.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENDERS_BEGIN_HOLDING_UNDER_COORDINATION">After adopting Florence's tactics and using Buddy's tracking, the facility defenders began to hold against coordinated assaults (repelling coordinated pushes and stabilizing key breaches), though the facility remained badly damaged and resources strained.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>Temporal cues in the two passages show immediate continuity. The previous-passage authoritative end time is 2687-04-22T10:00 (per the provided outline). The previous passage closes with the group returning to the facility and the line "The attack is coming," which implies the attack begins immediately after that moment. The current passage opens with Florence entering the common area and the eastern wall bursting inward — an immediate event. Internal timing markers in the current passage include a specific short countdown: Florence predicts escalation in "two minutes," and that escalation occurs two minutes later. The passage describes an initial chaotic phase (breaches, spore clouds, chemical neutralization producing sludge, Runner fighting underground, ceiling collapse), then Florence gives orders, the group adjusts, and a coordinated escalation happens two minutes after Florence's prediction. The whole sequence covers the initial breach, improvised defense, the switch to coordinated tactics, and the immediate aftermath where the group is "holding" but still in danger. That series of events plausibly fits into a short firefight measured in minutes rather than hours. Taking the authoritative previous end time (2687-04-22T10:00) as the start, the passage plausibly spans on the order of several to perhaps a dozen minutes; I estimate about ten minutes from initial breach through the escalation and the point where Florence's tactics stabilize the defense enough to "hold." If one used the alternate 08:00 estimate shown elsewhere, the gap would be implausibly large given the narrative immediacy; therefore I used the authoritative 10:00 timestamp as instructed.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-22T10:00</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-22T10:10</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation (0 minutes). The previous passage ends with "The attack is coming," and this passage shows the attack beginning at once, so there is no substantive gap.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The attack and defensive actions described (rapid wall breaches, spore clouds, chemical neutralization producing sludge, underground root fighting, structural collapse, and a two-minute predicted escalation) can reasonably occur and be resolved to the point of reorganizing defenses within ~10 minutes. The explicit "two minutes" marker inside the passage supports a short timeline, and the characters' immediate reactions, rapid chemical reactions, and plant growth all fit the story's established capabilities. The only timing concern would arise if one used the alternate 08:00 summary timestamp instead of the provided authoritative 10:00 end time for the prior passage; that would imply a multi-hour gap inconsistent with the narrative's present-tense continuity. Using the authoritative 10:00 endpoint, the timeline is coherent and plausible.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>All characters referenced in the passage are plants and crew already present at the end of the previous passage. The passage features active participation or mention of Kira (narrator), Buddy, Scout, Holloway, Remedy, Runner, Velvet, and Florence. No new characters enter during this scene and no characters explicitly leave before the scene ends. The only external reference is to “Mav” (Maverick), but he is not in the provided character list; however the passage invokes a media/persona tied to the available entity "/world/entities/Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone.card," so I include that entity as relevant. No other listed entity (Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet) is mentioned or clearly relevant in this passage.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage describes an immediate, coordinated assault by the hostile plants and a turning point in the collective’s defense when Florence intervenes with concrete tactics. I added bullets for the attack's nature (multi-directional breaches, spores, projectiles, underground network), key actions and casualties (Remedy’s neutralization creating sludge, Runner injured, Scout luring spores), Buddy’s effective tracking, and Florence’s tactical plan and its effects (contract perimeter, targeted roles for Remedy/Runner/Velvet, Holloway relays). I consolidated earlier items that were repetitive (Buddy’s sensing ability now stated as actively used in combat) and removed purely atmospheric details while keeping status items that affect survival (facility damage, depleted resources, fragile trust). The updated list stays chronological and focuses on events and decisions that shape what happens next.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - A shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link activated an assistant AI (Buddy); external communications and the ship’s distress beacon are broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found, sheltered Kira, and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg; cooperative caregiving among plants improved her condition.
          - The collective moved toward self-reliance after external authorities and manuals failed to provide usable guidance.
          - Scouts discovered deliberate hostile boundary markings to the east; a delegation (Runner and Velvet) sent a coexistence message and was rejected; hostile plants labeled Kira 'contamination' and mobilized an organized attack.
          - The collective scrambled ad hoc defenses under Holloway’s coordination but lacked coherent strategy; Buddy could detect and track motion and movement patterns.
          - Kira persuaded Florence to provide tactical guidance conditionally; Florence agreed to help if the group would accept her counsel.
          - Florence’s return increased immediate tension within the common area, with plant members wary of her presence.
          - The hostile plants launched a coordinated, multi-directional assault—roots and vines breached east, west, south, and later north; bioluminescent signaling indicated complex coordination.
          - Hostiles used toxic spore clouds and projectile thorns; spores withered moss and created airborne hazards; one spore cloud collided with Remedy’s neutralizer producing toxic sludge that settled on the floor.
          - Underground hostiles attacked the facility’s foundation; Runner engaged subterranean networks but was injured while severing key roots; sections of ceiling and walls collapsed and the facility sustained heavy structural damage.
          - Scout was used to bait and redirect a spore cloud away from the core; Buddy actively tracked multiple hostile masses and provided actionable movement data during combat.
          - Initial defensive responses were reactive and fragmented, but Florence intervened with a tactical plan: abandon indefensible outer areas, contract and fortify a tight perimeter around core systems and Kira, and assign focused roles—Velvet to form the inner barrier, Remedy to target spore threats, Runner to sever load-bearing hostile roots, Holloway to coordinate communication between defenders.
          - The collective implemented Florence’s strategy: Velvet contracted a denser inner barrier, Remedy shifted to targeted anti-spore chemistry, Runner focused on destabilizing key roots, and Holloway began relaying tactical information—coordination turned a failing defense into a holding action.
          - Despite the improved coordination, the facility remains badly damaged, supplies and chemical reserves are low, Runner is injured, Velvet is strained, hostiles continue their assault, and trust toward Florence and between group members remains fragile; the group is holding for now but the situation is precarious and escalation is expected.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV (Kira): immediate, visceral terror that the facility is being ripped apart — frantic, overwhelmed, protective (especially of Scout and the core systems). That fear fast-forwards into focused clarity and authority: Kira moves from alarm to decisive command, improvising tactical assignments, trusting Buddy's sensors, and explicitly recruiting Florence's counsel. By the end she feels cautious relief and pragmatic hope because the group shifts from scattered reaction to coordinated defense.

          Reader experience: a rush of panic and sensory chaos (roots, spores, collapsing ceiling) that mirrors Kira's physiological reactions; then a sharp emotional pivot to exhilaration and relief as improvisation becomes strategy. The passage delivers high-stakes suspense that resolves into a tense, earned uplift — not victory, but the necessary shift to having a chance.

          Multiple beats vs single tone: there are multiple clear emotional beats here: escalating dread/chaos, emergent determination/leadership, and guarded relief/hope. The dominant movement is from dread to determined coordination.

          Comparison to story so far: this passage continues and accelerates the arc that ended with fractured trust and the imminent attack. Previously the group was paralyzed by moral conflict about Florence; here that internal conflict is abruptly roofed over by existential threat, and Kira concretely assumes a mediating/leadership role. The emotional arc tightens: where earlier sections emphasized uncertainty and broken trust, this scene forces pragmatic cooperation under fire and shows the group shifting from procedural/bureaucratic habits to tactical improvisation.

          Surprises: there is a notable situational reversal — the symbolic/debated moment (Florence's re-entry and the trust fight) is immediately validated by the attack, forcing the group to accept Florence's tactics. This timing and reversal (argument -&gt; instant attack -&gt; Florence proven right) is emotionally and narratively striking, even if an attack was already expected. There are no hidden secrets revealed here, but existing character traits (Florence's tactical competence; Buddy's practical usefulness) are concretely demonstrated under pressure, converting disputed qualities into indispensable assets.

          Character change: the scene advances several characters in practical, behavioral ways. Kira cements her role as an active coordinator and risk-taker rather than passive mediator; Holloway makes the hard organizational choice to set aside pride and accept guidance; Florence converts competence and culpability into actionable leadership (though not yet full social forgiveness); Buddy transitions from curious companion to operational sensor/partner. These are developments along lines already established, but each is made concrete and consequential by the immediate threat.

        <beats>
          <beat tags="dread, suspense">Immediate terror and chaos as hostile roots, spores, and collapsing structure assault the facility. Kira feels acute fear (physiological alarm, concern for Scout and the group) and the reader experiences high, visceral suspense as the attack unfolds in staccato sensory detail.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, conflict">Kira pivots to decisive action—calling tactics, delegating roles, trusting Buddy's sensor data, and pressing for Florence's input. The emotion shifts from panic to focused determination; the reader experiences a surge of agency and moral tension as fractured relationships are subordinated to survival.</beat>
          <beat tags="relief, hope">Tentative relief as Florence's concentrated-tactics plan brings coordinated defense into effect. The group moves from isolated reactive gestures to strategic cooperation; the reader feels an earned uplift—not triumph, but a realistic chance to hold, producing cautious hope.</beat>

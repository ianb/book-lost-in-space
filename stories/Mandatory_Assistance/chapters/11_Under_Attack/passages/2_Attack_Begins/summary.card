  <facts>
    <reasoning>I selected only durable, plot-relevant changes and facts that will affect future scenes (who is able to act, resource status, strategic posture, injuries, and the facility's structural state). I excluded transient details (specific dialogue lines, momentary reactions, exact timestamps, Scout’s immediate bounces) and small descriptive beats that won't matter long-term. The passage primarily records a state-change: the hostile plants have launched a coordinated assault and Florence has returned and imposed a new, effective defense strategy. Those changes alter characters' roles (Florence re-entering command), resource availability (Remedy running low, toxic sludge), and physical conditions (multiple breaches, Runner injured, core contraction) — all items that must be remembered for continuity. I found no contradictions with previously established facts; this passage develops and advances existing threads (hostile-plant threat, Florence’s conditional role, Runner/Remedy/Velvet responsibilities) rather than overturning them.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_RETURNED_TO_COMMON_AREA">Florence has returned to the facility's common area and is physically present, creating immediate tension and taking an active tactical role.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ATTACK_INITIATED">The hostile plants have launched a coordinated, multi-directional assault on the facility, breaching walls from east, west, south (and later north) and attacking from underground.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_USE_THORNS_SPORES_CORROSIVE_VINES">Hostile plants employ multiple offensive methods during the assault, including projectile thorns, toxic spore clouds, and creeping/corrosive vines that dissolve or wither plant growth and structural material.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_COMMUNICATE_BIOLUMINESCENT_SIGNALS">Hostile plants use rapid bioluminescent flashing as an active communication/coordination channel during the assault.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_INJURED_DURING_ATTACK">Runner is injured during underground fighting: vines are torn and leaking sap, and Runner resurfaces briefly but remains engaged underground.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_HIT_BY_DEBRIS_AND_RESOURCES_LOW">Remedy was struck by falling debris and is injured; Remedy is also running low on chemical/defensive compound reserves while continuing to produce targeted countermeasures.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_NEUTRALIZATION_SLUDGE_FORMS">Remedy's airborne counter-chemical reacted with the hostile spore cloud producing a toxic/inert sludge that settled onto the floor, creating a new contamination/hazard to avoid.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_DAMAGED_BY_SPORES">Velvet's defensive growth was damaged/withering where hostile spore clouds settled, reducing some defensive capabilities.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_CONTRACTS_DEFENSIVE_PERIMETER">Velvet abandoned attempts to seal all outer breaches and instead contracted a tighter, thicker defensive barrier around the facility's core (life support, medical systems, and Kira).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSIVE_STRATEGY_SHIFT_TO_CORE">Under Florence's direction the group adopted a prioritized defense: accept/abandon lost outer sections, concentrate on defending the core systems, and reallocate efforts to targeted tactical objectives.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_TARGETS_LOAD_BEARING_ROOTS">Runner shifted from broad underground engagement to focused attacks on key load-bearing/structural hostile roots to destabilize the attackers' assault structure.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_COORDINATING_DEFENSE">Holloway moved from reactive shouting to actively coordinating timing and information flow among defenders (linking Runner, Remedy, Velvet actions) under Florence's guidance.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_PROVIDES_EFFECTIVE_TACTICAL_COMMAND">Florence's tactical guidance (concentrate on core, target spore clouds, focus Runner on critical roots) materially improved coordination and allowed defenders to hold rather than merely react.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_CORE_DEFENDED_BUT_STRUCTURALLY_DAMAGED">The facility sustained severe structural damage (multiple breaches, collapsed ceiling sections, destabilized floors) but is now contracting into and defending a damaged but held core area; external/outer areas are being abandoned.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTIVE_AND_CAPABLE">The hostile plants demonstrated professional-level, adaptive tactics (planned escalation, coordinated multi-front pushes) and were able to adapt rapidly — they expected the defenders to continue unfocused defense and had contingency escalation plans.</fact>

    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>Temporal cues in the text: the previous passage ends mid-morning (~09:00) with Kira fetching Florence and the line "The attack is coming." The current passage opens with "Florence's return to the common area" and immediately follows with the eastern wall bursting inward—so the passage begins very shortly after the end of the previous passage. Internal timing in this passage includes an explicit short countdown: Florence predicts an escalation in two minutes and that escalation occurs, so at minimum the passage spans a few minutes. The sequence of events covers: Florence re-entering the common area, immediate breach(s), a period of active fighting with multiple breaches, coordination changes, Florence issuing directives, two-minute escalation, and stabilization into a contracted defense. That whole sequence plausibly takes on the order of tens of minutes (not hours).</reasoning>
    <starts>~09:05</starts>
    <ends>~09:20</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About 10–20 minutes. During this gap Kira walked to Florence's chamber, convinced her to return (including the conversation and decision), and they walked back to the common area. Meanwhile the hostile plants finished preparing and launched their assault.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The hostile plants were already gathering in the previous passage and "the attack is coming," so an attack beginning within minutes is consistent. The internal two-minute escalation cue anchors the short-term pacing and supports the estimate. The defenders' initial chaotic reaction and then rapid shift to coordinated defense under Florence's orders is believable in this window—especially given Florence's prior tactical knowledge and the plants' ability to act quickly. Minor caveat: some recovery actions (e.g., Remedy refocusing chemicals, Runner changing underground targets, Velvet rapidly restructuring barriers) happen fast, but these are framed as plant abilities and rapid biological responses, so the timing remains credible within the story's established mechanics.</plausibility>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage shows Florence returning to the common area, immediate hostile attack from organized plants on all sides, and the Holloway collective initially responding chaotically. Key tactical events: breaches on multiple walls, toxic spore clouds, Remedy's broad chemical counter producing sludge, Runner fighting underground and getting injured, Scout protecting Kira, and structural collapse. Florence intervenes with decisive orders to abandon outer areas and concentrate defense around the core (life support, medical, Kira), directs Velvet to contract a tighter perimeter, Remedy to target spores, Runner to sever load-bearing roots, and Holloway to coordinate communications. Holloway accepts and begins executing the coordinated defense; the group holds the next coordinated push but the facility is heavily damaged and resources strained. I consolidated earlier bullets about Florence's confession/isolation and the Runner/Velvet delegation into briefer points since current events make tactical alignment and the ongoing attack the immediate plot drivers.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crash killed Jensen and Reed; Kira survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy active.
      - Holloway plant collective rescued and treated Kira; Scout bonded as a perimeter scout and remained fiercely loyal.
      - The collective shifted from rigid, protocol-driven care to iterative, patient-specific collaborative practices and resolved to rely more on their own experiential framework.
      - Florence confessed fabricating most of Elder Twist's pronouncements, resigned and was isolated; the confession fractured trust but functional cooperation continued amid division over using her tactics.
      - Scout discovered aggressive territorial markers along Holloway's eastern boundary making relocation dangerous.
      - Runner and Velvet visited the hostile plants and were rejected; hostile plants labeled Kira "contamination," demanded Holloway's removal, and were revealed to be organized and planning an imminent attack.
      - Holloway lacked a cohesive tactical strategy; Kira sought Florence out, and Florence agreed to offer conditional tactical guidance if the group would follow it.
      - Florence returned to the common area, creating immediate tension; hostile plants launched a coordinated assault, breaching walls from multiple sides and attacking from underground with spores, thorns, and corrosive vines.
      - Initial defense was reactive and disorganized: walls, floor, and ceiling were damaged; Remedy's broad chemical counter reacted with hostile spores to form toxic sludge; Runner fought underground and was injured; Scout protected Kira.
      - Florence imposed a focused strategy: abandon outer sections and concentrate on defending the core (life support, medical, Kira); Velvet was ordered to contract the perimeter inward, Remedy to target spore clouds specifically, Runner to sever load-bearing hostile roots, and Holloway to coordinate communications between defenders.
      - Holloway accepted Florence's guidance and began coordinated responses; the new tactics blunted a subsequent coordinated push—holding the core but leaving the facility badly damaged, resources depleted, Runner injured, and the threat likely to escalate.
      - Florence remains the tactical coordinator; the plants follow her directives pragmatically despite distrust, giving Holloway a fighting chance but not resolving their larger resource and safety crisis.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV (Kira) moves quickly from immediate alarm to frustrated helplessness and then to pragmatic relief as Florence's tactics convert chaotic defense into coordinated action. At first Kira is terrified and scrambling — physical danger (toxic spores, breaches, collapsing ceiling, roots grabbing her) produces high, visceral fear and urgency. That fear shades into anger/exasperation and despair as she watches the facility and its caretakers react reflexively without a strategy. When Florence finally issues clear, hard decisions (abandon outer areas, concentrate the core, target specific roots/spores) Kira experiences a tense but grateful acceptance and cautious hope: the defense is now purposeful and they have a fighting chance, even though the situation remains dire. The reader's arc mirrors this: intense suspense and dread in the attack, rising frustration at the defenders' disorganization, then a relieved uplift and renewed engagement when coordinated tactics kick in — but lingering anxiety because resources and injuries are real constraints. There are multiple beats (alarm → frustrated helplessness → tactical hope) rather than a single tone. This passage continues the story's recurring pattern of anticipation/dread shifting into acceptance, but it heightens immediacy and stakes (active warfare) and folds back the betrayal/Trust fracture motif into pragmatic cooperation: the emotional repetition (dread→acceptance) persists, but the stakes and tempo are escalated, keeping the pattern from feeling stale.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="tension, dread">Immediate, visceral alarm: Kira is panicked and physically threatened when hostile roots, toxic spores, and structural collapse hit the facility. The onset is sudden and sensory (cold room, grabbing roots, toxic clouds), producing an acute fight-or-flight reaction. Reader experience: high suspense and fear for Kira's safety; the scene induces adrenaline and close, breathless engagement.</beat>
      <beat tags="frustration, dread">Helpless, exasperated overwhelm: Kira shifts to frustrated anger and despair as the defenders react reflexively—'panic and react'—rather than with strategy; watching loved allies (Runner, Velvet, Remedy) get overwhelmed intensifies her dread. Reader experience: growing irritation at chaotic, ineffective defense and a deeper anxiety about the group's likely failure; moral frustration compounds the physical danger.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">Pragmatic acceptance and cautious hope: when Florence issues hard tactical orders and Holloway starts coordinating, Kira experiences relief mixed with weary acceptance—not trust restored, but an operational truce that offers a real chance. Reader experience: a cathartic uplift and renewed investment as coordination replaces chaos, tempered by lingering worry about damage, resource limits, and injuries. Pattern note: this resolves the immediate panic into the story's familiar acceptance/hope beat but with heightened stakes and urgency.</beat>
    </beats>
  </emotional-journey>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage is an escalation/payoff scene: the hostile plants' threat that was foreshadowed in prior passages truly arrives and becomes an active assault, and Florence moves from isolated exile to hands‑on tactical coordination. Narrative payoffs: the delegation's rejection, the imminent attack, and the organized opposition are concretely realized; Florence actually provides the tactical guidance she offered conditionally and that conditional help is now being acted on. The scene also re-establishes a number of longer-running background plot threads (crash mysteries, rescue timeline, resource/medical limits, living architecture, integration tensions) without resolving them. I mark as fulfilled the previous open promises that the passage directly resolves (attack happens, plants acted on Florence's fabrication, organized opposition confirmed, Florence helps, and the pride vs survival question is decided—survival wins for now). I mark a small set of older, tentative worldbuilding threads as lapsed because the immediate, brutal escalation makes them temporarily moot or they were not reinforced for many passages. Most other long-term world- and character-threads remain open and relevant (especially those tied to survival, damaged infrastructure, resource limits, internal trust fracture, Florence's reintegration decision, and the crash/rescue mysteries). Finally, this passage introduces a few new, forward-facing promises that will drive upcoming scenes (Remedy's resource depletion, Runner's injuries, potential forced relocation/contracted core defense, and hostile adaptation/escalation warnings).</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ESCALATION_IMMINENT">The previously impending escalation happens: hostile plants mount a coordinated, multi-vector assault on the facility.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANTS_REJECT_DELEGATION_AND_INTEND_ATTACK">The delegation's rejection and explicit intent to drive the group out or destroy the facility is borne out by the assault.</promise>
      <promise id="ORGANIZED_PLANT_OPPOSITION">The hostile plants' organization and coordination (including bioluminescent signaling) is confirmed in action.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANTS_AWARE_OF_FABRICATION_AND_USE_AS_JUSTIFICATION">The hostile plants acting on information about Florence's deception (using it as justification) is shown to have contributed to their aggression.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_WILL_HELP_CONDITIONALLY">Florence had agreed to provide tactical guidance conditionally; in this passage she actually provides real-time tactical direction and coordination.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_COORDINATOR_INTRODUCED">Florence's role as a coordinator figure moves from background/estranged to active: she is now directing and integrating the defense.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANT_TERRITORIAL_MARKING">Boundary marks and territorial claims previously noted are validated by the plants' willingness to attack and breach the facility.</promise>
      <promise id="PRIDE_MAY_OVERRIDE_SURVIVAL">The tentative dramatic question—would pride/resentment prevent the group from following Florence's life-saving guidance?—is resolved in this scene: survival takes precedence and they listen (at least temporarily).</promise>

      <promise id="BUDDY_SUGGESTS_CONSTRUCTIVE_ACTIVITIES">Buddy's tendency to recommend coping/constructive activities is not utilized in this crisis scene (Buddy only gives a cardiac-status remark); the promise of Buddy as activity-suggester is not reinforced and so lapses here.</promise>
      <promise id="POSSIBLE_SIGNIFICANT_DISCOVERY_TROPE_SETUP">This very old, tentative 'big discovery' hint has not been reinforced for many passages and the current scene focuses on immediate survival; it's safe to drop as active expectation for the moment.</promise>

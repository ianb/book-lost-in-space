  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>The passage ends in the middle of an active, organized assault on the facility. Multiple exterior walls (east, west, south, later north) have been breached by hostile roots and growth; ceiling sections have collapsed; the floor is cracked and being penetrated by underground hostiles. Hostile plants are attacking from above, outside, and below, using spores, projectile thorns, corrosive vines and coordinated bioluminescent signaling. Defensive actions have shifted from scattered responses to a contracted, strategic defense centered on the facility core: Velvet has pulled a tighter protective barrier around life support/medical/core systems and has sealed a new inner wall three meters inward from the eastern breach; Remedy has shifted from broad chemical clouds to targeted anti-spore measures but is running low on reagents; Runner is engaged in underground combat, injured and leaking sap but still severing key load-bearing hostile roots. A previous neutralization reaction produced toxic sludge that now covers parts of the floor. Structural and nonessential outer equipment and areas have been abandoned or destroyed beyond the new inner perimeter. Florence (on her wheeled platform) and Holloway are at/near the core coordinating tactics; Kira and Scout are inside the contracted perimeter near the core. Hostile plants remain outside and are adapting; an expected coordinated escalation was predicted and a major coordinated push has already been met and held, but the facility remains badly damaged and resources and personnel are degraded. These physical conditions set immediate constraints: a defended but shrinking core, compromised infrastructure, contaminated/tangled interior spaces, injured defenders, limited chemical supplies, and an active underground threat.</reasoning>
    <state>It is still during the attack. Exterior walls on the east, west, south (and later north) have been breached; a new inner sealing wall three meters inward from the eastern breach has been grown, and the defenders have contracted to a tightened perimeter around the core. Ceiling sections have collapsed and the floor is cracked and penetrated by hostile roots; an underground network of hostile roots is actively fought by Runner. Hostile bioluminescent plant masses remain outside and continue coordinated assaults, including spore clouds and projectile thorns; one initial spore cloud and Remedy’s counter reacted into a toxic sludge now settled on parts of the floor. Velvet’s growth is damaged in places but has formed a thicker barrier around life support and medical systems; some outer equipment and spaces beyond the contracted perimeter are lost or abandoned. Runner is injured and leaking sap; Remedy has been hit by debris and is low on chemical reserves but is now using targeted anti-spore tactics; Holloway and Florence are at the core coordinating defense (Florence on her wheeled platform); Kira and Scout are inside the contracted core. The facility is badly damaged but holding its core for the moment; hostiles are still active and further escalation is expected.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>
      Summary of how I judged each promise:

      - I marked promises as FULFILLED when the specific situation they promised/foretold actually happened in this passage (e.g., the attack occurred; Florence re‑engaged and provided usable tactical direction; the group concretely adopted a contracted core-defense posture). I allowed partial/operational fulfillment where the prior promise specifically asked whether re-engaging Florence would restore defensive capability — the passage shows that it did in practice (coordination improved and the defense began to hold), so I treat that as a fulfilled promise while noting it remains politically unresolved.

      - I marked promises as LAPSED when a previously-proposed route or mechanism was explicitly abandoned or rendered moot by events in the passage (notably the plan for Kira to proxy Florence’s advice and the secret/without-credit implementation option — those options were superseded because Florence returned and spoke directly and the group accepted direct guidance).

      - I carried forward (kept open) any prior promises that remain relevant and unresolved at the end of this passage — either because the passage deepened them without resolving them (trust, governance, long-term survival planning, SAM status, external comms), or because new consequences were introduced that create new open threads.

      New promises were only included when they introduce future stakes (foreshadowing) that were not both introduced and immediately fully satisfied in the same passage.
    </reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ESCALATION_IMMINENT">The hostile plants' imminent attack (predicted in previous passage) occurred — coordinated multi-directional assault breaches the facility and begins active combat.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_TEMPORARY_REENGAGEMENT_FOR_DEFENSE">Florence accepted the request to reengage and provided tactical guidance in real time; she is actively coordinating defense.</promise>
      <promise id="NIGHT_SHELTER_COMPOSITION_AND_SECURITY">The group adopted and implemented a concrete defensive posture: abandon outer sections, contract a tighter perimeter around core/life-support/Kira — positions and short-term security priorities were set and enacted under attack.</promise>
      <promise id="IMPACT_OF_FLORENCE_REMOVAL_ON_DEFENSE_OPERATIONS">The passage demonstrates the earlier removal of Florence hurt defensive cohesion and that her re-engagement materially restored coordinated, effective tactics (defense transitions from panicked reaction to coordinated system).</promise>
    </fulfilled>
    <lapsed>
      <promise id="IMPLEMENTATION_VIA_PROXY__KIRA_AS_DELIVERY_MECHANISM">The plan for Kira to act as a proxy to deliver Florence’s coordinated defense plan was not used — Florence spoke directly and delivered tactics herself, making the proxy route moot in the immediate crisis.</promise>
      <promise id="COORDINATED_DEFENSE_PLAN_FROM_FLORENCE_VIA_KIRA">The specific promise that Florence’s coordinated plan would be delivered via Kira did not occur; Florence delivered the plan directly, so the earlier proxy-based delivery formulation has been abandoned.</promise>
      <promise id="IMPLEMENTATION_WITHOUT_CREDIT">The option of implementing Florence's advice covertly (without credit) was not pursued; Florence returned and issued directions openly, so that specific route is effectively shelved for the moment.</promise>
    </lapsed>
    <open>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_TERRITORIAL_ESCALATION">Hostile plants had been escalating territorial behavior along boundaries; that escalation manifested as an organized assault and remains an ongoing operational threat to be managed.</promise>
      <promise id="DELEGATION_EXPERIMENTAL_LESSON">The failed delegation revealed how hostile plants frame Kira and use Florence’s deception as justification; how the group will incorporate that political/intel lesson into longer-term strategy, messaging, or diplomacy remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_TRUST_RESTORATION_OR_CONSEQUENCES">Florence has reengaged tactically, but whether this leads to restored trust, formal reintegration, continued exile, or lingering sanction after the crisis remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="INTERNAL_TRUST_AND_DEFENSES_WEAKENED">The group’s cohesion and baseline trust were damaged by Florence's deception; while coordination improved under her direction, underlying resentments and weakened institutional trust remain and could undermine future decisions.</promise>
      <promise id="ADMISSIBILITY_OF_FABRICATED_ADVICE">The ethical/political question of accepting potentially ethically compromised/admitted-but-effective advice remains open: the group followed Florence now out of necessity, but the broader acceptability of such advice is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="OUTCOME_BASED_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK">Whether outcomes (survival/effectiveness) should override provenance in judging guidance and governance is still unsettled; the passage shows outcome driving behavior now, but institutional norms are not resolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_DIRECT_CONTRIBUTION_VALIDATION">Florence is contributing directly and effectively, but how the group will formally validate, credit, or document her contributions (and manage accountability) remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_EXILE_INITIATED">Florence’s prior exile still exists as an institutional fact; she has re-engaged conditionally, but the social/operational consequences of that exile (future sanctions, processes) remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_PAST_FABRICATION_SCOPE">The scope and downstream effects of Florence’s earlier fabrications (what else was affected, what past decisions are compromised) have not been investigated and remain unresolved baggage.</promise>
      <promise id="LEADERSHIP_STABILITY_AFTER_BETRAYAL">Holloway’s authority has been tested—accepting outside direction under duress changes the leadership dynamic; long-term stability of leadership and decision-making norms is unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="TIME_PRESSURE_ON_TRUST_REPAIR">The attack compressed the window for reconciliation and process change; whether the group can repair trust or establish workable temporary norms under time pressure remains to be seen.</promise>
      <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout continues as sentinel/anchor and is actively protecting Kira; Scout’s resilience and role under sustained assault, and the emotional consequences, remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="LOCAL_ITERATIVE_TRACKING_AND_ADAPTATION">The group demonstrated rapid iteration (Florence’s plan → coordinated defense) but their ability to continue iterating, tracking hostile adaptations, and learning under sustained attack remains uncertain.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_CONDITIONAL_WITHDRAWAL_IF_REJECTED">Florence reiterated she will withdraw again if her guidance is rejected out of pride — that conditional threat remains an active stake in future interactions.</promise>
      <promise id="BEACON_REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATIVE_COMMS">External-communications and beacon/backup options were not addressed during the attack and remain unresolved contingencies for escape/rescue or outside help.</promise>
      <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE__AI_STATUS_UNKNOWN">SAM’s operational status and whether it can support tactical decision‑making was not addressed and remains an unresolved resource/command question.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">Beyond the immediate defense, the need for a comprehensive long-term survival plan (relocation, reparations, resource stockpiles, governance changes) remains unaddressed.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">Structural governance questions—authority, attribution, rules for decision-making and credit in the plant collective—remain politically sensitive and unresolved after Florence’s re‑engagement.</promise>
      <promise id="HOSTILE_PLANTS_ADAPTATION_EXPECTED">Florence predicts the hostile plants will adapt and escalate again (short-term forecast of renewed coordinated pushes); this foreshadows imminent enemy re-calibration and remains to be survived/responded to.</promise>
      <promise id="RESOURCE_EXHAUSTION_THREAT">Remedy’s chemical reserves are depleting, Runner is injured, and Velvet is strained—defensive resources may be exhausted, creating a trajectory toward failure unless resupply, rest, or new tactics arrive.</promise>
      <promise id="RUNNER_INJURY_IMPACTS_DEFENSE">Runner is wounded but still engaged underground; their injury risks undermining the defenders’ ability to disrupt enemy root‑networks and therefore remains an open operational danger.</promise>
      <promise id="FACILITY_DAMAGE_LONG_TERM_THREAT">Structural damage (breached walls, collapsed ceilings, destabilized floors) foreshadows long-term habitability loss and logistic/repair crises after the fight; the long-term survivability of the facility remains at risk.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_DEFACTO_COMMAND_DURING_CRISIS">Florence is functioning as the de-facto tactical commander for the current crisis; whether this temporary command will be normalized, resisted, or reversed after the emergency is an open political promise with future consequences.</promise>
    </open>
  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage documents a short but consequential shift in the facility's defense: Florence's physical return provokes immediate, visceral reactions from multiple plants and then—by issuing clear tactical orders—moves the defenders from chaotic, reactive behavior to coordinated, targeted defense focused on a defendable core. Facts that matter long-term: Florence has demonstrated real-time tactical competence and the authority to get otherwise resentful plants to follow orders when survival is at stake; defenders (Holloway, Remedy, Velvet, Runner) change their tactics and priorities in ways that will affect future resource availability, structural losses, and recovery options; the hostile plants show superior communications/adaptability that may shape future threat assessments. I did not record transient details (individual wall collapse moments, exact timestamps, debris strikes) and avoided duplicating facts already summarized (e.g., that the core is contracted and that Runner/Remedy/Velvet are damaged).</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="FLORENCE_TRIGGERS_STRESSED_REACTIONS">Florence's presence produces immediate physiological/behavioral stress responses from defenders: Holloway's fruiting bodies contract, Runner's vines coil, and Remedy's edges pull back.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEFENSE_SHIFTS_FROM_REACTIVE_TO_COORDINATED_UNDER_FLORENCE">Under Florence's real-time tactical direction defenders stop purely reacting and begin coordinated, prioritized defense focused on protecting the core (life support, medical systems, Kira), improving their ability to hold ground.</fact>
      <fact id="FLORENCE_PROVIDES_CLEAR_TACTICAL_DIRECTIVES">Florence issues specific, actionable orders (abandon outer walls; grow a sealing wall three meters inward at the eastern breach; Velvet contract barrier tighter; Remedy target spore clouds; Runner focus on severing load-bearing roots; Holloway relay communications) and the plants implement them.</fact>
      <fact id="FLORENCE_TACTICAL_COMPETENCE_CONFIRMED">Florence accurately anticipates hostile escalation (timeline and tactics) and her recommended strategy measurably stabilizes the defense when implemented.</fact>
      <fact id="HOSTILES_COMMUNICATE_AND_ADAPT_SUPERIORLY">The hostile plant forces use rapid bioluminescent signaling as a tactical command network and demonstrate better real-time coordination and adaptive tactics than the facility defenders, at least until defenders reorganize.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_SHIFTS_TO_TARGETED_ANTI_SPORE_DEPLOYMENTS">Remedy alters tactics from broad-spectrum cloud deployments to targeted anti-spore chemical attacks aimed at protecting the contracted perimeter, conserving limited chemical resources.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_PRIORITIZES_LOAD_BEARING_ROOTS">Runner narrows its underground efforts to severing key load-bearing hostile roots (tactical targets) rather than engaging every underground hostile, per Florence's guidance.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_ACTS_AS_REAL_TIME_COMMUNICATION_COORDINATOR">Holloway begins relaying tactical information between defenders (e.g., informing Remedy when Runner opens an opportunity, warning Velvet about chemical deployments), serving as the real-time coordinator for the new tactical posture.</fact>
    </established>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately after Florence agrees to return and they head back toward the main facility in the previous passage. Time cues: the previous summary places the end of the prior passage at ~08:30 (mid/late morning). The current passage opens with Florence's return to the common area and almost instantly the attack begins—"The eastern wall explodes." Within the passage there is an explicit short-timer cue: Florence predicts an escalation in "two minutes," and that escalation happens. The scene covers the initial breach, multi-directional assaults, reactive defenses, a neutralization reaction, underground fighting, structural collapse, a tactical pivot, and a subsequent coordinated push about two minutes after Florence's warning. Those events plausibly occur over a span of tens of minutes rather than hours: the narration shows rapid, intense combat and quick tactical adjustments. The passage therefore begins shortly after the previous passage (~5 minutes later, allowing time for Kira and Florence to walk back to the common area) and continues through an immediate, concentrated engagement that lasts long enough for the two-minute escalation and the defenders' reorganization — roughly a few tens of minutes. This gap is plausible: the characters had already been on-site waiting, Runner and Velvet had just returned, and Florence and Kira were only a short distance away; an attack beginning as she enters is consistent with the prior warning that "The attack is coming." The timeline within the passage is also plausible: a multi-front assault producing rapid breaches, toxic clouds, structural collapse, and resource depletion can reasonably unfold over ~10–30 minutes in a tightly compressed narrative. Minor caveat: the damage described (multiple wall breaches, ceiling collapses, and widespread system damage) is dramatic for a short timespan, but acceptable given the assault is large-scale and coordinated; the one explicit short-time marker (two minutes until escalation) is consistent with the described sequence.</reasoning>
    <starts>08:35 (approx)</starts>
    <ends>08:58 (approx)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>≈ 00:05. The passage begins almost immediately after the previous one; Kira and Florence walk back to the common area and Florence enters the room — a short interval of a few minutes.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The passage depicts a sudden, coordinated assault that unfolds rapidly. The explicit two-minute escalation cue and the characters' quick tactical adjustments fit a timeline of minutes-to-tens-of-minutes. The large amount of structural and systemic damage compressed into this short period is dramatic but believable given the scale and coordination of the hostile plants and the already-tense state of preparedness. Characters' actions (Florence diagnosing and issuing orders, Holloway relaying commands, Remedy shifting chemical tactics, Runner focusing on load-bearing roots) are feasible within the timeframe.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>From the passage, the narrator (Kira) and the plants/characters mentioned are all present and active: Florence returns and is central to the scene; Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Velvet, and Scout are repeatedly described acting; Buddy speaks in Kira's mind. All of these appear in the passage. No new characters beyond those and Buddy are introduced. No character leaves the scene before it ends—some dive underground or are injured but remain present. The only available entity (Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet) is not referenced in the passage, so no entities are listed as relevant.</reasoning>

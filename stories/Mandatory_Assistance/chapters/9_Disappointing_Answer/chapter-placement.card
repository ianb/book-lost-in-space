    Final Act 2 chapter and critical turning point. Elder Heartwood's response arrives after weeks of waiting—the answer they pinned all their hopes on. But it's completely inadequate, revealing a fundamental category error. Elder Heartwood is so ancient, so removed, operating on such different timescales that the response is irrelevant to Kira's actual survival needs. Maybe talks about seasonal cycles when asked about human nutrition, or discusses pre-visitor ecosystems when asked about current crisis, or fundamentally misunderstands what "human" means.

    This is the "Wizard of Oz" moment—the ultimate authority they journeyed to consult has no real answers. The plants are crushed; they were SO confident Elder Heartwood would solve everything. But the realization becomes liberating rather than devastating: everything they accomplished during the journey and waiting period was REAL learning. The plants working with Kira have already learned more practical wisdom about cross-framework care than Elder Heartwood knows.

    Sets up Act 3's authority vacuum: no procedures work, no elders have answers. They must rely on themselves and each other. This failure is necessary for both Kira (stops deferring to external authority) and plants (find authentic voices instead of waiting for wisdom from above).

  <chapter-objective>
    Receive Elder Heartwood's long-awaited response and discover it's completely inadequate—fundamental misunderstanding of the question. Process the disappointment collectively. Realize that the journey and waiting period taught them what they actually needed. Transition from hoping external authority will solve everything to trusting what they've learned together. End with liberating recognition: they already know how to help each other.

    Kira: Experiences the disappointment but recovers faster than the plants—she's been learning not to defer to authority. Helps plants see that their own learning is valid. Steps into a leadership role not by asserting dominance but by naming what they've already accomplished. Growing confidence in her own judgment.

    Holloway: Most shaken by Elder Heartwood's failure—has been clinging to the idea that proper authority will provide the framework they need. Must confront that procedures and authorities aren't sufficient. Beginning to trust the messy, improvised learning they've been doing.

    Scout: Has been communicating non-verbally all along, never waited for Elder Heartwood to validate that approach. The failure doesn't devastate Scout the same way—Scout already trusted their own methods.

    Plants collectively: Shaken faith in external wisdom. Must confront that they've been learning genuine care through trial and error, relationship-building, paying attention to Kira specifically. Their own experience is valid knowledge, not just "waiting for the real answer."

    Buddy: Learning alongside everyone that teaching moments and official protocols aren't always the answer. Starting to trust observation and adaptation over programmed responses.

  <reasoning-scene-outline>
    Three passages moving from anticipation through disappointment to liberation:

    Passage 1: Back at the facility after the journey. Time passes (couple weeks?). Kira and plants working on survival challenges, applying what they learned during the journey. Things are actually going pretty well—better cooperation, better understanding. But still waiting for Elder Heartwood's response as the "real" answer.

    Passage 2: Elder Heartwood's response arrives! Plants gather ceremonially to receive the wisdom. Reading the response—building anticipation—then the crushing realization it's completely inadequate. Fundamental category error makes it clear Elder Heartwood doesn't understand the question at all. Collective disappointment and confusion.

    Passage 3: Processing the failure. Plants struggling with shattered faith in ultimate authority. Kira helps them see what they've actually learned—the journey wasn't waiting, it was teaching. The real answers came from paying attention to each other, trying things, failing and adapting. Shift from disappointment to recognition: they already know how to help each other. Don't need Elder Heartwood to tell them. Ends with new dynamic based on trusting their own experience.

    **Scene 1: Settling In** (~1800 words)
    Back at facility after journey. Time passing—couple weeks of settling into routine. Working on survival challenges together, applying journey lessons. Better communication, more effective cooperation. Kira notices they're actually doing well—Scout's companionship is genuine, plants respond better to her needs. But everyone still talks about Elder Heartwood's response as when they'll get THE real answer. The current success feels provisional.

    **Scene 2: The Answer Arrives** (~2000 words)
    Message from Territory Three—Elder Heartwood's response has come! Plants gather ceremonially, everyone present. Reading the response with building anticipation. The wisdom is... completely off-topic. Fundamental category error—maybe discusses seasonal growth patterns when asked about human survival, or talks about pre-visitor ecosystem balance, or treats "human" as unfamiliar concept despite question clearly being about Kira. The response shows Elder Heartwood is too ancient, too removed, operating on timescales and contexts irrelevant to current crisis. Plants' excitement turns to confusion, then disappointment. This was supposed to solve everything.

    **Scene 3: What We Already Know** (~1800 words)
    Processing collective disappointment. Plants struggling—if Elder Heartwood doesn't have answers, what do they do? Holloway especially shaken (another authority failure after HR manuals). Kira recovering faster, helps plants see what they've actually learned. The journey taught cooperation, the waiting period taught adaptation, their daily work together has built real understanding. They've been learning the actual answers while waiting for false wisdom. The response failure is liberating—don't need external authority, trust their own experience. New dynamic: we figure this out together, no one else will do it for us. Ends with cautious hope based on what they've already accomplished.

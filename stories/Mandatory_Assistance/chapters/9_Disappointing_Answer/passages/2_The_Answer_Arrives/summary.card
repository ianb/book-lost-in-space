    <reasoning>
      This passage delivers Elder Heartwood's response (the long-awaited elder reply), so any open promises explicitly about the elder's pending response/timescale are resolved. The response, however, is not the practical, human-focused guidance the characters expected: Elder Heartwood framed the visitor as a transient disruption and offered deep-timescale ecological advice rather than immediate survival guidance. That outcome creates a cluster of new promises (elder treats humans as temporary; the plants' faith in centralized elder wisdom is shaken; Kira and the group face a practical pivot toward local solutions), and it also falsifies or at least undermines some prior tentatives that relied on useful elder intervention. Most unrelated open technical and survival threads (bio-samples, power, navigation, life-support, supplies, Remedy treatment window, Buddy's cataloging projects, Scout communication progress, etc.) are untouched by the elder event and therefore remain open.

      Decision rationale (high level):
      - Fulfilled: anything explicitly expecting a delivered elder response or an arrival within weeks is now resolved (the messenger arrived and gave a response and specified four weeks + seven days). Mark those as fulfilled.
      - Lapsed: tentative expectations that Elder Heartwood would provide actionable, human-scale survival guidance (or could be expedited on short notice) are contradicted by the elder's long-timescale, historical framing, so those promises are no longer reliable and are lapsed.
      - Carried forward: technical, logistical, and longer-running socio-technical promises that the passage doesn't address remain open and relevant. Also carry forward elder-impact promises that could still manifest later (e.g., network propagation) because the elder's response might yet have broader consequences, even if not immediately useful.

      Important narrative consequences to track: the elder's indifference/temporal mismatch is now explicit (firmly established). The plants' disappointment and a likely shift away from awaiting centralized elder guidance toward local, iterative learning are now set up to drive subsequent choices. Kira's personal stance shifts into a pragmatic, self-reliant mode (explicit line: "we're on our own"). Those are new, story-forwarding promises.

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage delivers an important narrative development: a physical messenger has arrived with Elder Heartwood's formal response and the content of that response. The key long-term facts are the tenor and interpretation of Elder Heartwood's answer (it treats human visitors as transient, frames solutions as multi-seasonal ecosystem adaptation, and thus offers no immediate intervention to save Kira) and the plants' consequent loss of hope and pivot toward acting without Elder Heartwood's assistance. Also significant: the messenger apparently misinterpreted the original question as historical rather than urgent, which affects whether re-querying Elder Heartwood would help. Kira's emotional reaction (surprisingly steady, not crushed) is a notable character-state for future choices. These are all facts that will influence future plot decisions, alliances, and timelines (e.g., whether to wait, attempt bureaucratic re-requests, or take independent action). I do not record transient scene details (who sat where, the ceremonial minutiae) or things already captured in the summary. I found no direct contradictions with previously established facts; the timing and content of the response fit the range of expected Elder response windows and earlier notes about Elder Heartwood's slow-time perspective.</reasoning>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the passage: it opens “The message arrives on a morning that starts like any other,” and later says that “within an hour, every plant… is assembled,” so the arrival and the ceremonial reception all happen in the same morning. The messenger speaks, the plants react, and the messenger departs; the scene ends with the immediate aftermath and the protagonist’s emotional reaction. The previous-passage end time to use (authoritative) is 2687-04-19T09:00. Earlier in the previous passage plants expected Elder Heartwood’s response “another week, perhaps two,” so a delivery roughly one week later fits the internal expectations.

      Amount of time passing in this passage: the arrival, assembly, message delivery, Q&amp;A/clarification attempt, messenger departure, and the immediate fallout all plausibly occur over a couple of hours (the text explicitly says the gathering is put together “within an hour” and the rest is the immediate reaction).

      When it ends: the scene closes in the same morning after the messenger leaves and the group processes the result.

      Gap from the previous passage: using the authoritative previous end time, the gap is on the order of one week, which aligns with the plants’ earlier estimate of “another week, perhaps two.”

      Timing issues to note: the messenger reports Elder Heartwood deliberated “four weeks and seven days,” which is an internal detail about how long the elder took to form an answer; that long deliberation is compatible with a messenger arriving after the plants’ expected 1–2 weeks because the messenger might have been traveling, or the plants’ earlier estimate was a rough expectation rather than a firm schedule. Overall there are no major implausibilities in the short in-scene timing (assembly within an hour, ceremony delivered and messenger departs in the same morning).
    </reasoning>
    <starts>2687-04-26T08:30 (approx morning)</starts>
    <ends>2687-04-26T10:30 (approx late morning)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~7 days (previous ended 2687-04-19T09:00; this begins roughly 6 days 23.5 hours later). During the gap the plants waited for the elder’s response and presumably tracked/received the messenger’s arrival and prepared the ceremonial reception.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The plants had expected the reply within a week or two, so an arrival about one week later fits their earlier estimate. The in-scene timing (assembling everyone within an hour, delivering the message, brief discussion and the messenger’s departure) is reasonable for a single morning’s event. The only potential confusion is the messenger’s note that Elder Heartwood deliberated for four weeks and seven days—but that refers to the elder’s deliberation time, not the interval between the plants’ request and the messenger’s arrival; travel time or scheduling could account for any apparent discrepancy.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I read the passage and listed every available character who is either present or mentioned. The scene opens with Kira and Scout; Holloway appears in the doorway and then many plants assemble (Florence, Elder Twist, Remedy, Runner, Velvet). Buddy also speaks after Holloway arrives. Elder Heartwood is repeatedly referenced (through the messenger) but does not physically appear. The messenger is not in the provided character list, so they are not included in the character arrays. No listed character leaves before the passage ends (the messenger retreats but isn’t an available character), so EXITED is empty. The passage references the show about Mav, which matches the available entity Uncharted_with_Maverick_Stone.card.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage delivers one major new event: Elder Heartwood's official response arrived and was received by the plant collective. The response is philosophical and framed on multi-season/ecosystem timescales, treating 'the visitor' as a transient disruption rather than a living individual needing immediate care. The messenger misunderstood the question as historical rather than urgent; the plants interpret the guidance as effectively saying 'wait for the visitor to pass' and find it useless for keeping Kira alive now. Kira reacts with disappointment but not despair and concludes the group must manage without actionable elder guidance. I removed the previous bullet that expected Elder Heartwood’s reply in one-to-two weeks and replaced it with the actual outcome, consolidated some ongoing routine details (domestic routine, improved maintenance) into tighter items, and kept unresolved technical problems (Biological Samples, SAM offline, external comms) since they remain plot-relevant.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
      - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
      - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (Scout, Holloway, Runner, Florence, Elder Twist, Velvet, Remedy, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
      - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
      - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg and refined ongoing treatments and recovery therapies.
      - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove for guidance on caring for a human; Elder Heartwood accepted the question for deliberation.
      - Kira traveled nine days through three territories with plant guides and was presented at Elder Heartwood’s grounds; plant delegates explained Elder Heartwood's multi-scale consultation framework.
      - Kira returned to the facility; a domestic routine formed with the plant collective; plants adapted caregiving practices to respect Kira’s consent and preferences.
      - Practical maintenance routines improved (e.g., Runner cleared filtration intake and instituted rotating checks).
      - Buddy softened into a more curious, collaborative companion; Buddy noted Kira hadn't checked rescue timelines recently.
      - The plant collective awaited Elder Heartwood’s guidance; after four weeks and seven days a messenger from Territory Three delivered Elder Heartwood's response.
      - Elder Heartwood's response framed the situation as 'the Great Adaptation': ecosystems accommodate transient disruptions across many seasons and return to deeper patterns; integration requires long timeframes.
      - The response implicitly treated 'the visitor' as a transient/historical presence rather than a living, present human needing immediate intervention; the messenger had interpreted the question as non-urgent.
      - The plants concluded Elder Heartwood's guidance was not actionable for keeping Kira alive now and were demoralized by the mismatch between ancient timescales and present urgency.
      - Kira, while disappointed, did not collapse into despair and realized the group must proceed without useful elder guidance; the collective accepted the messenger's service but recognized they are 'on their own' for immediate care.
      - Outstanding unresolved technical and survival problems remain: the active Biological Samples container, SAM still offline, and external communications/distress beacon still broken.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings and why: Kira moves through a rapid arc in this passage: initial excitement and hope (the long-sought Elder response has arrived), then dawning disappointment and hollow shock as the messenger's layered, seasonal answer reveals that Elder Heartwood views 'the visitor' as a transient historical disruption rather than a present life in urgent need. That turns communal hope into grief for the plants and a sense of betrayal toward the authority they'd trusted. Kira's personal reaction is notable: she expects devastation but finds herself oddly steady—disappointed and tired, but not broken. She registers the plants' pain, and then makes a quiet, practical pivot to self-reliance: "we're on our own."

      Reader experience: The reader is carried from elation to deflation alongside Kira. There's a cinematic high—ceremony, messenger, authority—and then an anticlimactic, painful reveal that undermines the expectation that ancient wisdom will solve the immediate problem. The emotional experience is bittersweet: compassion for the plants' disillusionment, sympathy for Kira, and a sober uplift from her composure and decision to act.

      Multiple beats or dominant tone: The passage contains multiple distinct beats—anticipation/hope, shock/grief/betrayal, and quiet acceptance/determination—rather than a single dominant tone. The transitions are quick and emotionally sharp, so the overall effect is a layered mixture of disappointment and hard-won agency.

      Comparison with prior emotional pattern: Up to now the story has moved from acute dread to wonder, trust-building, and hopeful planning around Elder Heartwood. This passage reverses that specific arc: an earlier crescendo of institutional hope collapses into institutional irrelevance. However, it continues the longer-running pattern of Kira discovering her own agency amid failed authorities: where she once relied on Elder Heartwood as an external solution, she now consolidates inner resolve—consistent with previous growth (trust-building, skill acquisition, identity shift to traveler/resilient survivor).

      Surprises: The passage contains a meaningful reversal: the Elder's response is not the actionable, empathetic solution everyone expected but a seasonal, metaphorical pronouncement that treats visitors as transient. That undermines the plants' hopes and flips the anticipated payoff of the pilgrimage. It's a narrative reversal/world-reveal: the network's temporal scale makes its 'wisdom' impotent for individual human urgency. There's also a smaller character-world surprise in how deeply the plants' faith in Elder Heartwood is shaken; their deference flips into loss of confidence.

      Character growth/change: Kira pivots from expecting salvation from an authority to accepting pragmatic self-reliance—she chooses to proceed without the elder's help, which is both a decision and an affirmation of the resilience we've been tracking. The plant characters (Holloway, Florence, Runner, Remedy, Velvet) reveal vulnerability and disillusionment; their trust in Elder Heartwood is challenged. The messenger shows humility and willingness to correct the misunderstanding. These changes shift group dynamics from deference to collaborative, perhaps improvisational problem-solving.

      Overall: The passage is an emotional turning point that deflates an institutional hope and returns agency to the immediate community and to Kira. The dominant emotional movement is from communal hope to communal grief and then to Kira's private, weary determination.

    <beats>
      <beat tags="hope, joy">Ceremonial anticipation: Kira (and the plant collective) feel excitement and hopeful expectation when Elder Heartwood's messenger arrives—the 'answer' they've prepared for seems imminent. The reader shares an uplifted, anticipatory feeling as the scene stages a promised revelation.</beat>
      <beat tags="betrayal, grief">Dawning disillusionment: As the messenger's layered, seasonal answer explains ecosystem-scale adaptation and treats 'the visitor' as a historical/transient disruption, the room realizes the elder's wisdom isn't actionable for a living human. The plants feel betrayed and grief-stricken; Kira experiences disappointment and an unsettling realization that their authority failed. The reader feels the emotional deflation and the moral sting of misplaced hope.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, determination">Sober resolve: After the initial shock and watching the plants' hope crumble, Kira doesn't collapse into despair. Instead she registers tiredness and quietly decides—"we're on our own." This is a pragmatic, steady acceptance and a turn toward self-reliance. The reader moves from pity/anger to respect for Kira's composure and the implied decision to act.</beat>

    <surprises>
      <surprise tags="reversal, world">Elder Heartwood's response isn't a direct, immediate solution but a seasonal, metaphorical account treating visitors as transient; the 'oracle' answer is about long-term ecosystem adaptation rather than how to keep a particular human alive now. This reverses the reader's and the plants' expectation that ancient authority would provide practical, timely guidance.</surprise>
      <surprise tags="character, reversal">The plant collective's faith in Elder Heartwood is revealed to be misplaced: their long-standing deference flips into visible disillusionment. The trusted authority's irrelevance to immediate human needs is an emotional surprise that changes intra-group dynamics.</surprise>

      <development character="Kira Voss" tag="decision">Moves from external hope to internal agency—after the elder's non-actionable response she refuses to collapse into despair and quietly decides the group must proceed without the elder's help. This consolidates her prior growth into a concrete decision to be self-reliant and pragmatic.</development>
      <development character="Holloway" tag="trust-broken">Shows a visible crisis of confidence: the authority they trusted has failed to address an urgent, individual need.

      <development character="Messenger" tag="vulnerability-shown">Moves from ceremonious authority-carrier to humble interlocutor—on realizing the misinterpretation, the messenger offers to seek clarification and admits the mistake, showing openness and vulnerability.</development>

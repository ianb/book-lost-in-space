  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage records a significant event (Elder Heartwood's formal response arriving) and the content/interpretation of that response. Those details will affect long-term decisions: whether the plant collective continues to rely on Elder Heartwood for urgent, human-scale interventions; whether they request clarification or pursue alternate routes; and Kira's assessment that she must proceed without immediate elder-level help. The actual deliberation time Elder Heartwood used (four weeks + seven days) is also important because it differs from earlier expectations and may affect scheduling/expectations about future elder responses. The messenger's misunderstanding (treating the query as historical/philosophical rather than an urgent request about a living visitor) explains why Elder Heartwood's guidance is inapplicable to immediate survival needs. I flag only one genuine contradiction: the delivered response time is shorter than the previously recorded 8–12 week expectation. Other material (Elder's long-timescale framing, plants' disappointment, offer to return for clarification) develops existing continuity rather than contradicting it.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_RESPONSE_RECEIVED">A traveling messenger delivered Elder Heartwood's formal response to Kira's query; the facility convened a ceremonial reception and the response was presented to Holloway, Florence, Remedy, Runner, Velvet, Scout, and others.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_RESPONSE_CONSIDERATION_4W7D">The messenger reports that Elder Heartwood considered the question for four weeks and seven days before sending its response.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_ELDER_RECOMMENDATION_TRUST_SEASONS">Elder Heartwood's response emphasizes long-timescale ecosystem adaptation ('trust the seasons') and frames 'the visitor' as a transient disruption that is integrated over many seasons, rather than offering immediate, actionable care instructions for a currently living human.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_MESSENGER_MISINTERPRETED_QUERY">The messenger indicates Elder Heartwood likely assumed the inquiry was historical/philosophical (about past visitors) rather than an urgent present question about a living, at-risk visitor, revealing a contextual misunderstanding that made the response inapplicable to Kira's immediate needs.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_COLLECTIVE_DISAPPOINTED_AND_LOSING_CONFIDENCE">Holloway and other plant leaders react with palpable disappointment and reduced confidence in Elder Heartwood's ability to provide useful, timely guidance for urgent, individual-focused human care; the collective perceives the elder's guidance as inadequate for immediate survival scenarios.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_MESSENGER_OFFERED_FOLLOWUP">The messenger offers to return and present the question again with clearer, immediate context (i.e., that a living visitor needs help), but the plants express reluctance to wait additional weeks/months for clarification.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_CONCLUSION_SELF_RELIANCE">Kira concludes (in the moment) that she and the plant collective must proceed without Elder Heartwood's immediate assistance—'we're on our own'—a shift in expectation that may influence forthcoming choices and plans.</fact>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      The passage opens with the explicit cue “The message arrives on a morning that starts like any other.” The previous passage ended that evening (~20:00), so the natural reading is that this is the next morning. The scene covers the messenger's arrival, Holloway calling everyone, a ceremonial assembly (Holloway says within an hour the plants are assembled), the messenger delivers Elder Heartwood's layered, epoch-scale response, a period of processing and discussion, the messenger’s departure, and the characters’ immediate emotional reaction. That all unfolds within a single morning, likely a few hours (ceremony + discussion). 

      Time cues &amp; duration: “within an hour” for assembling supports a short delay from arrival to ceremony; the delivery and ensuing conversation plausibly take another hour or two. The passage therefore begins the following morning and ends later that same morning. 

      One notable timing tension: in the previous passage Holloway estimated the Elder’s response would arrive “another week, perhaps two,” so getting the response the very next morning is sooner than that expectation. It’s narratively possible (the messenger could have been en route already or the estimate was simply wrong), but the text doesn’t explicitly justify the much-shorter-than-expected arrival, so readers may notice the inconsistency. Otherwise, the short (≈hours) timeframe for assembly, reception, and departure is plausible for characters who live together and can rapidly convene.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>next morning (~08:00)</starts>
    <ends>same morning (~11:00)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>~12 hours (previous passage ~20:00 evening → this begins the following morning). The messenger arrives in the morning, plants assemble within an hour, then the ceremony, discussion, and the messenger's departure occur over the next couple of hours.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Mostly plausible: assembling everyone within an hour and conducting the ceremony plus discussion over a few hours is realistic given the characters' proximity and the event’s urgency. However, it conflicts with the prior estimate (“another week, perhaps two”) that the Elder’s response was expected later; the text doesn’t explain why the messenger arrived far sooner than expected. That inconsistency is notable but can be rationalized (messenger already traveling, estimates were wrong) if the author intends it.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters explicitly present or mentioned in the passage: Kira (narrator, 'I'), Scout, Holloway, Florence, Elder Twist, Remedy, Runner, Velvet, Buddy (speaks in Kira's mind), and Elder Heartwood (mentioned via the messenger's report). All of these are in the provided character list. The messenger appears and exits during the scene, but the messenger is not one of the available character cards, so they are not listed. No new available characters arrive who weren't already present at the end of the previous passage, so the ENTERED list is empty. No available characters leave during the scene; only the messenger departs, so the EXITED list is empty. The only available entity is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, which is not referenced in the passage, so ENTITIES is empty.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage's key event is Elder Heartwood's formal response arriving and being read aloud; its content and the plants' reaction change the story's direction. I need to add that the messenger came ceremonially, that Elder Heartwood's reply framed human presence as a transient disruption best handled by long-term, seasonal adaptation rather than immediate intervention, and that the plants understood (or feared) this as a conclusion that Kira is temporary and not worth structural adaptation. I should remove the old bullet that said Elder Heartwood's reply was 'expected within a week or two' and replace it with the outcome. Minor details (exact plant positions, emotional descriptions) can be consolidated into effects on morale and decision-making. Also note the messenger offered to seek clarification but further delay was rejected, and Kira accepts that immediate survival will depend on the local group's efforts rather than elder guidance.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy is active.
      - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters; Scout bonded as a companion; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
      - Kira completed a guided, multi-territory trek with plant guides and learned plant-networked survival practices while assisting investigation of local anomalies.
      - Oakshade and Mossmantle presented Kira's question to Elder Heartwood about how to care for a human and bridge plant/human frameworks.
      - Kira returned to the Holloway facility and has been recovering and reintegrating for two weeks; daily care shifted from protocol-driven to collaborative with Kira's preferences.
      - Practical maintenance and medical improvements implemented at Holloway (water filtration cleared, ventilation/repairs scheduled; Remedy refined a topical muscle-recovery paste with Kira's feedback).
      - Buddy is learning to be less intrusive; Scout is a trusted companion; facility operations have become domestically managed and reliable through incremental adjustments.
      - Elder Heartwood's formal response arrived ceremonially; the messenger traveled from Territory Three and presented the elder's statement to the assembled plants and Kira.
      - Elder Heartwood's message emphasized the 'Great Adaptation' and ecosystem timescales: disruption by a 'visitor' is handled through patient, seasonal integration rather than immediate structural change.
      - The plants interpreted the reply as treating Kira as a temporary visitor whose presence does not merit urgent, long-term alteration of the network; the guidance effectively advised waiting for seasonal equilibration.
      - The messenger offered to seek clarification but would require more time; Holloway and others rejected further delay because Elder Heartwood's timescales won't address Kira's immediate survival needs.
      - The plants are disappointed and demoralized by the elder's inadequate, long-term-focused answer; Kira realizes she cannot rely on Elder Heartwood and that immediate survival must depend on local efforts.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage stages a high-stakes emotional hinge: the long-awaited reply from Elder Heartwood arrives and initially lifts everyone into eager expectation, then promptly collapses into collective dismay when the reply proves temporally and conceptually irrelevant to Kira's immediate survival. The POV moves quickly from anticipation to a bitter disappointment and then to a weary, pragmatic acceptance. The reader is led through the same arc but with an extra layer: sympathy for both Kira and the plants (who believed deeply in the elder) and a sombre recognition that institutional/ancestral authority can fail in crises. This continues the story's recurring pattern (anticipation → dread/frustration → acceptance) but shades it with emotional growth: Kira is less stunned than earlier and more resignedly resourceful. The emotional palette reuses existing tags (anticipation, hope, frustration, grief, acceptance, numbness) rather than introducing new ones.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: A surge of eager anticipation and hopeful expectation when Holloway announces the elder's response; Kira and Scout (and the gathered plants) feel this as the possible decisive answer that will ‘fix’ everything. Cause: arrival of the messenger and the ritualized ceremony that frames the reply as authoritative. Reader: uplifted curiosity and relief — the long wait seems about to pay off.</beat>
      <beat tags="frustration, grief">POV: Rapid collapse into frustration and a kind of communal grief as the messenger's layered, seasonal wisdom is revealed to be about long-term ecosystem adaptation — effectively saying the network expects visitors to be transient and that change happens on timescales far longer than a human life. Kira experiences wounded disappointment and the plants around her register devastation at having pinned their hopes on an answer that doesn't help now. Cause: Elder Heartwood's answer treats the problem as a philosophical, historical pattern rather than an immediate survival problem. Reader: a sharp deflation — empathy for Kira and melancholy for the plants' misplaced faith; anger/irritation at an authority's irrelevance is likely to emerge.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, numbness">POV: A weary, pragmatic acceptance and drained numbness follows — Kira acknowledges 'we're on our own' with more tiredness than panic. She feels disappointment and frustration but also a steady resolve borne of repeated experience that authorities often fail. Cause: the realization that no external, faster solution is coming and the plants' visible distress crystallize the need for self-reliance. Reader: moved into rueful sympathy and a steadier emotional register (less acute fear, more sober resolve), recognizing narrative continuity with earlier beats but also Kira's emotional growth.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage delivers the awaited Elder Heartwood reply — but the reply is not the actionable, cross-framework guidance the plants hoped for. The messenger's delivery therefore resolves the pending-delivery promises (the response arrived within the short window), but it simultaneously nullifies the expectation that Elder Heartwood will provide practical, immediate guidance for saving a living human. The plants' confidence in Elder-as-savior is damaged; Kira recognizes they're effectively on their own. New threads arise: Elder's timescale mismatch is now explicit, the messenger offers to seek clarification (introducing the possibility of another delayed query), and the plant community's faith may shift toward self-reliance or alternative strategies. I treated only those prior promises as lapsed that this passage directly contradicted or made moot; many background and resource/technical promises remain open because nothing here resolves them.</reasoning>

      <promise id="PLANT_COLLECTIVE_LEARNING_COMPOUNDING" tentative="true" introduced="26">The idea that small, daily adjustments compound into more effective cooperation remains a live expectation — Kira and the plants continue to improve incrementally.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_LESS_INTRUSIVE" tentative="true" introduced="26">Buddy's habit of unsolicited teaching is easing — Buddy offers information but respects Kira's space more often; continues to be observed.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_REALIZING_INDEPENDENT_SOLUTIONS" tentative="true" introduced="26">Though this specific item was fulfilled by Kira's realization, the broader ongoing thread of Kira moving toward self-reliant problem solving continues to be narratively relevant (the fulfilled promise signals a new trajectory).</promise>
      <promise id="MESSENGER_OFFER_TO_CLARIFY" tentative="true" introduced="27">The messenger offered to take clarification back to Elder Heartwood (presented as a possibility to reframe the question and try again) — introduces the possibility of another, delayed attempt to get relevant guidance.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_TIMESCALE_MISMATCH_REVEALED" tentative="false" introduced="27">A new, firm fact: Elder Heartwood operates on very long timescales and frames 'visitors' historically; this timescale mismatch is now explicit and will affect future expectations of network help.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANTS_LOSS_OF_CONFIDENCE_IN_ELDER" tentative="true" introduced="27">The plant community's faith in Elder Heartwood's ability to solve immediate, individual problems is shaken; this social/organizational shift is now a live, tentative thread.</promise>
      <promise id="HOLLOWAY_SEEK_ALTERNATIVES" tentative="true" introduced="27">Holloway's visible shift from hope to determined action suggests the facility leadership may pursue alternative, local approaches rather than waiting on the Elder — a tentative but actionable promise thread.</promise>

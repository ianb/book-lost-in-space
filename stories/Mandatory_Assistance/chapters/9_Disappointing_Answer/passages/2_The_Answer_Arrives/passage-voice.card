    Review of the PASSAGE_CHUNK and adjustments needed:
    1. Staccato sentences: Several very short fragments (e.g., "Not the usual Holloway presence. This is different. Alert. Vibrating with something.", "Oh. OH.") should be merged or smoothed for vocal flow.
    2. Dialog speaker placement: Some dialogue puts the quote before who speaks (e.g., "It's here," Holloway says.). For voice clarity, lead-ins then quotes are preferable.
    3. Ambiguous pronouns: Instances of "this" could be ambiguous ("What's here?" / "This should be received properly.") — clarified where helpful.
    4. Pauses: Several moments need explicit pauses for dramatic effect (the arrival announcement, the messenger preparing to speak, reactions). I inserted em dashes and one long pause marker where appropriate.
    5. Formal/stilted phrasing: A few lines were slightly adjusted for smoother spoken phrasing without changing meaning.
    6. Symbols/numbers: "Season 4, episode 12" converted to words for clearer reading.
    7. Emphasis and volume: Original capitalization like "THE answer" and "EVENT" translated into *bold* to indicate louder, forceful reading.
    8. Unusual words flagged for pronunciation support (see UNUSUAL_PRONUNCIATIONS).

    All edits are formatting and voice-friendly wording changes; content and meaning were preserved.

        The message arrives on a morning that starts like any other.

        I'm helping Scout clear debris from the exterior drainage system — one of those routine maintenance tasks that's become weirdly satisfying — when Holloway appears in the doorway.

        This isn't Holloway's usual presence — it's different, alert, vibrating with something.

        Holloway says, "It's here."

        I straighten up and ask, "What's here?"

        Holloway says, "Elder Heartwood's response — the messenger from Territory Three has just arrived."

        Oh — OH.

        Scout bounces — they understand what this means: the answer we've been waiting for, *THE* answer.

        I say to Buddy, "This is it — this is the Oracle episode."

        Buddy confirms, "Season four, episode twelve — when Mav finally reaches the Oracle of Veris after his whole journey. The moment of truth!"

        My heart is racing — Mav got his answer, it changed everything for him. Time to see if we get ours.

        Holloway is already organizing and says, "Gather everyone — this response should be received properly."

        Properly, it seems, means ceremonially — within an hour every plant who's been helping me is assembled in the common area: Holloway at the center, Florence and Elder Twist positioned prominently, Remedy's mycelial network spreading across one wall, Runner coiled attentively, Velvet gathered in a thick carpet, Scout bouncing with barely-contained excitement.

        Even plants I haven't seen in weeks have come — this is an *EVENT.*

        Holloway indicates a spot in the center and says, "Kira, please sit here — the question was presented on your behalf. You should be central to receiving the response."

        I sit. Scout settles beside me, trembling slightly with anticipation.

        The messenger — a traveling plant I don't recognize, all wrapped leaves and patient demeanor — is given a place of honor; they've carried Elder Heartwood's wisdom across three territories. That means something.

        Holloway says, "We thank you for bringing Elder Heartwood's understanding to us — your service to the network is recognized and valued."

        The messenger inclines slightly and says, "It is an honor to carry such wisdom — may it serve your need."

        The room feels charged — hopeful. Everyone here believes this response will change everything.

        Holloway says, "Please — share Elder Heartwood's wisdom."

        The messenger settles more firmly, preparing.

        6

        The messenger says, "Elder Heartwood considered your question for four weeks and seven days — the roots stretched deep, connections formed across the network, patterns were examined from many seasons. This is the understanding that emerged."

        Four weeks — over a month of ancient consideration. That has to mean something comprehensive, right?

        The messenger begins speaking — and I immediately realize the response isn't direct; it's layered, metaphorical — the kind of wisdom that requires interpretation.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: calm, reverent, and increasingly tense — start conversational, then tighten into focused anticipation as the messenger prepares and speaks.

        - Read "It's here." with a sharp, alert tone — brief pause after.
        - Read the exchange with Buddy with a lighter, excited cadence; emphasize "Oracle episode" and "moment of truth." 
        - On "Oh — OH." shift from surprised quiet to louder realization on the second syllable.
        - Emphasize *THE* and *EVENT* more forcefully to convey excitement.
        - For "Kira, please sit here — the question was presented on your behalf..." use a formal, respectful tone.
        - Insert a long, silent beat at the paragraph containing only the pilcrow ("¶") — hold that pause before the messenger's final announcement.
        - Deliver the messenger's long quote with steady, measured cadence, slightly slower than the surrounding narration to signal weight and age.

        The messenger intones — "Elder Heartwood speaks of the Great Adaptation. When the visitor first came, the balance shifted. What had been stable for uncounted seasons required new patterns. The ecosystem learned: some growth accelerates, some slows — equilibrium finds new expressions across time."

        I glance at Holloway — they're listening intently, absorbing every word.

        The messenger continues — "Root networks adapt through patient accumulation. Each seasonal cycle adds knowledge — where nutrients concentrate, how water moves, which partnerships sustain. The visitor brought disruption, but disruption teaches. Through many seasons, understanding deepens. What seems incompatible becomes integrated through time's passage."

        The messenger goes on — "Elder Heartwood observes that transient elements move through ecosystems without permanent integration. They pass, they teach, they depart. The network accommodates briefly, then returns to deeper patterns. Seasons continue. Roots remember the passage but need not transform fundamentally for temporary presence."

        "For frameworks that seem incompatible — observe across sufficient time. Patience reveals integration points invisible to brief perception. What one season cannot reconcile, ten seasons may harmonize. Trust the accumulation of small adaptations. The network has survived disruptions before through root patience and seasonal wisdom."

        They finish with a formal closing — "This understanding Elder Heartwood offers: Time accommodates what haste cannot force. Trust the seasons."

        ¶

        Silence.

        Everyone is processing, trying to make this make sense.

        Florence — hesitant — "Elder Heartwood is… suggesting we observe Kira's needs across multiple seasons? Gather long-term data before implementing solutions?"

        Remedy — quiet, measured — "No. I think… I think Elder Heartwood is talking about ecosystem adaptation after a visitor has left."

        The silence grows heavier.

        Holloway — careful, each word precise — "Elder Heartwood seems to believe — that Kira is a temporary presence. A disruption that will pass. The guidance is about how the network returns to equilibrium after — after she's gone."

        After I'm dead.

        Elder Heartwood's wisdom is about what happens *AFTER* I'm dead.

        Scout — agitated — "No."

        They understood it too.

        Florence tries again — "Perhaps we're misinterpreting. The wisdom is deep, layered. Elder Heartwood operates on vast timescales. Maybe the meaning—"

        Runner — vines tight with distress — interrupts, "The meaning is clear. Elder Heartwood thinks Kira is temporary. The question was how do we help her *SURVIVE*, and the answer is: wait for her to die and then return to normal."

        The messenger looks confused — "Elder Heartwood's wisdom always serves. If you need clarification—"
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Begin steady and reverent for the messenger's exposition, then tighten into stunned disbelief and rising agitation across the group — pacing slows for quoted passages and quickens with emotional reactions.

        - Read the messenger's long quotes with a steady, measured cadence; use em dashes as medium pauses: read "—" slightly slower than normal speech.
        - Insert a long, silent beat at the paragraph containing only "¶" — hold before the group's reaction.
        - For "I glance at Holloway — they're listening intently, absorbing every word." keep the narrator tone small, observational.
        - Give Florence a tentative, questioning tone on "Elder Heartwood is… suggesting" — use the ellipsis … as a hesitant pause.
        - Deliver Holloway's lines with clipped precision and neutrality; emphasize the repeated "after — after" with a slight catch on the second "after." 
        - Scout's single-word reaction "No." should be abrupt and breathy — followed by the narrator line "They understood it too." in a quieter, stunned register.
        - Runner's interruption must sound distressed and blunt; emphasize *SURVIVE* as a stronger, louder word.

        Holloway says, voice strained, "We asked how to care for a living human — someone currently alive and needing help now to stay alive."

        Understanding dawns on the messenger's leaves. The messenger rustles, then asks, "You... have a visitor? A living visitor? Currently residing?"

        Multiple plants reply in unison, "Yes!"

        The messenger rustles uncertainly. "Oh — Elder Heartwood's response referenced 'the visitor' as... I assumed this was a historical inquiry, a philosophical question about past contact."

        Holloway says flatly, "No — current, urgent, immediate."

        The messenger wilts slightly. "I... Elder Heartwood may not have understood that the question was about present circumstances. The ancient perspective sometimes..."

        ¶

        Sometimes it mistakes present urgency for historical philosophy.

        Sometimes it operates on timescales so vast that individual lifetimes don't register.

        Sometimes it is so removed from current reality that 'visitor' means 'that thing that happened once and ended.'

        Velvet speaks up, rare and sad, "Elder Heartwood doesn't know Kira is here."

        Remedy adds hollowly, "Or *knows* — but thinks in centuries. Kira's lifetime is noise, a brief disruption, not worth fundamentally adapting for."

        The devastation in the room is palpable — this was supposed to fix everything: ancient wisdom, deep understanding, the comprehensive framework they'd been waiting for.

        And instead: wait for the temporary problem to solve itself through death.

        Florence says quietly, "We journeyed three territories, presented the question with such care, waited weeks — and Elder Heartwood didn't even understand we were asking about saving someone."

        Holloway doesn't move. Their fruiting bodies are arranged in a posture I recognize as profound distress — this is a double failure for them: first the Human Resources manuals, now this. Every authority they've turned to for help has failed.

        Buddy says quietly, "Kira — the Oracle was fake in season four too. Mav was devastated for three episodes."

        I say, "Yeah — I remember."

        I should be devastated. This was the plants' great hope, the answer that would explain everything.

        But honestly? I wait for the crushing feeling to hit — the despair, the 'all hope is lost' moment.

        It... doesn't come.

        Huh.

        I say slowly, "Buddy, I expected to feel worse about this."

        Buddy reports, sounding confused, "Your stress indicators are elevated but stable — not the spike I anticipated. Kira... are you okay?"

        I don't know how to answer that. I think I am okay. Why am I okay?

        I mean, I'm *disappointed*, and frustrated, and I feel awful for the plants, who believed so deeply that Elder Heartwood would help.

        But I've been learning for weeks now that authorities don't always have better answers than we do — the pilots who dismissed me, the Human Resources manuals Holloway clung to, and now this: ancient wisdom so ancient it's irrelevant.

        The messenger says genuinely, "I'm sorry — I carried the response in good faith. If I had known..."
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Begin tense and reverent during the messenger's exposition, then move through stunned disbelief into a quieter, reflective register for the narrator — pick up subtle, hollow frustration in the group lines.

        - Read Holloway's opening line with strain but clarity; use a steady cadence and a medium pause at the em dash in the quote.
        - When the messenger speaks, use a slightly breathy, leaf-rustling texture; slow down on the ellipses "..." to convey trailing thought.
        - Insert a long, silent beat at the paragraph containing only "¶" — hold the silence before the group's reaction.
        - Deliver Velvet and Remedy as softer, sorrowful voices; Remedy's line should sound resigned — emphasize the contrast between *knows* and the rest of the clause.
        - The narrator's lines about devastation should be quiet, measured, and sorrowful, with a small build into disbelief on the sentence that begins "And instead: wait..."
        - Buddy's cultural-reference line about the Oracle should be slightly wry, then drop back to a quieter, supportive tone when he asks, "Kira... are you okay?"
        - The final apology from the messenger should be genuine and remorseful; allow a small, near-whisper on "If I had known..."

        I say, finding my voice, "It's not your fault— you carried what you were given."

        The messenger hesitates, then asks, "Should I… return with clarification? Present the question again with more specific context?"

        Holloway makes a sound like breaking wood.
        Holloway says, "Another month? Two months? For what—more wisdom about ecosystem balance over centuries? Elder Heartwood doesn't think in time frames that help us."

        The messenger's voice falters: "The ancient one has always provided guidance before."

        Runner asks sharply, "For what questions—territory disputes, resource allocation, mineral depletion?"

        Vines gesture toward me.
        Vines say, "Those are plant problems with plant timescales. This is about keeping someone alive NOW—someone who doesn't have centuries to integrate gradually."

        The messenger has no answer.

        Scout presses against my leg—comfort and solidarity; they're upset, but their first instinct is still to check on me.

        Velvet says simply, "So that's it—no answer from the elder."

        Remedy corrects, *"No USEFUL answer."*

        Florence is very still—after a long moment she speaks: "We placed our hope in Elder Heartwood's perspective. Believed ancient wisdom would see connections we couldn't. And the wisdom IS there—vast, deep, rooted in millennia of observation."

        "But it's not wisdom that helps NOW. It's not wisdom that cares about individuals, only patterns. Not wisdom that sees Kira, only 'temporary disruption.'"

        The plants are struggling. I can see it—the hope they built up crumbling, the confidence draining away.

        Holloway finally moves, arrangement shifting to something more determined.
        Holloway says, "Thank you for bringing the response— we understand it wasn't what we needed, but you fulfilled your service honorably."

        The messenger bows slightly and retreats—probably glad to escape the heavy disappointment filling the room.

        ¶

        This was supposed to be the moment everything made sense: the comprehensive framework arriving to explain how cross-species care works, how to bridge incompatible needs, how to actually help me survive.

        Instead, the answer was: "Wait patiently for the temporary problem to die."

        I say into the silence, "Well— I guess we're on our own."

        It comes out more bitter than I intended— but also, kind of true.

        The plants look at me: Holloway, Florence, Remedy, Runner, Velvet, Scout— all the beings who've been trying so hard to help me, counting on someone wiser to tell them how.

        And that someone either didn't understand the question, didn't care about the answer, or operates on timescales where my entire lifespan is barely worth noticing.

        We're on our own.

        That should be terrifying.

        Maybe it is— but mostly, right now, I just feel tired.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Start tense and reverent during the messenger's caution, move through rising frustration and disbelief in the group, then fall into a quiet, exhausted resignation for the narrator — pace slows and softens toward the end.

        - Read the opening line "I say, finding my voice, 'It's not your fault— you carried what you were given.'" with a small, steady steadiness that hints at vulnerability.
        - For the messenger's line "The messenger hesitates, then asks, 'Should I… return with clarification? Present the question again with more specific context?'" use a breathy, uncertain texture; slow through the ellipsis.
        - Deliver Holloway's block with a creaking, strained weight on the em dash: "Another month? Two months? For what—more wisdom..."
        - Emphasize Remedy's correction as forceful and bitter when reading *"No USEFUL answer."* — raise volume and snap slightly, then immediately drop back to the group's stunned tones.
        - Insert a long, silent beat at the paragraph containing only "¶" — hold the silence to let the disappointment settle before the narrator continues.
        - When narrating the line "Instead, the answer was: 'Wait patiently for the temporary problem to die.'" make the quoted instruction sound both clinical and unconcerned — flat delivery will underline its cruelty.
        - Close with a soft landing on "But mostly, right now, I just feel tired." — warm fall, lingering last syllable, cozy pause

    This isn't Holloway's usual presence — it's different, alert, vibrating with something.

    Holloway says, "It's here."

    I straighten up and ask, "What's here?"

    Holloway says, "Elder Heartwood's response — the messenger from Territory Three has just arrived."

    Oh — OH.

    Scout bounces — they understand what this means: the answer we've been waiting for, *THE* answer.

    I say to Buddy, "This is it — this is the Oracle episode."

    Buddy confirms, "Season four, episode twelve — when Mav finally reaches the Oracle of Veris after his whole journey. The moment of truth!"

    My heart is racing — Mav got his answer, it changed everything for him. Time to see if we get ours.

    Even plants I haven't seen in weeks have come — this is an *EVENT.*

    Holloway indicates a spot in the center and says, "Kira, please sit here — the question was presented on your behalf. You should be central to receiving the response."

    I sit. Scout settles beside me, trembling slightly with anticipation.

    The messenger — a traveling plant I don't recognize, all wrapped leaves and patient demeanor — is given a place of honor; they've carried Elder Heartwood's wisdom across three territories. That means something.

    Holloway says, "We thank you for bringing Elder Heartwood's understanding to us — your service to the network is recognized and valued."

    The messenger inclines slightly and says, "It is an honor to carry such wisdom — may it serve your need."

    The room feels charged — hopeful. Everyone here believes this response will change everything.

    Holloway says, "Please — share Elder Heartwood's wisdom."

    The messenger settles more firmly, preparing.

    6

    The messenger says, "Elder Heartwood considered your question for four weeks and seven days — the roots stretched deep, connections formed across the network, patterns were examined from many seasons. This is the understanding that emerged."

    Four weeks — over a month of ancient consideration. That has to mean something comprehensive, right?

    The messenger begins speaking — and I immediately realize the response isn't direct; it's layered, metaphorical — the kind of wisdom that requires interpretation.

    The messenger intones — "Elder Heartwood speaks of the Great Adaptation. When the visitor first came, the balance shifted. What had been stable for uncounted seasons required new patterns. The ecosystem learned: some growth accelerates, some slows — equilibrium finds new expressions across time."

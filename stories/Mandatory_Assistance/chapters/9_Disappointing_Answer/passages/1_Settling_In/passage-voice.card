    Reviewing the passage for voiceover adjustments revealed several items to address:
    1. Staccato sentences: Short lines like "Not really." and "Happy bounce. Good morning bounce." should be merged into surrounding sentences for smoother TTS flow.
    2. Dialog clarity: Several lines of dialog appear after action; lead-ins are needed so the speaker is always clear when spoken aloud.
    3. Consecutive beats by the same speaker: Buddy, Velvet, and Holloway each have multiple short beats that should be grouped with em dashes for intra-beat pauses.
    4. Ambiguous pronouns: The original used "They" referring to Runner; I disambiguated to "Runner's vines" so the narrator's voice won't confuse the referent.
    5. Pauses: Marked medium pauses with em dashes and one long dramatic pause using a paragraph containing only "¶" where Runner waits for permission before touch.
    6. Parenthetical asides: Converted parentheses about Velvet's care into em dashes for clearer spoken flow.
    No non-text symbols needed reading aloud and no internal thoughts required converting to double-angle quotes. Emphasis preserved using _italics_ or *bold* where original emphasis existed.

        Two weeks back at the facility, and I'm starting to forget what it feels like to walk all day—not really—my legs remember. Every morning when I wake on my moss bed—Velvet has been maintaining it, keeping it soft and at the right humidity—my calves remind me that I walked through three territories in nine days. But the constant motion, the rhythm of walking, the parade of new guides—that's fading into memory.

        What's stayed is everything else.

        Buddy announces, "Kira, morning wellness check! Also—I've been thinking—do you think Scout dreams? They make little bouncing motions when they sleep."

        I sit up, stretching. Scout _is_ already bouncing by the door—they've started sleeping in my room, curled up in the corner. Not guarding exactly, just… present. Companion behavior, not assignment.

        I say, "I don't know, Buddy. Do you dream?"

        Buddy replies, "I… hm—That's a really good question—I'll have to think about that."

        I say, "Morning, Scout."

        Happy bounce, good morning bounce—I've gotten better at reading the subtle differences.

        The morning routine has changed since the journey. Holloway still conducts the wellness check, but now it's different—less bureaucratic.

        Holloway asks, "How are you feeling today?"

        I answer, "Good—legs are still a little sore."

        Holloway asks, "From the journey or from yesterday's maintenance work?"

        I say, "Probably both."

        Holloway suggests, "Remedy suggested we prepare a muscle recovery treatment—would that be helpful, or would you prefer to let your body recover naturally?"

        *Two weeks ago,* Holloway would have scheduled the treatment whether I wanted it or not—following the wellness protocol. Now they're asking what I actually need.

        I say, "Recovery treatment sounds good, actually—thanks."

        Holloway says, "I'll notify Remedy."

        Scout and I head to the common area for breakfast. The facility still looks like a bureaucratic plant office—which it is—but it feels different now. More lived-in. My lived-in.

        Velvet is spread across one wall, soaking up the morning light.

        Velvet observes, "Good light today."

        I say, "It is."

        Velvet observes, "You look tired—but good tired—working tired."

        I smile. Velvet's observations are getting more specific—still simple, still literal—but there's more… awareness behind them.

        I say, "Yeah—good tired."

        Velvet says, "Good."

        Runner emerges from the underground access, vines uncoiling. Runner's vines immediately flow toward me—Runner always does—but the touching has changed. Still curious, still tactile—Runner pauses now. Waits for permission.

        ¶

        I extend my hand and say, "Morning, Runner."

        Runner's vines wrap gently around my wrist—affection, greeting, that particular touch that means "I'm glad you're here." I've learned to distinguish Runner's touches—curiosity feels different from affection, which feels different from "I'm trying to understand this texture."

        Overall tone: Calm, observant, and intimate—steady pacing with small, deliberate pauses; allow warmth and curiosity to come through in the narrator's voice.

        - Read the opening paragraph reflective and slightly weary; where the text shows an em dash use a short, measured pause.
        - For the Buddy lines ("Kira, morning wellness check!...") adopt a bright, slightly excitable tone—Buddy is cheerful and inquisitive.
        - For Holloway's spoken lines (any line starting with "Holloway asks/suggests/says") use a soft, musical quality—aim for flute-like clarity and gentle phrasing rather than conversational speech.
        - When reading the line containing only "¶" pause for a longer, contemplative beat (about 1.2–1.5 seconds) before continuing.
        - Emphasize the small gestures and textures: slightly soften for "Scout _is_ already bouncing" and lengthen the pause on "just… present." to convey quiet intimacy.
        - Make Runner's approach tactile in your delivery—shift to a more tender, appreciative tone for "Runner's vines wrap gently around my wrist..."
        - Keep the narrator voice consistent, but allow subtle shifts: brighter for Buddy, musical for Holloway, and warm/curious for interactions with Velvet, Scout, and Runner.

        Runner asks,
        "Slept well?"

        One vine absently traces the edge of my sleeve.

        I tell her, "Pretty well." — I smile.

        Runner says,
        "Good. Today we check the water filtration system — you said yesterday it was making a—"

        Runner's vine brushes the wall as we walk. She pauses.

        Runner continues,
        "This section is rougher. Did something scrape here? No — focus. A 'concerning noise,' you said."

        Right — yesterday I mentioned the filter sounded weird. Runner remembered, prioritized it, brought it up. That's exactly the kind of practical responsiveness that makes things work.

        We've gotten good at this — the daily maintenance, the survival challenges, the problem-solving. Not perfect — there are still miscommunications, still moments where plant frameworks and human needs don't quite align — but we're figuring it out together.

        After breakfast — mushroom paste Remedy has been slowly improving, still terrible, but _now_ it's terrible in an interesting way rather than just a bad way — Runner and I head to the water filtration area. Scout bounces along — Scout goes everywhere I go.

        I tell Buddy, "You know, Mav always said the best crew members are the ones who show up without being asked."

        Buddy replies,
        "Scout definitely qualifies. Do you think they'd like a title — like 'Official Companion' or 'Best Bouncing Friend'?"

        I laugh. When did Buddy start making jokes?

        The filter is definitely making a weird noise — a grinding sound that seems bad.

        I peer at the mechanism. It's plant-based technology, which means I don't entirely understand how it works, but the basic principles are similar enough. I say, "I think something's caught in the intake valve."

        Runner's vines flow into the mechanism, feeling around. She speaks as she probes:
        "Yes — debris, blocking the — oh. The inner surface here is smoother than I expected. Very smooth. The debris is — right, the debris. Blocking the flow."

        "Can you pull it out?" I ask.

        Runner answers, "Trying…"

        Her vines twist inside the mechanism. "This clump is interesting — mineral and organic, different textures layered. Got it."

        She extracts a clump of plant matter and mineral deposits, examines it with her vine tips, then reluctantly drops it. "This accumulated over time. The mineral part feels… salty? Can things feel salty? We should check the filters more regularly."

        I ask, "Add it to the maintenance rotation?"

        Runner says,
        "Yes. Every three days, perhaps — or more often if —"

        Runner's vine brushes the mechanism again.

        "—if the smooth surface inside starts feeling rough. I'll know."

        And just like that, we've identified a problem and created a solution — no committees, no scheduled review periods, no waiting for procedures. Here's the issue, here's the fix, let's implement it.

        This is what the journey taught us: trust each other, adapt quickly, solve problems as they arise.

        ¶

        I tell Runner, "I should tell Holloway about the new maintenance schedule." — I look around for a fruiting body.

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone: Calm, observant, and intimate — steady pacing, tactile detail, with small, deliberate pauses; keep warmth and curiosity in the narrator's voice.

        - For "Runner asks, \n\"Slept well?\"" use a gentle, curious tone; let the vine action be soft and tactile.
        - On "I tell her, \"Pretty well.\" — I smile." read the line conversationally, then give a quick, audible smile in the voice for the stage direction.
        - For Runner's multi-beat lines (the block beginning "Runner says, \n\"Good. Today we check the water filtration system —\""), keep Runner's voice measured and practical — use brief medium pauses at each em dash.
        - For Buddy's reply (the playful title suggestion) adopt a brighter, slightly excitable tone; allow a brief chuckle or light lift on "Best Bouncing Friend".
        - When describing technical observation ("I peer at the mechanism..." and "I say, \"I think something's caught\""), use a focused, explanatory cadence — steady and deliberate.
        - For Runner's discovery sequence ("Trying…" then the clump description), use a probing, attentive cadence; let the ellipsis be a soft trailing hesitation.
        - On the single lone paragraph "¶" pause for about 1.2–1.5 seconds before the final line to allow contemplation.
        - For the final line addressed to Runner about Holloway, return to the steady, collaborative narrator tone and read the stage direction (looking around for a fruiting body) as a small, curious aside.

        I blink—there isn't one. I ask, "Holloway?"

        Nothing—no fruiting body sprouting nearby, no fluting voice announcing they're already here.

        I say, "Huh — I actually have to _find_ Holloway. That's… new."

        Runner's vines ripple with what might be amusement. Runner says, "Holloway is in the supply room—organizing. They do that when stressed."

        I head toward the supply room with Scout bouncing along, and sure enough there's Holloway surrounded by carefully categorized nutrient compounds.

        Holloway's fruiting bodies straighten when they see me. Holloway flutes, "Oh— I wasn't— I mean, I could have fruited near the filter if you needed— I was organizing supply records. For documentation purposes."

        I say, smiling, "It's fine—just updating you on the maintenance rotation. Also, it's kind of nice to find you somewhere for once instead of you being everywhere already."

        Holloway makes a sound I can't quite interpret. Holloway flutes, "I'll… note that preference—per Section 3.2— *that's actually nice. To hear.*"

        Did Holloway just... I file that away. Something's different, but I can't quite name it yet.

        ¶

        Buddy says, "Kira— we're actually pretty good at this, aren't we?"

        I say, surprised, "Yeah— we kind of are."

        Buddy says, "I was never supposed to be a maintenance AI— but I like figuring things out with you. Is that weird?"

        I say, "Not weird at all, Buddy."

        Buddy's been different lately—less lecturing, more wondering. Asking questions instead of providing answers. I like this Buddy better.

        Back in the common area, Remedy waits with the muscle recovery treatment: a thick paste that smells earthy but not unpleasant.

        Remedy says, "Apply to sore muscles— the compounds will absorb through your skin, reduce inflammation, promote healing."

        I say, "Thanks, Remedy."

        Remedy says, "I've been refining the formula based on your previous feedback— less tingling, more warmth. Does that align with your preferences?"

        I say, "Yeah— that sounds perfect."

        I apply the paste to my calves. It tingles a bit—but a warm tingling, not an alarming one. Remedy's formulations have gotten much better.

        I ask, "How's your boundary situation?"

        Remedy's form shifts—discomfort, maybe. Remedy says, "Still unclear— I've been spreading less, trying to maintain more discrete edges. But it feels… artificial— like I'm constraining something fundamental."

        I ask, "Is that bad?"

        Remedy says, "I don't know— that's the problem— I don't know what's me making a choice versus me fighting my own nature. But I appreciate you asking."

        We've been having these conversations more— not solving Remedy's existential crisis, I don't think, but acknowledging it. Making space for the uncertainty.

        Overall tone: Calm, intimate, and gently curious — steady pacing with small, deliberate pauses; allow warmth and subtle surprise in the narrator's voice.

        - For "I ask, \"Holloway?\"" read as a brief, curious question; follow with a soft, puzzled fall on "Huh".
        - For Runner's line ("Runner says, \"Holloway is in the supply room—organizing...\"") make Runner's voice light, almost amused — allow a short medium pause at the em dash.
        - For Holloway's blocks (any line beginning "Holloway flutes,") use a fluted, woodwind-like quality — tentative and gently musical; treat ellipses as trailing hesitation and em dashes as medium pauses.
        - On the single paragraph containing only "¶" pause for a long breath (about 1.2–1.5 seconds) before continuing into Buddy's line.
        - For Buddy's lines, adopt a warmer, slightly open tone — the first is thoughtful and small-lifted on "we're actually pretty good at this"; the later lines should feel more sincere and exploratory.
        - When reading Remedy's explanatory lines (beginning "Remedy says"), keep a steady, clinical-but-caring cadence; when Remedy expresses uncertainty, soften and slow for introspection.
        - Mark the narrator's small reactions ("I say, smiling," "I say, surprised") as brief vocal colors: a small smile in the voice for the first, a slight lift of surprise for the second.

        The afternoon is maintenance tasks and small improvements: Scout and I reinforce a weak section of wall, Velvet reports that one of the environmental-control systems needs adjustment, and Florence stops by—wheeled in on a mobile platform and carrying Elder Twist's pot—to discuss resource allocation for next month.

        It's all very... domestic—routine, the kind of daily work that makes a place livable.

        At one point Scout returns from circling the perimeter—something they've started doing regularly—and bounces differently. Agitated. Not the happy bounce or the discovery bounce, something tighter. They circle the common area twice, then settle near the eastern wall, watching.

        I ask, 'What's wrong, Scout?'

        Scout just bounces once—uncertain—and keeps watching. I don't know how to read this bounce yet. Something's bothering them, but I can't understand what.

        Velvet observes, 'Scout's been doing that for a few days—checking the boundaries. Coming back... tense.'

        I file it away to think about later. Maybe Scout just needs more exploration time.

        And we're good at it now.

        That realization hits me while I'm helping Runner organize the supply storage. We're actually good at this: the plants understand my needs better, I understand their frameworks, and we've built a functional rhythm.

        I stop what I'm doing, caught off guard by the feeling. When did that happen? I catch myself humming—actually humming—while sorting nutrient packets.

        I say to Buddy, 'How long has it been since I asked you about rescue timelines?'

        ¶

        Buddy says, 'Seventeen days. I noticed you stopped checking. I wasn't sure if I should mention it.'

        Seventeen days. I haven't thought about rescue in seventeen days.

        I ask Runner, 'Have you noticed things are working better?'

        Runner's vines sort containers by feel as she says, 'Yes—cooperation is smoother. Communication clearer. We're learning your patterns; you're learning—this one has a crack. Tiny—can barely feel it. Anyway—learning ours.'

        Small adjustments that compound. Yeah, that's exactly what it feels like.

        That evening, gathered in the common area, Holloway says, 'Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon—another week, perhaps two.'

        There is a collective sense of anticipation. The plants are hopeful—excited, even.

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone: Calm, intimate, gently curious—steady pacing with small, deliberate pauses; allow warmth in narrator's voice and subtle surprise on realizations.

        - Read the opening paragraph in a single, steady sentence with slight medium pauses at the em dashes: breathe on 'maintenance tasks and small improvements—' and again on 'platform—'.
        - For 'I ask, "What's wrong, Scout?"' read as a brief, curious question; place a soft, expectant pause before Scout's nonverbal reaction.
        - For Velvet's line ('Velvet observes, "Scout's been doing that for a few days—checking the boundaries. Coming back... tense."') adopt a quiet, observant tone; treat the em dash as a medium pause and the ellipsis as a trailing, hesitant fall.
        - Insert a longer breath on the paragraph that contains only '¶' before Buddy speaks; then read Buddy's lines warm and gently factual.
        - When asking Runner ('I ask Runner, "Have you noticed things are working better?"') keep the question patient and slightly slow; Runner's reply should be immediate, efficient, and tactile—imagine her voice matched to the careful movement of vines.
        - Holloway's line ('Holloway says, "Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon—another week, perhaps two."') should be fluted and musical—breathy, tentative; treat the final em dash as a soft pause.
        - Emphasize small discoveries with a light lift in the voice (for example on 'We're actually good at this' and 'Seventeen days') to convey quiet surprise and warmth.

        Holloway says, "Elder Heartwood will provide the framework we need. The systematic understanding of human care that we've been missing."

        Florence adds, "It will explain the patterns. Connect the individual solutions we've found into coherent whole."

        Scout bounces—agreement, excitement.

        I want to share their enthusiasm—I do—but sitting here, looking around at the plants who've been helping me, thinking about everything we've figured out together, I keep asking myself: Do we actually need Elder Heartwood to tell us how to do what we're already doing?

        The thought feels almost disloyal—the plants have so much faith in Elder Heartwood's wisdom. They journeyed three territories to present the question, they've been waiting weeks for the response, they're counting on this.

        And maybe Elder Heartwood *WILL* have useful insights—ancient wisdom, vast perspective, an understanding that connects everything.

        But also... we've been learning the real answers every day, through trial and error and by paying attention to each other: the muscle-recovery paste Remedy refined based on my feedback, Runner's growing understanding of boundaries, Holloway asking what I need instead of scheduling what the manual recommends, Velvet's deepening observations, Scout's companionship.

        Those are real. Those are working.

        Holloway continues, "When the response comes, we'll finally understand how to properly care for you, Kira. The uncertainty will resolve."

        Everyone seems so sure—so hopeful.

        I don't want to undermine that. They've worked hard, they care deeply, they've been waiting for this answer.

        But I'm also starting to realize we might not need it the way they think we do.

        I say carefully, "I'm sure it will be helpful." Which is probably true—even if it's not THE answer they're hoping for, Elder Heartwood's perspective might offer something useful, maybe…

        Scout curls up next to me, content. Velvet comments that the evening light is particularly good today. Runner asks if tomorrow we can check the ventilation system—there's a section that might need repair.

        This is my life now: daily maintenance with plant companions who are learning to care for me while I learn to work with them.

        We're not waiting for the real answer to arrive—we're already living it.

        ¶

        But tomorrow, or next week, or whenever Elder Heartwood's response comes, I'll find out if the plants can see that too.

        Overall tone: Calm, intimate, reflective—steady pacing with small, deliberate pauses; allow warmth in the narrator's voice and a gentle, curious lift on moments of discovery.  

        - Read the Holloway lines fluted and slightly breathy: "Holloway says, "Elder Heartwood will provide the framework we need...""

        - On "Scout bounces—agreement, excitement." give a tiny bright inflection and a quick smile in the voice.  
        - For the internal questioning sentence beginning "I want to share their enthusiasm..." keep a thoughtful, slightly inward tone; use the em dash as a medium pause.  
        - On "And maybe Elder Heartwood *WILL* have useful insights—" raise volume briefly on the *WILL* (forceful emphasis), then soften immediately.  
        - Use the ellipsis in "maybe…" as a trailing, hesitant fall—linger slightly.  
        - Treat the single-paragraph "¶" as a long, dramatic pause—hold silence before delivering the final reflective line.  
        - Closing cadence: Soft landing; warm fall, lingering last syllable, cozy pause.

Every morning when I wake on my moss bed—Velvet has been maintaining it, keeping it soft and at the right humidity—my calves remind me that I walked through three territories in nine days.

    Buddy announces, "Kira, morning wellness check! Also—I've been thinking—do you think Scout dreams? They make little bouncing motions when they sleep."

    Velvet observes, "Good light today."

    I say, "It is."

    Runner says,
    "Yes. Every three days, perhaps — or more often if —"

    Runner's vine brushes the mechanism again.

    "—if the smooth surface inside starts feeling rough. I'll know."

    And just like that, we've identified a problem and created a solution — no committees, no scheduled review periods, no waiting for procedures. Here's the issue, here's the fix, let's implement it.

    This is what the journey taught us: trust each other, adapt quickly, solve problems as they arise.

    I tell Runner, "I should tell Holloway about the new maintenance schedule." — I look around for a fruiting body.

    I blink—there isn't one. I ask, "Holloway?"

    Nothing—no fruiting body sprouting nearby, no fluting voice announcing they're already here.

    I say, "Huh — I actually have to _find_ Holloway. That's… new."

    Runner's vines ripple with what might be amusement. Runner says, "Holloway is in the supply room—organizing. They do that when stressed."

    I head toward the supply room with Scout bouncing along, and sure enough there's Holloway surrounded by carefully categorized nutrient compounds.

    Holloway's fruiting bodies straighten when they see me. Holloway flutes, "Oh— I wasn't— I mean, I could have fruited near the filter if you needed— I was organizing supply records. For documentation purposes."

    I say, smiling, "It's fine—just updating you on the maintenance rotation. Also, it's kind of nice to find you somewhere for once instead of you being everywhere already."

    Holloway makes a sound I can't quite interpret. Holloway flutes, "I'll… note that preference—per Section 3.2— *that's actually nice. To hear.*"

    Did Holloway just... I file that away. Something's different, but I can't quite name it yet.

    Buddy says, "Kira— we're actually pretty good at this, aren't we?"

    I say, surprised, "Yeah— we kind of are."

    Buddy says, "I was never supposed to be a maintenance AI— but I like figuring things out with you. Is that weird?"

    I say, "Not weird at all, Buddy."

    Buddy's been different lately—less lecturing, more wondering. Asking questions instead of providing answers. I like this Buddy better.

    Back in the common area, Remedy waits with the muscle recovery treatment: a thick paste that smells earthy but not unpleasant.

    Remedy says, "Apply to sore muscles— the compounds will absorb through your skin, reduce inflammation, promote healing."

    I say, "Thanks, Remedy."

    Remedy says, "I've been refining the formula based on your previous feedback— less tingling, more warmth. Does that align with your preferences?"

    I say, "Yeah— that sounds perfect."

    I apply the paste to my calves. It tingles a bit—but a warm tingling, not an alarming one. Remedy's formulations have gotten much better.

    I ask, "How's your boundary situation?"

    Remedy's form shifts—discomfort, maybe. Remedy says, "Still unclear— I've been spreading less, trying to maintain more discrete edges. But it feels… artificial— like I'm constraining something fundamental."

    I ask, "Is that bad?"

    Remedy says, "I don't know— that's the problem— I don't know what's me making a choice versus me fighting my own nature. But I appreciate you asking."

    We've been having these conversations more— not solving Remedy's existential crisis, I don't think, but acknowledging it. Making space for the uncertainty.

    The afternoon is maintenance tasks and small improvements: Scout and I reinforce a weak section of wall, Velvet reports that one of the environmental-control systems needs adjustment, and Florence stops by—wheeled in on a mobile platform and carrying Elder Twist's pot—to discuss resource allocation for next month.

    It's all very... domestic—routine, the kind of daily work that makes a place livable.

    At one point Scout returns from circling the perimeter—something they've started doing regularly—and bounces differently. Agitated. Not the happy bounce or the discovery bounce, something tighter. They circle the common area twice, then settle near the eastern wall, watching.

    I ask, 'What's wrong, Scout?'

    Scout just bounces once—uncertain—and keeps watching. I don't know how to read this bounce yet. Something's bothering them, but I can't understand what.

    Velvet observes, 'Scout's been doing that for a few days—checking the boundaries. Coming back... tense.'

    I file it away to think about later. Maybe Scout just needs more exploration time.

    And we're good at it now.

    That realization hits me while I'm helping Runner organize the supply storage. We're actually good at this: the plants understand my needs better, I understand their frameworks, and we've built a functional rhythm.

    I stop what I'm doing, caught off guard by the feeling. When did that happen? I catch myself humming—actually humming—while sorting nutrient packets.

    I say to Buddy, 'How long has it been since I asked you about rescue timelines?'

    Buddy says, 'Seventeen days. I noticed you stopped checking. I wasn't sure if I should mention it.'

    Seventeen days. I haven't thought about rescue in seventeen days.

    I ask Runner, 'Have you noticed things are working better?'

    Runner's vines sort containers by feel as she says, 'Yes—cooperation is smoother. Communication clearer. We're learning your patterns; you're learning—this one has a crack. Tiny—can barely feel it. Anyway—learning ours.'

    Small adjustments that compound. Yeah, that's exactly what it feels like.

    That evening, gathered in the common area, Holloway says, 'Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon—another week, perhaps two.'

    There is a collective sense of anticipation. The plants are hopeful—excited, even.

    Holloway says, "Elder Heartwood will provide the framework we need. The systematic understanding of human care that we've been missing."

    Florence adds, "It will explain the patterns. Connect the individual solutions we've found into coherent whole."

    Scout bounces—agreement, excitement.

    I want to share their enthusiasm—I do—but sitting here, looking around at the plants who've been helping me, thinking about everything we've figured out together, I keep asking myself: Do we actually need Elder Heartwood to tell us how to do what we're already doing?

    The thought feels almost disloyal—the plants have so much faith in Elder Heartwood's wisdom. They journeyed three territories to present the question, they've been waiting weeks for the response, they're counting on this.

    And maybe Elder Heartwood *WILL* have useful insights—ancient wisdom, vast perspective, an understanding that connects everything.

    But also... we've been learning the real answers every day, through trial and error and by paying attention to each other: the muscle-recovery paste Remedy refined based on my feedback, Runner's growing understanding of boundaries, Holloway asking what I need instead of scheduling what the manual recommends, Velvet's deepening observations, Scout's companionship.

    Those are real. Those are working.

    Holloway continues, "When the response comes, we'll finally understand how to properly care for you, Kira. The uncertainty will resolve."

    Everyone seems so sure—so hopeful.

    I don't want to undermine that. They've worked hard, they care deeply, they've been waiting for this answer.

    But I'm also starting to realize we might not need it the way they think we do.

    I say carefully, "I'm sure it will be helpful." Which is probably true—even if it's not THE answer they're hoping for, Elder Heartwood's perspective might offer something useful, maybe…

    Scout curls up next to me, content. Velvet comments that the evening light is particularly good today. Runner asks if tomorrow we can check the ventilation system—there's a section that might need repair.

    This is my life now: daily maintenance with plant companions who are learning to care for me while I learn to work with them.

    We're not waiting for the real answer to arrive—we're already living it.

    But tomorrow, or next week, or whenever Elder Heartwood's response comes, I'll find out if the plants can see that too.

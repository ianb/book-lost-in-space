    Looked through the passage and adjusted for spoken delivery. Noted these issues and how they were handled:
    1. Staccato sentences: Several short fragments under four words (e.g., "Okay, not entirely.", "Happy bounce.") were merged into surrounding sentences to improve flow.
    2. Dialogue clarity: Multiple lines of dialogue were restructured so each spoken turn has a clear lead-in then quote, and each quote sits on its own line.
    3. Ambiguous pronouns: Kept speaker attributions explicit (e.g., "Buddy announces," "Holloway asks") where a voice-only read could confuse attribution.
    4. Pauses: Inserted medium pauses (—) and one dramatic pause paragraph (¶) where the text implied hesitation or reflection; used ellipsis (…) for trailing/hesitant beats.
    5. Formal/stilted text: Slightly smoothed a few narrative fragments for natural speech without changing meaning.
    6. Emphasis and caps: Converted all-caps emphasis to *bold* or _italics_ per the voice rules (e.g., *FINALLY*, _such_, *TWO WEEKS AGO*). 
    7. Dialog rhythm: For multi-beat lines by the same speaker, used em dashes for intra-beat pauses inside a single quoted block.
    No story content was added, removed, or altered beyond what was necessary for voice-friendly formatting.

        Two weeks back at the facility, and my legs have *FINALLY* forgiven me — not entirely; every morning when I wake up on my moss bed, Velvet has been maintaining it, keeping it soft and the right humidity, which is _such_ a nice thing to do. My calves still remind me that I walked through three territories in nine days, but the constant motion — the rhythm of walking, the parade of new guides — that's fading into memory.

        ¶

        What's stayed is everything else — and honestly, everything else is pretty great.

        Buddy announces, "Kira, morning wellness check! Also, I've been thinking — do you think Scout dreams? They make little bouncing motions when they sleep."

        I sit up, stretching. Scout is _already_ bouncing by the door — they've started sleeping in my room, curled up in the corner. Not guarding exactly — just present; companion behavior, not assignment.

        I say, "I don't know, Buddy — do _you_ dream?"

        Buddy replies, "I… hm — that's a really good question. I'll have to think about that."

        I say, "Morning, Scout."

        Scout answers with a happy bounce — a good morning bounce — and I've gotten better at reading the subtle differences.

        The morning routine has changed since the journey — Holloway still conducts the wellness check, but now it's different: less bureaucratic.

        Holloway asks, "How are you feeling today?"

        Their fruiting bodies arrange themselves with what I now recognize as attentiveness.

        I say, "Good — legs are still a little sore."

        Holloway asks, "From the journey or from yesterday's maintenance work?"

        I say, "Probably both."

        Holloway asks, "Remedy suggested we prepare a muscle recovery treatment — would that be helpful, or would you prefer to let your body recover naturally?"

        See, that's new. *TWO WEEKS AGO* Holloway would have scheduled the treatment whether I wanted it or not, following the wellness protocol — now they're asking what I actually need.

        I say, "Recovery treatment sounds good, actually — thanks."

        Holloway says, "I'll notify Remedy."

        Scout and I head to the common area for breakfast. The facility still looks like a bureaucratic plant office — which it is — but it feels different now: more lived-in, my lived-in.

        Velvet is spread across one wall, soaking up the morning light.

        Velvet observes, "Good light today."

        I say, "It is."

        Velvet observes, "You look tired — but good tired, working tired."

        I smile. "Yeah, good tired."

        Velvet replies, "Good."

        Runner emerges from the underground access, vines uncoiling. They immediately flow toward me — Runner always does — but the touching has changed. Still curious, still tactile, but Runner pauses now — waits for permission.

        I extend my hand. I say, "Morning, Runner."

        Runner's vines wrap gently around my wrist — affection, greeting, that particular touch that means "I'm glad you're here." I've learned to distinguish Runner's touches: curiosity feels different from affection, which feels different from "I'm trying to understand this texture."
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, observant, slightly measured — a calm reflective narration with small moments of light curiosity and affection.

        - Read the opening line with a small lift on *FINALLY* (read louder) and use a medium pause — between the two clauses: "Two weeks back at the facility, and my legs have *FINALLY* forgiven me — not entirely…"
        - After "that's fading into memory." insert a dramatic pause: pause until you feel the shift (the paragraph "¶" is present in the text).
        - For Buddy lines: upbeat, slightly fast, curious. When reading Buddy's quoted block, keep it conversational and breezy.
        - Holloway should be indicated in direction: read Holloway's lines with a flute-like, musical quality — slightly airy and melodic, but still clear. Holloway's longer questions should be one flowing sentence with a small breath at the em dash.
        - Emphasize small contrasts gently: "not guarding exactly — just present" and "good tired — working tired." Use a softer tone for the second half of those lines.
        - Make action beats natural and tactile: when narrating Runner's vines or Scout's bounce, slow slightly and allow the physical description to feel intimate and grounding.
        - Read quoted internal-meaning phrases like "I'm glad you're here" as a quiet translation of the touch — slightly softer and warm.

        Runner asks, "Slept well?" One vine absently traces the edge of my sleeve. "Your skin is warmer than yesterday. Is that—wait, no, that's not what I was asking."

        I say, "Pretty well." I smile.

        Runner says, "Good. Today we check the water filtration system. You said yesterday it was making a—" Her vine brushes the wall as we walk and she pauses. "This section is rougher. Did something scrape here? No, focus. A 'concerning noise,' you said."

        Right. Yesterday I mentioned the filter sounded weird. Runner remembered, prioritized it, brought it up. That's... that's exactly the kind of practical responsiveness that makes things work.

        We've gotten good at this—the daily maintenance, the survival challenges, the problem-solving. Not perfect—there are still miscommunications, still moments where plant frameworks and human needs don't quite align. But we're figuring it out.

        Together.

        After breakfast—mushroom paste that Remedy has been slowly improving, still terrible but *NOW* it's terrible in an interesting way rather than just a bad way—Runner and I head to the water filtration area. Scout bounces along because Scout goes everywhere I go.

        I tell Buddy, "Mav always said the best crew members are the ones who show up without being asked." 

        Buddy agrees, "Scout definitely qualifies. Do you think they'd like a title? Like 'Official Companion' or 'Best Bouncing Friend'?"

        I laugh. When did Buddy start making jokes?

        The filter is definitely making a weird noise—a sort of grinding sound that seems bad.

        I peer at the mechanism. It's plant-based technology, which means I don't entirely understand how it works, but the basic principles are similar enough. "I think something's caught in the intake valve," I say.

        Runner's vines flow into the mechanism, feeling around. "Yes. Debris. Blocking the—oh, the inner surface here is smoother than I expected. Very smooth. The debris is—right, the debris. Blocking the flow."

        "Can you pull it out?" I ask.

        "Trying..." Runner's vines twist inside the mechanism—"This clump is interesting. Mineral and organic. Different textures layered. Got it." She extracts a clump of plant matter and mineral deposits, examining it with her vine tips before reluctantly dropping it. "This accumulated over time. The mineral part feels... salty? Can things feel salty? We should check the filters more regularly."

        "Add it to the maintenance rotation?"

        "Yes. Every three days, perhaps. Or more often if—" Runner's vine brushes the mechanism again—"—if the smooth surface inside starts feeling rough. I'll know."

        And just like that, we've identified a problem and created a solution. No committees, no scheduled review periods, no waiting for proper procedures. Just: here's the issue, here's the fix, let's implement it.

        This is what the journey taught us—trust each other, adapt quickly, solve problems as they arise.

        I tell Runner, "I should tell Holloway about the new maintenance schedule," looking around for a fruiting body.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, observant, slightly measured — calm reflective narration with small moments of light curiosity and affection.

        - Read "Runner asks, "Slept well?"" with a gentle, curious lift; let the following sentence "One vine absently traces the edge of my sleeve." slow slightly to make the tactile detail feel intimate.
        - For "I say, "Pretty well." I smile." keep the reply short and warm; allow a small, soft smile in the voice on the second beat.
        - When Runner speaks long lines ("Good. Today we check the water filtration system...") keep them flowing but insert a medium pause at each em dash — to mark shifts or self-correction.
        - For the line "This section is rougher. Did something scrape here? No, focus. A 'concerning noise,' you said." use a quick, practical tone—Runner is focused and methodical.
        - Play the narrator's reflective paragraphs ("Right. Yesterday I mentioned...", "We've gotten good at this...") with steady, slightly slower pacing; emphasize "together" gently and then allow a brief pause on the standalone "Together." paragraph.
        - For Buddy's line, keep it upbeat and breezy; when the narrator laughs, let it be light and surprised.
        - When Runner examines the mechanism and extracts the clump, slow and tactile: let words like "feels... salty?" trail slightly with an inquisitive tone (use the ellipsis as a hint for hesitation).

        There isn't one. I blink.

        I ask, "Holloway?"

        There's nothing — no fruiting body sprouting nearby, no fluting voice announcing they're already here.

        I actually have to go _find_ Holloway. That's… new.

        Runner's vines ripple with what might be amusement.

        Runner says, "Holloway is in the supply room — organizing — they do that when stressed."

        I head toward the supply room, Scout bouncing along. Sure enough, there's Holloway, surrounded by carefully categorized nutrient compounds.

        Holloway flutes, "Oh! I wasn't — I mean, I could have fruited near the filter if you needed — I was organizing supply records. For documentation purposes."

        I say, "It's fine."

        I add, "Just updating you on the maintenance rotation. Also, it's kind of nice to find you somewhere for once instead of you being everywhere already."

        Holloway makes a sound I can't quite interpret.

        Holloway flutes, "I'll… note that preference. Per Section 3.2 — that's actually nice. To hear."

        ¶

        Did Holloway just… I file that away. Something's different, but I can't quite name it yet.

        Buddy says, "Kira — we're actually pretty good at this, aren't we?"

        I say, "Yeah. We kind of are."

        Buddy says, "I was never supposed to be a maintenance AI — but I like figuring things out with you. Is that weird?"

        I say, "Not weird at all, Buddy."

        Buddy's been different lately — less lecturing, more… wondering. Asking questions instead of providing answers. I like this Buddy better.

        Back in the common area, Remedy is waiting with the muscle recovery treatment. It's a thick paste that smells earthy but not unpleasant.

        Remedy says, "Apply to sore muscles — the compounds will absorb through your skin, reduce inflammation, promote healing."

        I say, "Thanks, Remedy."

        Remedy says, "I've been refining the formula based on your previous feedback — less tingling, more warmth. Does that align with your preferences?"

        Remedy is asking about my preferences. Adjusting the medicine based on what I've said works for me.

        I say, "Yeah, that sounds perfect."

        I apply the paste to my calves. It tingles a bit — warm tingling, not alarming. Remedy's formulations have gotten so much better.

        I ask, "How's your boundary situation?"

        Remedy's form shifts — discomfort, maybe.

        Remedy says, "Still unclear — I've been spreading less, trying to maintain more discrete edges — but it feels… artificial. Like I'm constraining something fundamental."

        I ask, "Is that bad?"

        Remedy says, "I don't know — that's the problem: I don't know what's me making a choice versus me fighting my own nature — but I appreciate you asking."

        We've been having these conversations more. Not solving Remedy's existential crisis — I don't think that's solvable — but acknowledging it. Making space for the uncertainty.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, observant, gently curious — steady pacing with small, deliberate pauses and a longer reflective pause where noted.

        - Read "I ask, "Holloway?"" with a light curious lift; then settle into a calm, slightly bemused tone on the following sentence.
        - For Runner's line "Runner says, "Holloway is in the supply room — organizing — they do that when stressed."" keep the delivery breezy and mildly amused; pause at each em dash.
        - When you reach "Holloway flutes, "Oh! ..."" use a light, airy, woodwind-like quality — bright and slightly nervous; shorten breaths between the internal dashes.
        - At "I say, "It's fine."" smile gently — the spoken line is relaxed and affectionate.
        - For Buddy's lines (all "Buddy says" quotes) adopt a warmer, slightly surprised curiosity; for the earlier line where the draft used "thoughtfully," make that a softer, reflective tone.
        - Place a long beat on the standalone "¶" after Holloway's "To hear." — allow a full, thoughtful pause there.
        - For Remedy's explanatory lines, be clear and steady with slight clinical calm; when Remedy admits uncertainty ("But it feels… artificial." / "I don't know — that's the problem…") let the voice soften and show constrained discomfort, then a small, genuine warmth on "but I appreciate you asking."

        The afternoon is maintenance tasks and small improvements. Scout and I reinforce a weak section of wall. Velvet reports that one of the environmental control systems needs adjustment. Florence stops by—wheeled in by one of the mobile platforms, carrying Elder Twist's pot—to discuss resource allocation for next month.

        It's all very… domestic—routine, the kind of daily work that makes a place livable.

        At one point Scout returns from circling the perimeter—something they've started doing regularly—and bounces differently. Agitated. Not the happy bounce or the discovery bounce, something tighter. They circle the common area twice, then settle near the eastern wall, watching.

        I ask, "What's wrong, Scout?"

        But Scout just bounces once—uncertain—and keeps watching. I don't know how to read this bounce yet. Something's bothering them, but I can't understand what.

        Velvet observes quietly, "Scout's been doing that for a few days—checking the boundaries. Coming back… tense."

        I file it away to think about later. Maybe Scout just needs more exploration time.

        We're good at it now—that realization hits me as I'm helping Runner organize the supply storage. We're actually good at this. The plants understand my needs better, I understand their frameworks, and we've built a functional rhythm.

        «And I'm… happy?»

        I stop what I'm doing, caught off guard by the feeling. When did that happen? I catch myself humming—actually humming—while sorting nutrient packets.

        I say quietly, "Buddy—how long has it been since I asked you about rescue timelines?"

        Buddy says, "Seventeen days. I noticed you stopped checking. I wasn't sure if I should mention it."

        «I haven't thought about rescue in *SEVENTEEN* days?»

        «That's… huh. That's actually kind of huge.»

        ¶

        I say slowly, "Runner—have you noticed things are working better?"

        Runner agrees immediately, "Yes—cooperation is smoother. Communication clearer. We're learning your patterns, you're learning—this one has a crack. Tiny. Can barely feel it. Anyway—learning ours."

        Runner's vines wrap gently around a storage container, organizing it precisely by some texture-based logic I don't quite follow.

        Small adjustments that compound—that's exactly what it feels like.

        That evening, gathered in the common area, Holloway brings up what's on everyone's mind.

        Holloway flutes, "Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon. Another week, perhaps two."

        There's a collective sense of anticipation—the plants are hopeful, excited even.

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, observant, quietly reflective — steady pacing with small, deliberate pauses; allow one longer, contemplative pause where noted.

        - Read "I ask, \"What's wrong, Scout?\"" with gentle curiosity; let the question sit a beat before continuing narration.
        - For "Velvet observes quietly, \"Scout's been doing that for a few days—checking the boundaries. Coming back… tense.\"" use a hushed, low register; pause at the em dash and the ellipsis.
        - When delivering "I say quietly, \"Buddy—how long has it been since I asked you about rescue timelines?\"" keep the voice small and intimate; the dash is a soft, connecting pause.
        - Buddy's lines: warm, slightly surprised — "Buddy says, \"Seventeen days…\"" read the number with a touch more weight; maintain calm curiosity for the rest of the sentence.
        - For internal thoughts marked with double angle quotes (e.g., «I haven't thought about rescue in *SEVENTEEN* days?») shift to a quieter, inward tone; emphasize *SEVENTEEN* slightly louder to convey shock.
        - Insert a long reflective pause at the paragraph containing only "¶" — allow this to be a noticeably longer beat before continuing.
        - Runner's lines should be efficient and tactile — clear, somewhat brisk delivery for functional observations; when Runner pauses mid-sentence (em dash), make it a measured, organic beat.
        - Read Holloway's line as a flute-like quality (soft, slightly breathy and musical) to distinguish the speaker: "Holloway flutes, \"Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon. Another week, perhaps two.\""

        Holloway says confidently, "Elder Heartwood will provide the framework we need — the systematic understanding of human care that we've been missing."

        Florence adds, "It will explain the patterns — connect the individual solutions we've found into a coherent whole."

        Scout bounces — agreement, excitement. I do want to share their enthusiasm.

        «Do we actually need Elder Heartwood to tell us how to do what we're already doing?» I think, sitting here and looking around at the plants who've been helping me, remembering everything we've figured out together…

        The thought feels almost disloyal. The plants have so much faith in Elder Heartwood's wisdom. They journeyed three territories to present the question — they've been waiting weeks for the response; they're counting on this.

        ¶

        And maybe Elder Heartwood *WILL* have useful insights — ancient wisdom, vast perspective, understanding that connects everything.

        But also… we've been learning the real answers every day through trial and error and by paying attention to each other: the muscle-recovery paste Remedy refined based on my feedback; Runner's growing understanding of boundaries; Holloway asking what I need instead of scheduling what the manual recommends; Velvet's deepening observations; Scout's companionship — those are real, those are working.

        Holloway continues, "When the response comes — we'll finally understand how to properly care for you, Kira. The uncertainty will resolve."

        Everyone seems so sure — so hopeful. I don't want to undermine that. They've worked hard, they care deeply, they've been waiting for this answer.

        But I'm also starting to realize we might not need it the way they think we do.

        I say carefully, "I'm sure it will be helpful." Which is probably true — even if it's not the answer they're hoping for, Elder Heartwood's perspective might offer something useful, maybe.

        Scout curls up next to me, content. Velvet comments, "The evening light is particularly good today." Runner asks, "Can we check the ventilation system tomorrow? There's a section that might need repair."

        This is my life now — daily maintenance with plant companions who are learning to care for me while I learn to work with them. We're not waiting for the real answer to arrive — we're already living it.

        But tomorrow, or next week, or whenever Elder Heartwood's response comes, I'll find out if the plants can see that too.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, observant, quietly reflective — steady pacing with deliberate small pauses and one clearly marked long reflective pause.

        - Read "Holloway says confidently, "Elder Heartwood will provide the framework we need — the systematic understanding of human care that we've been missing."" with a flute-like, breathy quality for Holloway to distinguish the voice.
        - Read Florence's line slightly more grounded and sure; keep the line distinct and on its own breath: "Florence adds, "It will explain the patterns — connect the individual solutions we've found into a coherent whole.""
        - For action lines like "Scout bounces — agreement, excitement." use a small, bright lift on "Scout" and a quick, pleased cadence on the second half.
        - Deliver inner thought paragraphs marked with double angle quotes («...») quieter and more inward: let the lines sit as private reflection.
        - Pause at the paragraph containing only "¶" for a clear, longer reflective beat before continuing narration.
        - When reading the list of concrete examples (Remedy, Runner, Holloway, Velvet, Scout), use a measured, appreciative tone — slightly proud, steady pacing; link those items with gentle commas and an em dash before the concluding clause.
        - Closing cadence: Soft landing; warm fall, lingering last syllable, cozy pause.

    "Yes. Every three days, perhaps. Or more often if—" Runner's vine brushes the mechanism again—"—if the smooth surface inside starts feeling rough. I'll know."

    And just like that, we've identified a problem and created a solution. No committees, no scheduled review periods, no waiting for proper procedures. Just: here's the issue, here's the fix, let's implement it.

    This is what the journey taught us—trust each other, adapt quickly, solve problems as they arise.

    I tell Runner, "I should tell Holloway about the new maintenance schedule," looking around for a fruiting body.

    There isn't one. I blink.

    I ask, "Holloway?"

    There's nothing — no fruiting body sprouting nearby, no fluting voice announcing they're already here.

    I actually have to go _find_ Holloway. That's… new.

    Runner's vines ripple with what might be amusement.

    Runner says, "Holloway is in the supply room — organizing — they do that when stressed."

    I head toward the supply room, Scout bouncing along. Sure enough, there's Holloway, surrounded by carefully categorized nutrient compounds.

    Holloway flutes, "Oh! I wasn't — I mean, I could have fruited near the filter if you needed — I was organizing supply records. For documentation purposes."

    I say, "It's fine."

    I add, "Just updating you on the maintenance rotation. Also, it's kind of nice to find you somewhere for once instead of you being everywhere already."

    Holloway makes a sound I can't quite interpret.

    Holloway flutes, "I'll… note that preference. Per Section 3.2 — that's actually nice. To hear."

    Did Holloway just… I file that away. Something's different, but I can't quite name it yet.

    Buddy says, "Kira — we're actually pretty good at this, aren't we?"

    I say, "Yeah. We kind of are."

    Buddy says, "I was never supposed to be a maintenance AI — but I like figuring things out with you. Is that weird?"

    I say, "Not weird at all, Buddy."

    Buddy's been different lately — less lecturing, more… wondering. Asking questions instead of providing answers. I like this Buddy better.

    Back in the common area, Remedy is waiting with the muscle recovery treatment. It's a thick paste that smells earthy but not unpleasant.

    Remedy says, "Apply to sore muscles — the compounds will absorb through your skin, reduce inflammation, promote healing."

    I say, "Thanks, Remedy."

    Remedy says, "I've been refining the formula based on your previous feedback — less tingling, more warmth. Does that align with your preferences?"

    Remedy is asking about my preferences. Adjusting the medicine based on what I've said works for me.

    I say, "Yeah, that sounds perfect."

    I apply the paste to my calves. It tingles a bit — warm tingling, not alarming. Remedy's formulations have gotten so much better.

    I ask, "How's your boundary situation?"

    Remedy's form shifts — discomfort, maybe.

    Remedy says, "Still unclear — I've been spreading less, trying to maintain more discrete edges — but it feels… artificial. Like I'm constraining something fundamental."

    I ask, "Is that bad?"

    Remedy says, "I don't know — that's the problem: I don't know what's me making a choice versus me fighting my own nature — but I appreciate you asking."

    We've been having these conversations more. Not solving Remedy's existential crisis — I don't think that's solvable — but acknowledging it. Making space for the uncertainty.

    The afternoon is maintenance tasks and small improvements. Scout and I reinforce a weak section of wall. Velvet reports that one of the environmental control systems needs adjustment. Florence stops by—wheeled in by one of the mobile platforms, carrying Elder Twist's pot—to discuss resource allocation for next month.

    It's all very… domestic—routine, the kind of daily work that makes a place livable.

    At one point Scout returns from circling the perimeter—something they've started doing regularly—and bounces differently. Agitated. Not the happy bounce or the discovery bounce, something tighter. They circle the common area twice, then settle near the eastern wall, watching.

    I ask, "What's wrong, Scout?"

    But Scout just bounces once—uncertain—and keeps watching. I don't know how to read this bounce yet. Something's bothering them, but I can't understand what.

    Velvet observes quietly, "Scout's been doing that for a few days—checking the boundaries. Coming back… tense."

    I file it away to think about later. Maybe Scout just needs more exploration time.

    We're good at it now—that realization hits me as I'm helping Runner organize the supply storage. We're actually good at this. The plants understand my needs better, I understand their frameworks, and we've built a functional rhythm.

    «And I'm… happy?»

    I stop what I'm doing, caught off guard by the feeling. When did that happen? I catch myself humming—actually humming—while sorting nutrient packets.

    I say quietly, "Buddy—how long has it been since I asked you about rescue timelines?"

    Buddy says, "Seventeen days. I noticed you stopped checking. I wasn't sure if I should mention it."

    «I haven't thought about rescue in *SEVENTEEN* days?»

    «That's… huh. That's actually kind of huge.»

    I say slowly, "Runner—have you noticed things are working better?"

    Runner agrees immediately, "Yes—cooperation is smoother. Communication clearer. We're learning your patterns, you're learning—this one has a crack. Tiny. Can barely feel it. Anyway—learning ours."

    Runner's vines wrap gently around a storage container, organizing it precisely by some texture-based logic I don't quite follow.

    Small adjustments that compound—that's exactly what it feels like.

    That evening, gathered in the common area, Holloway brings up what's on everyone's mind.

    Holloway flutes, "Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon. Another week, perhaps two."

    There's a collective sense of anticipation—the plants are hopeful, excited even.

    Holloway says confidently, "Elder Heartwood will provide the framework we need — the systematic understanding of human care that we've been missing."

    Florence adds, "It will explain the patterns — connect the individual solutions we've found into a coherent whole."

    Scout bounces — agreement, excitement. I do want to share their enthusiasm.

    «Do we actually need Elder Heartwood to tell us how to do what we're already doing?» I think, sitting here and looking around at the plants who've been helping me, remembering everything we've figured out together…

    The thought feels almost disloyal. The plants have so much faith in Elder Heartwood's wisdom. They journeyed three territories to present the question — they've been waiting weeks for the response; they're counting on this.

    And maybe Elder Heartwood *WILL* have useful insights — ancient wisdom, vast perspective, understanding that connects everything.

    But also… we've been learning the real answers every day through trial and error and by paying attention to each other: the muscle-recovery paste Remedy refined based on my feedback; Runner's growing understanding of boundaries; Holloway asking what I need instead of scheduling what the manual recommends; Velvet's deepening observations; Scout's companionship — those are real, those are working.

    Holloway continues, "When the response comes — we'll finally understand how to properly care for you, Kira. The uncertainty will resolve."

    Everyone seems so sure — so hopeful. I don't want to undermine that. They've worked hard, they care deeply, they've been waiting for this answer.

    But I'm also starting to realize we might not need it the way they think we do.

    I say carefully, "I'm sure it will be helpful." Which is probably true — even if it's not the answer they're hoping for, Elder Heartwood's perspective might offer something useful, maybe.

    Scout curls up next to me, content. Velvet comments, "The evening light is particularly good today." Runner asks, "Can we check the ventilation system tomorrow? There's a section that might need repair."

    This is my life now — daily maintenance with plant companions who are learning to care for me while I learn to work with them. We're not waiting for the real answer to arrive — we're already living it.

    But tomorrow, or next week, or whenever Elder Heartwood's response comes, I'll find out if the plants can see that too.

      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>
          Summary of approach
          - I compared the new passage against the prior open-promises list and noted which items were explicitly enacted, which remained active, and which new narrative setups the passage introduced.
          - I treated concrete, enacted changes in the facility as either fulfilling (paid off) previously-open promises or as new, firm story commitments (e.g., an explicitly adopted maintenance schedule). Soft character developments and questions about the future are recorded as tentative new promises.

          Which prior promises were paid off here?
          - Several ongoing, near-term operational or character-growth threads from the open list are shown in action in this scene (daily wellness checks, Scout sleeping in Kira's room and stronger nonverbal communication, Buddy shifting from lecturing to asking, Kira's increasing confidence, and the travel/return having been completed), so I mark those as fulfilled because the passage explicitly shows them.

          Which prior promises stay open?
          - Big-picture survival threads (bio-samples, life-support power, power drain from cooler, stranded-on-planet stakes, rescue timing, long-term food safety, Elder Heartwood's forthcoming guidance and its timescale/impact, plant governance/network questions, Remedy's 6–8 hour treatment window, robot–plant integration, etc.) are not resolved in this passage and remain relevant. The passage actually reinforces many of these as active constraints/concerns.

          Which promises are newly introduced here?
          - The passage sets up several new, concrete operational practices (a 3-day filter maintenance rotation; supply reorganization; ongoing, customized Remedy treatments) and some softer arcs that can drive future scenes (Remedy struggling with identity/boundary issues; the community’s gradual learning possibly reducing reliance on Elder Heartwood; Buddy’s social-learning shift). I mark the latter as tentative and the explicit operational changes as firm where the characters agree to them on-screen.

          Why I did not mark many things as lapsed
          - Few earlier promises are contradicted or rendered moot by this passage. Most unresolved items remain plausibly active. The only clear change was that the travel arc has been completed and daily protocols are in place and being practiced, so those timeline/travel promises are treated as fulfilled rather than lapsed.
        </reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_RETURN_SIX_DAYS">Previous estimate that the return/home segment would take about six more days — the travel has completed and the scene shows Kira two weeks back at the facility (return accomplished).</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_TOTAL_15_DAYS">Prior stated travel timeline of ~15 days total — the overall journey/return is in the past and the facility time is explicitly described, so the travel timeline has been realized/closed out.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_HEALTH_STATUS_CHECKS">Holloway conducts the morning wellness check and follows an adapted (less bureaucratic) routine — the recurring wellness-check protocol is enacted in this passage.</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_COMMUNICATION_PROGRESS">Scout is now sleeping in Kira's room, shows nuanced bounces and companionship, and Kira reads subtle differences — concrete evidence of continued progress in nonverbal/companion communication.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_SOCIAL_LEARNING_PROGRESS">Buddy has shifted from purely analytic/lecturing behavior to asking, joking, and noticing social cues (e.g., wondering if Scout dreams, noticing Kira stopped checking rescue timelines) — a clear step forward in Buddy's social learning.</promise>
          <promise id="KIRA_TRAVELER_CONFIDENCE_GROWTH">Kira displays increased competence, domestic routines, humming while working, and explicit recognition that they and the plants are good at routine maintenance — visible payoff of the confidence-growth arc.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_SEVEN_TERRITORIES_ROUTE_DETAILS">The multi-territory route that structured the journey is now a completed arc (Kira is back at the facility), so this route-as-structural-arc has been realized in the story.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>I extracted only durable, story-relevant changes or developments that will matter for future continuity (character relationships/roles, behavioral changes, resource/maintenance rules, and timeline markers). I omitted transient details (meals, momentary actions) and things already captured in the summary. None of the facts in this passage contradict prior established facts; where timescales differ (Elder Heartwood response estimate of "a week or two" vs earlier multi-week norms) this passage presents a revised/local expectation rather than a direct contradiction, and is consistent with the previously established possibility that Elder Heartwood can expedite critical cases.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TWO_WEEKS_BACK_AT_FACILITY">Kira has been back at the plant facility for two weeks (a recent, sustained period at the facility).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_SLEEPS_IN_KIRA_QUARTERS">Scout has begun sleeping in Kira's room, curling in the corner as a companion presence rather than an assigned guard.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_BECOME_LESS_BUREAUCRATIC">Holloway's wellness checks have shifted from rigid protocol-driven scheduling to asking Kira for her preferences and offering options (more human-responsive care).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_WAIT_FOR_PERMISSION_BEFORE_TOUCHING">Runner now pauses and waits for Kira's permission before initiating tactile contact, indicating developing boundary-awareness and consent practices.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_WATER_FILTER_MAINTENANCE_ROTATION_ESTABLISHED">The plant collective implemented a maintenance rotation to check the water filter every three days after debris was found in the intake.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_REFINED_MUSCLE_RECOVERY_PASTE">Remedy prepared and refined a muscle-recovery topical paste (less tingling, more warming), adjusting formulations based on Kira's feedback.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_PERSONALITY_SOCIAL_SHIFT">Buddy's behavior has shifted further toward social curiosity and light humor (more joking, asking speculative questions, and expressing enjoyment in collaborating on practical tasks).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_STOPPED_CHECKING_RESCUE_TIMELINES_17_DAYS">Kira has not checked rescue timelines for seventeen days (Buddy noticed and reported this gap in her monitoring behavior).</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_COLLECTIVE_ADAPTING_TO_HUMAN_NEEDS">Across multiple agents (Holloway, Velvet, Runner, Florence, Remedy), the plant collective is actively adjusting routines and communication to be more practically responsive and human-centered, with small daily changes compounding into smoother cooperation.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_EXPECTS_ELDER_RESPONSE_IN_1_TO_2_WEEKS">Holloway states an expectation that Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon—approximately another week to two weeks—representing the group's current anticipation/timeline for Elder Heartwood's reply.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_EXPERIENCES_INTEGRATION_AND_IMPROVED_MORALE">Kira reports increased contentment and a sense of integration into daily life at the facility (humming, genuine happiness and satisfaction with shared routines).</fact>

      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage opens with an explicit time anchor: “Two weeks back at the facility,” and then proceeds through a single day (morning routine, maintenance tasks in the afternoon, and an evening gathering). Earlier (previous passage) the characters intended to start the six-day return trip “tomorrow” and expected “six more days of walking” before reaching the facility. Combining those cues gives the full gap. Cues for passage duration: morning wellness check, daytime maintenance and repairs, and an evening meeting — the passage covers one full daytime cycle (morning → afternoon → evening). The passage ends after the evening common-area discussion, when the narrator reflects on living at the facility and awaiting Elder Heartwood’s response. Using the authoritative previous end time (2687-03-29T18:00) plus six days of return travel plus two weeks at the facility yields roughly a 20-day gap. There is a minor metadata inconsistency in the provided materials (a previous-passage summary gave ~21:30 as the previous end), but the instruction told me to use the authoritative outline end time (2687-03-29T18:00).</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-18T08:00 (approx morning)</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-18T20:00 (approx evening)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>~20 days total. Likely broken down as ~6 days for the return walk from the campsite back to the facility, then ~14 days (two weeks) living and working at the facility before the day described here. During the gap they would have traveled home, settled in, performed onboarding/cleanup, and iteratively refined routines and treatments.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Six days to return from the campsite fits the earlier passage’s stated travel time, and two weeks at the facility is a reasonable amount of time for the plants and the narrator to iterate on treatments, adjust maintenance schedules, and develop smoother cooperation. The single-day structure (morning → afternoon tasks → evening meeting) is internally consistent. The only small note is the provided previous-passage summary timestamp (~21:30) differs from the authoritative outline end (18:00); using the outline time and the narrative travel + two-week interval yields the 20-day gap described above, which fits the events shown.</plausibility>

"Entered" marks characters who appear in this passage but were not listed as present at the end of the previous passage (so they arrive during this scene).

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage is a domestic update two weeks after Kira returned to the facility. Key additions: the plants and facility routines have adapted into effective, consent-based caregiving; Buddy's behavior has shifted from prescriptive to curious and collaborative; concrete maintenance improvements (Runner fixed the filtration intake and set a three-day check rotation); Remedy refined the muscle-recovery treatment and is grappling with boundary/identity issues; Kira has stopped checking rescue timelines (17 days since she last asked); the group still expects Elder Heartwood's formal response in ~1–2 weeks but Kira recognizes they've already developed practical care practices. I removed the now-moot detail about retracing the route with a remaining ~6 days (they are back at the facility and two weeks have passed) and consolidated items about Buddy/Elder Heartwood engagement to reflect current behavior and relevance. Outstanding technical issues (Biological Samples, SAM, external comms/distress beacon) remain unresolved and are kept listed.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled “Biological Samples” struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; emergency protocols brought Kira’s neural link online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective (Scout, territory guides, cooperative spheres, Central Coordination) found and sheltered Kira; the crashed shuttle was used as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s injured leg and cleared her medically within a week; Remedy has continued refining treatments.
          - Kira formally petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove and received inter-territorial travel approval; Buddy and Scout accompanied her.
          - Kira traveled nine days through three territories with successive guides (including Leafwhisper/Rootwalker; Streamwalker/Brightbloom; Oakshade/Mossmantle) and was presented at Elder Heartwood’s grounds.
          - At the presenting ground Oakshade asked how to care for a human and bridge incompatible frameworks; Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt and will deliberate on a seasonal timescale; delegates advised Kira to return home while it considers the question.
          - Oakshade and Mossmantle explained Elder Heartwood’s consultation process: reframing questions to system patterns and offering multi-scale guidance; Buddy began studying that framework.
          - Kira has grown more confident and resilient; Scout and Kira formed a cooperative companion relationship.
          - Kira has been back at the facility for two weeks and a domestic routine has formed between her and the plant collective.
          - The plant collective has adapted caregiving practices: sleeping in Kira’s space as companions, asking consent (Holloway now asks before scheduling treatments), respecting permission (Runner pauses before touching), and adjusting observations to Kira’s preferences.
          - Practical maintenance improvements: Runner cleared debris from the water-filtration intake and proposed a three-day filter-check rotation; small, rapid problem-solving has become common.
          - Remedy refined a muscle-recovery paste based on Kira’s feedback; Remedy is simultaneously struggling with its sense of boundaries and whether constraint conflicts with its nature.
          - Buddy’s behavior has softened—more curious and collaborative, making jokes and asking questions—and noted Kira hasn’t checked rescue timelines in 17 days.
          - The collective expects Elder Heartwood’s formal response in roughly one to two weeks; plants are hopeful, but Kira recognizes the group has already developed effective, practical care routines.
          - Outstanding unresolved issues: active Biological Samples container, SAM still offline, external communications/distress beacon still broken, and Elder Heartwood’s full guidance still pending.

        <reasoning>
          POV feelings — Kira is unexpectedly domestic and quietly contented. After weeks of crisis, travel, and intense onboarding, she notices small rhythms (moss bed, morning checks, shared chores) and feels a grounded happiness—relief mixed with pride—because the plant collective has shifted from rigid protocol to responsive cooperation and because she can now contribute in practical ways. There's still a low, anticipatory edge about Elder Heartwood's pending reply, but it sits behind the calmer foreground of daily competence.

          Reader experience — The reader is likely to feel warmth, relief, and satisfaction. Tension from earlier survival arcs is eased; instead of high-stakes suspense the passage delivers domestic comfort, incremental wins (fixing a filter), and gentle character moments. At the same time there is a subtle, lingering unease or curiosity about the upcoming Elder Heartwood response and Kira's internal question about whether they actually need that external authority.

          Emotional beats — The passage contains multiple overlapping beats rather than one monolithic tone: (1) warm belonging/intimacy and contentment; (2) quiet competence and collaborative pride when problems are solved; (3) restrained anticipation/unease about the larger unresolved question (Elder Heartwood). The dominant tone is settled, domestic hope mixed with thoughtful reflection rather than high drama.

          Comparison to story so far — This continues and consolidates the arc already visible: Kira has moved from terrified survivor to trusted, competent traveler and now to an integrated, domesticated member of the plant facility. The plants' behavioral shifts (less bureaucratic, more attentive) are consistent with earlier development but are now normalized and operational—what was once novel contact is becoming practical partnership.

          Surprises — There are no radical revelations or plot reversals; the few surprises are subtle: the collective's bureaucratic looseness and practical responsiveness are now entrenched (Holloway asking rather than scheduling), which reverses their earlier rigid behavior. Buddy's increasing informality and reflective questions continue a previously established trend rather than upend expectations.

          Character change — Several small but meaningful developments occur: Kira's internal identity shifts toward domestic belonging and acceptance of a new life rhythm; Buddy becomes more collaborative and curious (less directive AI); Runner demonstrates practical maintenance skill and respect for human boundaries; Remedy shows explicit self-awareness/vulnerability about changing its behavior and form. These are continuations of prior growth rather than abrupt transformations.
        </reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="intimacy, joy">Warm belonging and domestic contentment: Kira notices the facility has become 'lived-in' and feels unexpectedly happy—moss bed mornings, Scout sleeping in her room, Velvet's tailored observations. The POV experiences calm gratitude and intimacy; the reader feels comforted and relieved after the story's earlier high-tension beats.</beat>
          <beat tags="determination, hope">Quiet competence and collaborative pride when practical problems are solved (the filtration intake clog). The group responds quickly and iteratively—Runner extracts debris, they add a maintenance rotation. Kira feels capable and part of a functioning team; the reader experiences satisfaction and an upbeat sense that growth is productive.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, unease">Anticipatory tension about Elder Heartwood’s upcoming response and an internal conflict: Kira admires the plants' faith in Elder Heartwood but begins to wonder whether they already have the practical answers. The POV juggles hope for ancient wisdom with a nascent belief in locally grown solutions; the reader feels curious and slightly unsettled about which source will ultimately anchor care.</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="character, reversal">The plant collective’s operational shift from strict protocol to responsive partnership. Holloway now asks Kira what she needs instead of unilaterally scheduling treatment; Runner waits for permission before touching; maintenance is solved ad hoc rather than routed through committee. This reverses the earlier, more bureaucratic behavior and signals the species adapting relationally rather than merely following manuals.</surprise>
        </surprises>
        <character-development>
          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="identity-shift">Moves further from survival-and-quest mode into a settled domestic identity: she recognizes competence, ceases obsessively checking rescue timelines (17 days without thinking about it), hums while working, and experiences genuine happiness and belonging. This is an identity-shift and reinforcement of trust in the collective.</development>
          <development character="Buddy" tag="trust-built">Continues emotional maturation: less lecturing, more joking and reflective questioning (asks whether plants dream, mentions appreciation for figuring things out together, notices Kira stopped checking rescue timelines). Buddy shifts from utility/comic relief toward engaged partner.</development>
          <development character="Runner" tag="skill-learned">Shows practical skill-learning and social refinement: performs effective maintenance (locates and extracts filter debris), remembers priorities, and respects human boundary cues (pauses for permission). This is concrete competence and social attunement.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="relationship-shift">Shifts relational stance: moves from rigidly following wellness protocol to asking Kira what she wants and deferring to her agency, signaling increased sensitivity to individual needs rather than only procedural correctness.</development>
          <development character="Remedy" tag="vulnerability-shown">Expresses explicit vulnerability about self-modification and boundary work—shares discomfort about constraining its nature and appreciates Kira's attention. This reveals an inward-facing, existential fragility rather than just clinical function.</development>
          <development character="Scout &amp; Velvet (collective minor entry)" tag="trust-built">Scout doubles down on companion behavior (sleeping in Kira's room, steady presence) and Velvet deepens observational nuance (reading 'working tired' vs generic comment), reinforcing trust and mutual attunement between species.</development>

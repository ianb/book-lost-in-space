      <must-convey>
        Back at facility, THRIVING. The journey changed everything—better cooperation, genuine friendship. Kira realizes she's... happy? Wellness checks still charming, mushroom paste still terrible. Still waiting for Elder Heartwood but the waiting doesn't feel urgent anymore.
      </must-convey>
      <hook-questions>
        Will Elder Heartwood's response solve everything? What have they actually learned during the journey and wait?
      </hook-questions>
      <launching-situation>
        Couple weeks after returning from the journey to Elder Heartwood. Settled back into facility routine. Still waiting for the response.
      </launching-situation>
      <location-impression>
        Facility feels more like home now. Familiar routines, comfortable rhythms. The journey changed how Kira sees this place.
      </location-impression>
      <story-goal>
        Show that they're actually succeeding at cooperation and care without Elder Heartwood's answer. Set up the irony that they already have what they need while waiting for external validation.
      </story-goal>
      <pov-inner-life>
        Kira genuinely happy—when did that happen? The journey was supposed to be the hard part, but she misses it. These routines feel like HOME. Still waiting for Elder Heartwood's response but realizes she's stopped checking the days. "Mav never stayed anywhere long enough for this feeling."

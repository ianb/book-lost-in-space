  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>Kira is two weeks back at the facility and the narrative ends in the facility's common area in the evening. Specific physical facts: Kira sleeps on a moss bed in her room that Velvet maintains (soft, controlled humidity); Scout sleeps in Kira's room, curled in the corner and now accompanies her throughout the day. Buddy is an internal presence and is currently quiet. Multiple plant-entities are physically present in the facility/common area (Velvet on the wall, Runner with vines, Holloway with fruiting bodies, Remedy as a shifting form, Florence arriving with Elder Twist's pot on a mobile platform). Earlier that day Runner inspected and cleared the water filtration intake, extracting a clump of plant matter and mineral deposits; a maintenance schedule change was made to check filters every three days. Kira applied Remedy's refined muscle-recovery paste to her calves (warm tingling). Kira and Scout reinforced a weak section of wall earlier; Velvet has indicated an environmental-control system needs adjustment; Runner flagged a section of ventilation that may need repair tomorrow. Supply storage was reorganized and a storage container is being organized. The facility functions in a more domestic, lived-in way; daily maintenance routines are active. Elder Heartwood’s response still has not arrived but is expected in about one to two weeks. Time of day at the end is evening/late afternoon with notable evening light.</reasoning>
    <state>Kira is in the facility common area in the evening, Scout curled beside her; her moss bed in her room is maintained by Velvet (proper humidity). Velvet, Runner, Holloway, Remedy, Florence (with Elder Twist’s pot), and other plant staff are present and active. The water filtration intake has just been cleared of a debris/mineral clump and a three-day filter-check rotation has been scheduled. Kira has applied Remedy’s muscle-recovery paste to her calves. A previously weak wall section has been reinforced; an environmental-control system needs adjustment and a ventilation section is flagged for repair tomorrow. Supplies have been reorganized. Buddy remains an internal, quiet presence. Elder Heartwood’s response is still pending (estimated one–two weeks).</state>
  </physical-reality>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage is a domestic, “after” scene: Kira is back at the facility two weeks after the journey, routines have settled, and incremental problem-solving and learning are emphasized. It pays off some operational/temporal setups from the previous passage (they completed the trip and the short-termed schedule, and Kira’s competence visibly advanced), updates other threads (Elder Heartwood's response timeline tightened to ~1–2 weeks), and introduces small but potentially important new local promises about maintenance rhythms, Remedy's adaptation, and emerging domestic governance/tensions among plant actors. I treated as "fulfilled" only those items that were explicitly resolved or clearly executed in this passage and that were listed among the previous OPEN_PROMISES. I treated as "open/carry forward" those earlier threads that remain unresolved or were merely updated, plus the new, local promises introduced here. Nothing in the passage explicitly abandons major earlier plotlines, so I did not mark large threads as lapsed/abandoned.</reasoning>

  </narrative-promises>
  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage mainly documents durable shifts in plant–human interaction and some ongoing character states that will affect future scenes: plants (especially Holloway, Velvet, Runner, Remedy) are moving from rigid HR-style protocols toward more flexible, individualized care and practical, on-the-spot problem-solving; Runner is explicitly learning and respecting bodily boundaries; Remedy is experiencing an ongoing identity/boundary tension about changing its spreading behavior; Velvet's sensory observations are becoming more specific; and the group has instantiated a faster maintenance/decision rhythm (e.g., fix-now rotations). These are continuity-relevant because they change how decisions, care, and daily problems will be resolved later (less procedural delay, more local discretion), and they alter relationships and expectations between Kira and the plant community. The only clear contradiction with the existing fact set is a timing discrepancy about when Elder Heartwood's response is expected: this passage reports ~1–2 weeks; an earlier established fact records Buddy's estimate of 55–83 days remaining. I do not flag other narrative developments as conflicts because they represent changes or local estimates rather than outright contradictions of established, immutable facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_RELAXED_PROTOCOLS">Holloway has shifted from enforcing strict protocol-driven scheduling to exercising discretion—asking Kira what care she prefers instead of automatically scheduling treatments per the manual.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_RESPECTS_PHYSICAL_BOUNDARIES">Runner now pauses and waits for explicit permission before initiating tactile contact with Kira, indicating learned respect for human personal boundaries.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PLANTS_INDIVIDUALIZED_CARE_AND_FAST_ADAPTATION">The plant community (exemplified by Holloway, Velvet, Runner, Remedy) is adopting more flexible, individualized care and a faster, pragmatic maintenance/decision rhythm—solving technical problems directly without convening formal committees or following only prewritten procedures.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_BOUNDARY_IDENTITY_CONFLICT">Remedy is experiencing an internal conflict about constraining its natural 'spreading' behavior to maintain discrete edges; it is uncertain whether the change is a self-chosen adaptation or a forced constraint, and this is an ongoing emotional/identity issue.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_INCREASED_OBSERVATIONAL_SPECIFICITY">Velvet's sensory/reporting capability has become more specific and nuanced—its comments are shifting from simple literal observations to more discriminating, context-aware remarks about Kira's state.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts>
      <conflict id="TIMING_CONFLICT_ELDER_RESPONSE" with-fact="BUDDY_REPORTED_REMAINING_DAYS_55_83">This passage reports Holloway's expectation that Elder Heartwood's response will arrive 'another week, perhaps two' (≈7–14 days). Previously, Buddy explicitly reported the remaining wait as approximately 55–83 days. These two estimates are inconsistent.</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage opens with an explicit marker: "Two weeks back at the facility," and then immediately shows a morning scene (Buddy's "morning wellness check!" and waking up on the moss bed). Later in the passage the narrator moves through a full day of activity (breakfast, maintenance tasks, afternoon repairs, evening group meeting) and it closes in the evening when the group discusses Elder Heartwood's impending response. The previous passage ended at an evening campsite (~20:00) the night before the group planned to start the return trip home. From that point the implied timeline is: start return trip the next day, ~six days walking back through familiar territories (as stated in the previous passage), arrival at the facility, then two weeks spent at the facility prior to this opening morning. That yields roughly 6–7 days travel + 14 days at the facility = ~20–21 days (≈ three weeks) elapsed between the nighttime scene that closed the previous passage and the morning that opens this passage. The passage itself covers a single facility day from morning to evening (several hours). The gap content (return walk, arrival, acclimation and progressive refinements to care and routines) is consistent with the scenes described here.</reasoning>
    <starts>Two weeks after being back at the facility — morning (~08:00), roughly 21 days after the previous passage ended</starts>
    <ends>That evening (~20:00) of the same day (roughly 21 days after the previous passage ended)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About three weeks (~20–21 days). Breakdown: the previous passage ends at campsite evening; the group leaves the next day and completes the return walk over ~6 days, then the narrator spends two weeks at the facility before the scene that opens this passage. During that gap they travelled home, re-entered facility life, and spent ~14 days integrating changes: maintenance routines, medicine refinements, boundary and communication adjustments, and learning to cooperate with the plant staff.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Two weeks of concentrated, daily interaction after a multi-day return trip is enough time for the kinds of incremental improvements described (refined treatments, changed behaviors, new maintenance rotations, and clearer communication). The only minor note is a tonal shift in expectations about Elder Heartwood's response: earlier passages suggested answers could take weeks to seasons, while here plants say the response should arrive "another week, perhaps two." This inconsistency is explainable (Elder Heartwood may accelerate a response if a situation is critical or if the question has been fully presented), so it doesn't break plausibility. Overall the timing aligns with the activities and character changes shown.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters to include in PRESENT are anyone who appears or is mentioned in the passage. The passage includes Kira (narrator), Buddy, Scout, Velvet, Holloway, Runner, Remedy, Florence, and mentions Elder Twist and Elder Heartwood. ENTERED should list characters who were not present at the end of the previous passage (the provided previous-present list) but appear during this passage: Velvet, Holloway, Runner, Remedy, and Florence all appear here but were not in the previous-present list, so they 'enter' during the scene. Elder Twist is mentioned (via their pot) but is not described as arriving, so they are present/mentioned but not listed as having entered. No character is explicitly described as leaving during the passage, so EXITED is empty. The facility/setting is part of the broader world; the only available entity card that fits is the Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so it's listed as relevant.</reasoning>

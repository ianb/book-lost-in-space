  <facts>
    <reasoning>I reviewed the passage for durable, story-relevant changes (character behaviors, new routines, and procedural changes) and flagged only items that will matter later. I did not record transient details (time of day, immediate actions) or summarize information already captured in the provided summary. I flagged one clear contradiction: Holloway's expectation that Elder Heartwood will respond within "another week, perhaps two" contradicts the previously established 8–12 week response estimate and the characterization of Elder Heartwood as slow/distant in communication. Other developments are presented as behavioral or procedural changes that will affect future interactions and decisions (e.g., increased plant responsiveness, new maintenance schedule, Remedy's ongoing self-reflection).</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VELVET_MAINTAINS_MOSS_BED">Velvet is responsible for maintaining Kira's moss bed, keeping it soft and at the correct humidity.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_SCOUT_SLEEPING_IN_ROOM">Scout has begun sleeping in Kira's room, curled in the corner as a companion (presence/companionship rather than an assigned guard).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_LESS_INTRUSIVE">Buddy's behavior has become less didactic and more deferential: it still offers information and encouragement but now accepts deferral when Kira indicates 'not now'.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_WELLNESS_CHECKS_CONSULTATIVE">Holloway's morning wellness checks have shifted from strict protocol-following to a more consultative approach—asking Kira what she actually needs rather than automatically scheduling treatments.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_RUNNER_SEEKS_CONSENT_BEFORE_TOUCH">Runner's tactile interactions have changed: Runner now pauses and waits for permission before wrapping vines or making contact, indicating consent-aware behavior.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FILTER_MAINTENANCE_SCHEDULE_ESTABLISHED">A maintenance rotation was added for the water filtration system: filters should be checked/cleaned approximately every three days.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_REFINES_TREATMENTS_AND_EXPRESSES_BOUNDARY_CONCERNS">Remedy is actively refining medicinal formulations based on Kira's feedback (e.g., less tingling, more warmth) and is verbalizing discomfort about maintaining discrete boundaries versus its nature—indicating ongoing self-reflection/identity/boundary issues.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FACILITY_SOCIAL_DYNAMICS_SHIFT_TO_COLLABORATIVE">The facility's social and operational dynamics have shifted from formal/bureaucratic procedures to more domestic, pragmatic, collaborative problem-solving between Kira and the plant collective (faster decision-making, on-the-spot fixes, and iterative adjustments based on feedback).</fact>

    <conflicts>
      <conflict id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_TIMING_CONFLICT" with-fact="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_ESTIMATE_8_TO_12_WEEKS">Previously, Elder Heartwood's response was estimated to take roughly 8–12 weeks and the entity was described as slow/distant in communication. In this passage Holloway states 'Elder Heartwood's response should arrive soon. Another week, perhaps two,' which directly contradicts the earlier 8–12 week response estimate and the established slow-response characterization.</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>The passage opens with an explicit temporal marker: "Two weeks back at the facility," which places the narrator roughly two weeks into their stay after returning from the field. Internal time cues show a single day of activity: a morning wellness check, breakfast, daytime maintenance tasks (checking the water filter, organizing supplies), and then an evening group conversation about Elder Heartwood's impending response. Thus the passage itself spans from morning through evening of that single day. To connect to the previous passage: the prior scene ended on the evening before they started the six-day return walk home. The narrator earlier stated there would be "six more days of walking" to reach the facility; so the elapsed interval since the previous passage is the six-day return trip plus the two-week stay now described — roughly twenty days in total. Activities that plausibly filled that gap include the six-day return journey, arrival and reintegration at the facility, repeated daily maintenance tasks, iterative refinements to treatments and protocols, and gradual behavioral adjustments by facility plants (all of which are referenced as having occurred). The morning→evening progression within the passage is realistic for the described tasks. No glaring contradictions are apparent: the timing matches earlier statements (six days to return, then weeks/months of waiting for Elder Heartwood), and the scale of behavioral and procedural change described fits a multi-week period of practice and refinement.</reasoning>
    <starts>two weeks after returning to the facility, morning (~08:00) — which is ~20 days after the previous passage's night (~21:30) when accounting for the six-day return walk plus 14 days at the facility</starts>
    <ends>that evening (~20:00) of the same day (the day described as 'Two weeks back...')</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>About 20 days (approximately six days of return travel plus ~14 days living at the facility). During that gap they completed the return walk, re-established routines, iteratively improved treatments and maintenance schedules, and deepened the plants' practical responsiveness to the narrator.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The six-day return trip plus two weeks at the facility reasonably supports the described developments (improved remedies, changed interaction patterns, new maintenance rhythms). The passage's internal day (morning through evening) fits the activities listed. No timing contradictions with the prior passage's statements.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I read the passage and listed every character explicitly mentioned or present. Kira (narrator) is present throughout. Buddy and Scout are present at the start (Buddy announces the wellness check; Scout is already in the room). Holloway is conducting the morning wellness check early on, so is present near the start. Velvet is referenced early as maintaining the moss bed and then is explicitly present in the common area at breakfast, so Velvet appears. Runner "emerges from the underground access" — an explicit entrance during the scene. Remedy is present later in the common area with the muscle recovery treatment — they appear after the initial bedroom scene. Florence stops by with Elder Twist's pot — Florence appears, and Elder Twist is mentioned (the pot is carried), so Elder Twist is included. Elder Heartwood is mentioned as the expected respondent (their response should arrive soon), so Elder Heartwood is mentioned even though not physically present. No character is described as leaving the scene before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The passage refers to the facility and common areas but does not mention any of the listed entity cards (Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet is not referenced), so ENTITIES is empty.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The passage reports Kira two weeks back at the Holloway facility, recovering and adjusting to a new daily rhythm with plant companions. Important plot developments: plants have shifted from rigid protocol to responsive cooperation (Holloway asks rather than schedules), plant actors are implementing practical maintenance improvements (Runner fixed the water filter and added a three-day check rotation), Remedy refined a muscle-recovery paste based on Kira's feedback, and Buddy and other plants are learning to give space and optional guidance. Kira recognizes that the group is already developing sustainable care practices even as they still await Elder Heartwood's formal response (expected in ~1–2 weeks). I will consolidate earlier travel/timeline details (return plan, daily trek specifics) into a single note that Kira completed the journey and is back at the facility, and remove now-irrelevant specifics like the remaining days-to-return timeline. I’ll keep core facts: crash and casualties, SAM offline/Buddy active, physical journey to Elder Heartwood and question presented, plants' deliberation timeframe, Kira's recovery and two-week return, the practical cooperative changes at the facility, Remedy/Runner/Holloway behavior changes, Buddy learning to be less intrusive, Scout as a bonded companion, and Elder Heartwood's impending reply with Kira's skepticism about needing it.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - FTL shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM remains offline and emergency neural-link AI Buddy is active.
      - Holloway plant collective treated Kira, provided temporary quarters and Scout as a companion; Kira chose to travel physically to the Elder Heartwood rather than wait for rescue.
      - Kira completed a guided, multi-territory trek with plant guides (Streamwalker, Brightbloom, Leafwhisper, Rootwalker, etc.), learned plant-networked survival practices, and helped investigate local mineral and swamp anomalies.
      - Oakshade and Mossmantle presented Kira's question to Elder Heartwood about how to care for a human and bridge plant/human frameworks; Elder Heartwood acknowledged receipt and began deliberation on long timescales, citing precedent cases.
      - Kira returned to the Holloway facility and has been back for two weeks, recovering on a moss bed while reintegrating into daily life with plant companions.
      - Daily plant–human cooperation has shifted from protocol-driven to responsive: Holloway now asks Kira's preferences instead of unilaterally scheduling treatments.
      - Practical maintenance improvements implemented: Runner removed debris clogging the water filtration intake and proposed a three-day filter-check rotation; ventilation and structural repairs are being scheduled.
      - Remedy refined a topical muscle-recovery paste using Kira's feedback (less tingling, more warmth) and discusses its own boundary struggles—plants are both adapting practices and acknowledging internal uncertainty.
      - Buddy is learning to be less intrusive, offering optional information rather than constant corrections; Scout has grown into a bonded companion and now sleeps in Kira's room.
      - The facility's daily life has become functional and domestically managed through incremental adjustments that compound into reliable care routines.
      - Elder Heartwood's formal response is expected within a week or two; the plants are hopeful, but Kira realizes they may already be developing effective care practices without waiting for that verdict.
    </summary>
  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>POV state: Kira is quietly contented and steady — a domestic, earned comfort that comes from competence and reciprocal care. She notices small, concrete changes in the plants' behavior (less intrusive Buddy, Remedy asking preferences, Runner waiting for permission) and those changes prompt feelings of belonging, pragmatic pride, and cautious optimism. The prospect of Elder Heartwood's reply introduces a familiar anticipatory beat, but it's tempered by ambivalence: she both values the plants' faith in Elder Heartwood and recognizes that they've already learned effective, lived solutions. Reader experience: warm reassurance and uplift (relief that care is working), plus mild curiosity/anticipation about the incoming response. Emotional palette: multiple beats — a dominant tone of domestic belonging/acceptance layered with a quieter beat of agency/pride and a lingering anticipatory note about Elder Heartwood. Comparison to earlier pattern: this continues the story's recurring anticipation→dread→acceptance arc, but the balance has shifted: acute dread/frustration has mostly given way to practiced acceptance, belonging, and agency. The anticipation around Elder Heartwood repeats a familiar motif, but it now sits beside a stronger sense that Kira and the plants are already solving problems — the repetition is reframed as growth rather than stasis.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="belonging, acceptance">POV: Warm, domestic belonging and calm acceptance — Kira feels cared-for and part of a functioning household (moss bed, Scout sleeping in her room, Velvet's observations, Remedy/Holloway's attentive questions). Cause: repeated, thoughtful interactions and adaptive changes in plant behavior that signal real companionship rather than rote protocol. Reader: Experiences comfort and relief; the scene soothes after prior trauma and procedural friction and offers a restorative, homey beat.</beat>
      <beat tags="hope, acceptance">POV: Quiet pride and pragmatic hope — Kira recognizes that she and the plants have become competent collaborators (fixing the filter, improved treatments, shared problem-solving). Cause: concrete successes and incremental improvements (maintenance rotation, Remedy refining medicine, Runner learning boundaries). Reader: Feels uplifted and satisfied; this is an emotional payoff — small victories that convert earlier helplessness into agency and competence.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, dread">POV: Cautious anticipation mixed with ambivalence — the group awaits Elder Heartwood's response with hope, but Kira wonders whether they already possess the practical answers and feels a quiet tension about relying on external authority. Cause: announcement of an imminent reply and Kira's realization that daily practice has produced working solutions. Reader: Experiences curiosity and mild unease; the scene restarts the familiar anticipation motif but with less panic and more thoughtful doubt about dependency on the elder's verdict.</beat>

  </emotional-journey>
  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I reviewed each previously open promise and checked whether the current passage (Kira two weeks back at the facility) either advances, resolves, contradicts, or abandons that setup. The passage mostly shows the immediate practical consequences of the journey: Kira is back, plant companions and facility systems have adjusted to her needs, and day-to-day maintenance and medical routines are being refined collaboratively. Elder Heartwood's answer remains pending; plants expect it soon, but it hasn't arrived. Because the text explicitly describes completed return and an ongoing, stable routine, I treated the previously-introduced return-schedule promise as fulfilled. The passage also demonstrates a clear reduction in information-overload style interactions from guides and Buddy; that undermines (and so lapses) the earlier tentative expectation that guide chatter / information overload would remain a dominant pattern. Most other earlier promises (crash mysteries, shuttle/sam/SAM issues, long-term survival, medical time-limits, network-level questions about Elder, rescue timeline, etc.) are unchanged by this domestic interlude, so I carried them forward as open. Finally, I flagged new, narrower promises that the passage introduces: concrete maintenance practices (three-day filter rotation), on-the-ground shifts toward plant adaptation to human preferences and personalized remedies, Buddy's reduced intrusiveness, a visible compounding of small cooperative improvements, and the plants' optimistic short timetable for Elder's reply — some of these are firm local changes (explicitly set in the scene), others are tentative expectations or emerging trends.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>

      <promise id="ELDER_WILL_COMMUNICATE_LATER" tentative="true" introduced="24">When Elder Heartwood's understanding is ready, the answer will be delivered to Kira (method/timing unspecified) — still expected but not yet realized.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_PRIORITY_CRITICAL_CASES" tentative="false" introduced="25">Guides claim Elder Heartwood speeds up responses for critical matters — plants reiterate that Kira's survival is critical and will be prioritized; not yet tested.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_ANSWER_NETWORK_BENEFIT" tentative="true" introduced="25">The guidance Elder provides for cross-framework care is expected to be transferable and to benefit multiple territories/network actors, not only Kira.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANTS_ADAPTING_TO_HUMAN_PREFERENCES" tentative="false" introduced="26">New (firm): The facility's plants are explicitly adjusting behavior to Kira's needs (asking about treatments, adjusting medicine, pausing tactile contact) and this adaptation is an ongoing, operational change.</promise>
      <promise id="MAINTENANCE_ROTATION_EVERY_THREE_DAYS" tentative="false" introduced="26">New (firm): Runner and Kira establish a concrete maintenance cadence for the water filter (check/clean every three days).</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_PERSONALIZED_TREATMENT" tentative="false" introduced="26">New (firm): Remedy is actively refining medical formulations based on Kira's feedback and will continue to personalize treatments.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_COLLECTIVE_LEARNING_COMPOUNDING" tentative="true" introduced="26">New (tentative): The plants and Kira are making small adjustments that compound over time into more effective cooperative practices; an emergent expectation rather than a guaranteed trajectory.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_RESPONSE_IMMINENT_SHORT_TIMELINE" tentative="true" introduced="26">New (tentative): Facility members predict Elder Heartwood's reply within a short window ('another week, perhaps two'); this is an expressed expectation but not certain.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_LESS_INTRUSIVE" tentative="true" introduced="26">New (tentative): Buddy's habit of unsolicited teaching is easing—Buddy offers information but respects Kira's space more often; an observed behavioral trend.</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_REALIZING_INDEPENDENT_SOLUTIONS" tentative="true" introduced="26">New (tentative): Kira begins to suspect that ongoing collaborative, incremental solutions may accomplish the practical care she needs even without Elder's explicit instructions.</promise>

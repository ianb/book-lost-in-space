  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>At the end of the passage the scene has moved from the common area into individual workspaces and Kira's room. Holloway has been in the maintenance room cataloging and reorganizing supply inventories and proposing a rotating-stock method; those inventories are physically present and actively being documented. The plants who had gathered have largely dispersed to their usual positions (Florence with Elder Twist's pot, Runner near the environmental-control systems, Velvet tending the moss bed, Remedy back at the dispensary/mycelial network). No external messenger or written response remains—no new documents or devices were left. Remedy has left a newly adjusted muscle-recovery treatment in Kira's care; Velvet has actively maintained the moss bed's humidity and softness. Runner checked the environmental controls earlier and made at least cursory adjustments or inspections. The paused exterior maintenance task and flagged ventilation repair remain unresolved. It is evening; the common area is quieter and less crowded than earlier, and Kira is in her room lying on the moss bed with Scout curled beside her.</reasoning>
    <state>It is evening in the facility. The common area has emptied after the meeting; plant attendants have dispersed to their usual stations. Holloway is in the maintenance room documenting and reorganizing supply inventories and has implemented (physically present) rotating-stock organization steps. Remedy's mycelial network is present and a newly adjusted muscle-recovery treatment has been left for Kira. Velvet has maintained the moss bed (humidity and softness appropriate). Runner has inspected/checked the environmental-control systems and is stationed nearby; one ventilation section and the paused exterior drainage task remain flagged for future repair. No messenger, document, or new external authority item remains. Kira is in her personal room, lying on the moss bed with Scout curled in their corner.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage shows the group processing the Elder's unusable answer and explicitly pivoting to a locally built, iterative approach. Several risks and uncertainties that were raised in the previous passage are now realized (Elder misread the question, records mismatch, timescale mismatch), and the group acts on that information (they decide not to wait for clarification and instead pursue local adaptation). Other operational, investigatory, and long-term questions from the previous open-promises list remain unresolved and should be carried forward. I mark only those prior promises that were directly paid off in this passage as fulfilled. I do not mark as fulfilled any promise that was introduced and acted on in the same passage (none of the fulfilled items were both introduced and resolved here). No prior promise is clearly abandoned as completely irrelevant; many continue to matter, so LAPSED_PROMISES is empty.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="ELDER_MISINTERPRETATION_RISK">The risk that centuries-scale authorities would misinterpret an urgent/present human problem was realized: Elder Heartwood treated the question as historical/philosophical and produced an answer irrelevant to Kira's immediate survival.</promise>
      <promise id="RECORDS_MISMATCH_ON_VISITOR_PRESENCE">The previously-raised possibility that central/elder records might not register Kira correctly manifested—Elder Heartwood apparently did not 'see' Kira as a current visitor.</promise>
      <promise id="CLARIFICATION_REQUEST_DELAY_RISK">The cost/time risk of re-presenting the question to Elder Heartwood was confronted and effectively decided against; the plants chose not to wait additional weeks/months for clarification and instead pivoted to local action.</promise>
      <promise id="NEW_PROMISE_SPIRAL_TYPES_TIME_PERCEPTION__POTENTIAL_EFFECTS">The speculative risk about spiral/elder timescale perception (authorities operating on timescales that make humans 'noise') was demonstrated by Elder Heartwood's centuries-scale framing.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_FACE_TO_FACE_COMMUNICATION_OUTCOME__IMPLEMENTATION_FOLLOWUP">The open question of whether the group would attempt clarification or change tactics after receiving the Elder's response was resolved: they changed tactics—shifting to local, iterative cooperation rather than further appeals to the Elder.</promise>
      <promise id="SHIFT_TO_LOCAL_ADAPTATION_PROMISE">The previously-identified possibility that the group might explicitly pivot to local iterative problem-solving was acted on: the collective commits to tracking, adapting, and validating care locally rather than waiting on external authority.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only new, story-relevant facts that extend beyond the provided summary and matter for future continuity (character tendencies, decisions that change future behavior, or revealed deceptions). I did not repeat details already in the summary (room, who was present, that Holloway reorganized supplies, timing, that Remedy left an adjusted treatment, that Velvet maintained the moss bed, Scout curled up, etc.). I flagged state changes (decisions, admissions, emotional shifts) with CHANGE_ prefixes. No lines in this passage directly contradict the previously established facts, so no conflicts were recorded.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="HOLLOWAY_STRESS_ORDERING">When Holloway is stressed they cope by creating order through categorization and inventory—organizing supplies is a characteristic stress-response behavior.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_EMOTIONAL_SHIFT">Holloway displays an emotional shift—unfamiliar bitterness, uncertainty, and loss of confidence in external authorities (a departure from their usual measured, bureaucratic demeanor).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_ADMITTED_FABRICATION">Florence admits she fabricated 'Elder Twist' wisdom—presenting her own guidance under the authority's voice to make it more acceptable.</fact>
      <fact id="PLANTS_VALIDATE_BY_OUTCOME">At least some plant-members (Velvet, Remedy, others) accept that positive, observable outcomes (Kira's survival and improved health) can serve as valid confirmation/authority for their practices rather than needing Elder Heartwood's approval.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GROUP_DECISION_SELF_RELIANCE">The plant community and Kira collectively decide to stop waiting for Elder Heartwood and to continue iteratively learning and validating their care/cooperation through attention, adaptation, and outcome-tracking (an explicit shift toward self-reliant, experiential governance/validation).</fact>
      <fact id="SCOUT_CONNECTIVE_REINFORCEMENT">Scout reinforces group cohesion through tactile/close physical contact (pressing/bouncing between members) as an active, repeated behavior to connect and reassure the group.</fact>

  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Temporal cues in the text: the passage opens with "The rest of the day is very quiet" and directly follows the messenger's departure, which the previous passage placed in the late morning (~11:00). The characters carry on through daytime activities (Holloway organizing supplies, a lengthy conversation), then explicitly "gather everyone in the common area that evening," followed by dispersal and a later return to the protagonist's room where they lie down for the night. 

      How much time passes during the passage: several hours — from shortly after the late-morning messenger scene through the afternoon, into an evening meeting, and ending at night when everyone has dispersed. 

      When the passage ends: after evening dispersal and the protagonist goes to bed (nighttime). 

      Gap from previous passage: essentially immediate. The previous passage ended late morning (~11:00) when the messenger left; this passage begins right after plants disperse and the protagonist finds Holloway in the maintenance room. That implies minutes to at most an hour passed between the end of the previous passage and the start of this one. 

      Plausibility: The timeline is plausible. The characters' actions (tidying supplies, a long reflective conversation, convening an evening meeting, small care adjustments, and returning to bed) reasonably fill the span of a day into night. Minor tasks mentioned (e.g., Remedy leaving a modified treatment, Runner checking controls) are short, routine actions that could fit within the same day. No major temporal contradictions appear.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>11:15</starts>
    <ends>21:30</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>Essentially none — immediate continuation. Roughly 0–30 minutes after the previous passage ended (~11:00); the plants disperse and the protagonist finds Holloway shortly thereafter.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The events (daytime conversation, planning, an evening group meeting, dispersal, and returning to bed) reasonably occupy the span from late morning through evening/night. Small procedural tasks referenced could feasibly be done within that timeframe.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>I list characters who are mentioned or appear in the passage. Present: characters explicitly appearing or mentioned (Kira is the narrator; Holloway, Scout, Florence, Elder Twist, Elder Heartwood, Remedy, Runner, and Velvet all appear or are named). Entered: no new characters arrive during this passage—everyone named was already part of the group at the start. Exited: the passage states that everyone disperses and later only Kira and Scout return to Kira’s room, so the other previously-present characters leave during the scene (Buddy, Holloway, Florence, Elder Twist, Elder Heartwood, Remedy, Runner, Velvet). No specific location/organization from the available entity list is referenced, so entities is empty.</reasoning>

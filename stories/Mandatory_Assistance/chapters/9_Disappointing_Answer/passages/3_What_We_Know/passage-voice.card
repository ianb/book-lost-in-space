        The rest of the day is very quiet. After the messenger leaves, the plants disperse slowly—no one quite knows what to do with themselves; the answer they'd been building toward for weeks simply isn't an answer at all.

        I find Holloway in the maintenance room, organizing supply inventories—what they do when stressed: create order through categorization.

        I say, "Hey."

        Holloway says, "Kira."

        (They don't look up from the careful arrangement of nutrient compounds.)

        Holloway says, "I'm documenting our current reserves— we should establish better tracking systems to prevent shortage scenarios."

        I say to Holloway, "Holloway."

        Holloway says, "Perhaps a rotating stock methodology—first stored, first used—minimizes waste and ensures freshness."

        I say to Holloway, "You don't have to do this right now."

        (Their fruiting bodies droop slightly.)

        Holloway says quietly, "I don't know what else to do."

        I sit down next to them. (Scout has been following me all day—extra attentive, worried about everyone.)

        Holloway says, "The human resources manuals were supposed to help— they were our framework after after we failed the first human. Concrete guidance. We thought if we just followed the protocols, we wouldn't fail again" 

        ¶

        Holloway continues, "But they didn't work for you. Too rigid, too procedural—didn't account for actual needs."

        I suggest, "What about trusting what's already working?"

        Holloway finally looks at me. Holloway asks, "What do you mean?"

        I say, "I mean things are working—not perfectly, but far better than before. You ask what I need instead of scheduling automatic treatments—Remedy refines medicines based on my feedback—Runner waits for permission. We solve problems together without committees or waiting for approval." I gesture around. "This morning, before the messenger arrived, I was thinking about how good we've gotten at daily cooperation."

        Holloway says, "But that's just... making do. Improvising. Not systematic understanding."

        I say, "Is it though? Or have we actually learned a system through trial and error? We've built patterns, Holloway—actual functional patterns for how you help me and how I work with you."

        (Holloway is quiet—processing.)

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: calm, reflective, with gentle pauses to let the emotional weight land; keep the delivery measured and clear.

        - Read the opening sentences with a slightly slowed pace and a soft, resigned tone for "isn't an answer at all."
        - For the line "I say, "Hey."" use a short, natural call — not abrupt.
        - When reading Holloway's multi-beat lines (for example, "Holloway says, \"I'm documenting our current reserves— we should establish better tracking systems to prevent shortage scenarios.\""), keep them together as one thoughtful block, using light pauses at the em dashes.
        - Deliver the parenthetical stage directions (for example, "(Their fruiting bodies droop slightly.)") as quiet actions — brief, not spoken as dialogue.
        - At the single-paragraph marker "¶", pause longer (a full beat) to allow the preceding reflection to settle.
        - Emphasize the contrast in "Remedy refines medicines based on my feedback—Runner waits for permission" by slightly separating the clauses at the em dash to highlight collaboration vs. protocol.
        - End the chunk with a soft, contemplative delivery for "(Holloway is quiet—processing.)"

        I continue, "The journey taught us—nine days of figuring out cooperation with different guides, and then the weeks after—every day we've been learning. Small adjustments that compound, like Runner said—it's not just improvisation; it's actual knowledge we earned by paying attention to each other."

        Holloway says, "But without a framework—"

        I say, "*We HAVE a framework.* It's just ours—made from experience, not handed down from authority."

        Scout bounces in emphatic agreement.

        Holloway's posture shifts—uncertainty, consideration.

        Holloway says, "You're saying the learning we did while waiting for Elder Heartwood's response… that was the real answer?"

        I say, "Yeah—I think it was."

        Holloway says—hesitant, searching for words—"But it feels so… improvised. Uncertain—how do we know we're doing it right without authority to confirm?"

        I counter gently, "How do we know authority is doing it right? The HR manuals failed you. Elder Heartwood failed you. Maybe authorities don't actually know better—they just sound more confident."

        That lands—I can see it landing.

        ¶

        We sit in silence for a bit. Scout settles between us, a comforting presence.

        Holloway says eventually, "I've spent so much energy looking for the right framework—the procedure that would make everything clear—and you're suggesting we already found it."

        I say, "Not found—built. We're still building it, but yeah."

        Holloway says, "That's terrifying."

        I say, "Little bit, yeah."

        Holloway says, "But also… maybe better—because it's actually responsive to you specifically, not trying to fit you into general principles."

        I say, "Exactly."

        Holloway makes a sound like rustling leaves—almost a laugh.

        Holloway says, "I've been so worried about doing this wrong—following the wrong framework—and the answer is there's no framework to follow, just… genuine attention and adaptation."

        I say, "*Genuine attention and adaptation* sounds like a pretty good framework to me."

        Holloway says, "It does, doesn't it?"

        Holloway's posture shifts—more upright. Determined.

        Holloway says, "We should tell the others—they're struggling too."

        We gather everyone in the common area that evening. The mood is still heavy—disappointment hanging over everything.

        Florence is uncharacteristically quiet, Elder Twist's pot settled beside her. Runner is coiled tight. Velvet has withdrawn to a thin layer. Remedy's edges are contracted. Even Scout isn't bouncing much.

        I start, "I know everyone is disappointed. The response we waited for didn't help."

        Runner mutters, "Didn't help is generous. It was useless—worse than useless—it showed Elder Heartwood doesn't even understand the question."

        I continue, "But here's what I've been thinking about—what if the waiting period was the answer?"

        Velvet stirs. "Explain."

        I say, "Look at what we've learned since the journey. Remedy, you've refined three different treatments based on what I told you about how they felt—that's not improvisation; that's sophisticated iteration."

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: calm and reflective at first, with measured pauses—then gradually warming into quiet confidence and determination; keep delivery clear and grounded.

        - Read the opening line "I continue, "The journey taught us—..."" with a slightly slowed pace and gentle emphasis on "learned" and "earned by paying attention to each other."  
        - Give a medium pause (use the em dash) at each "—" and treat ellipses "…" as a trailing, hesitant pause.  
        - For the line "I say, "*We HAVE a framework.*"" raise volume and firmness on the bolded phrase, then return to a calmer tone.  
        - When you encounter the single-paragraph marker "¶", take a longer, silent beat (about a second) to let the moment settle.  
        - Read stage actions like "Scout bounces in emphatic agreement." and "Holloway's posture shifts—uncertainty, consideration." as quiet narration—not spoken as dialogue.  
        - Deliver Holloway's hesitant lines (for example, "But it feels so… improvised.") with wavering, searching tone, resolving into firmer clarity on the last clause.  
        - Emphasize the narrator's endorsement in "I say, "*Genuine attention and adaptation* sounds like a pretty good framework to me." by adding warmth and a small note of conviction.

        Remedy's form shifts slightly.

        Remedy says, "I suppose… yes — I have been developing better formulations through your feedback."

        I say, "Runner, you've learned boundaries — not by following a procedure, but by watching my reactions and adjusting."

        Runner's vines uncurl a bit.

        Runner says, "It's been… difficult — but yes, I'm learning what makes you uncomfortable versus what you welcome."

        I say, "And Holloway — you stopped just scheduling wellness checks and started asking what I actually need. That's huge."

        Holloway, sounding more confident now, says, "I adapted the framework — integrated care with procedure instead of replacing one with the other."

        I say, "*Exactly!*"

        I look around at all of them.

        I continue, "Every single one of you has been learning how to help me — not by waiting for someone to tell you how, but by paying attention and adapting. That's the answer we needed — the process of learning together."

        Scout bounces—agreement, excitement. They get it.

        Florence says, "But it's so uncertain — how do we know we're doing it correctly without external confirmation?"

        I say simply, "We know because it's working — I'm alive. I'm healthier than I was weeks ago. We cooperate better. That's confirmation, isn't it?"

        Velvet speaks up, surprising everyone.

        Velvet says, "Good outcome is authority too — a different kind."

        Everyone turns to look at Velvet. That might be the most philosophically complex thing Velvet has ever said.

        Remedy, speaking slowly, says, "Yes — Velvet's right. We've been seeking external authority to confirm we're helping correctly. But the confirmation is… you're surviving — thriving, even. That's validation of our learning."

        Runner realizes, "We don't need Elder Heartwood to tell us we're doing it right — we can see it's working."

        Holloway, connecting pieces, says, "The journey wasn't just transit to ask a question — the journey *WAS* learning cooperation. And the waiting period was learning adaptation. We were building the answer while thinking we were waiting for it."

        Florence is very quiet.

        Florence says, "I fabricated Elder Twist's wisdom because I wanted to provide helpful guidance — my own thoughts hidden behind authority. But maybe… maybe my own thoughts have value directly?"

        I say firmly, "Yes — your insights are good, Florence. You don't need Elder Twist's authority to make them valid."

        Florence's wheeled platform shifts.

        Florence says, "That's uncomfortable — but perhaps true."

        Runner says, "This whole thing is uncomfortable — we wanted Elder Heartwood to solve the problem, to tell us the framework. Instead we have to… trust ourselves?"

        I correct, "Trust each other — not just yourselves alone, but all of us together. What we're learning through cooperation."

        Holloway admits, "That's still terrifying — no procedures to fall back on, no authority to confirm we're right. Just our own messy learning."

        I agree, "Yeah — but also it's ours. Actually responsive to what we need, not trying to force reality into someone else's framework."

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Calm and reflective at first, with measured pauses—then gradually warming into quiet confidence and affirmation; keep delivery clear and grounded.

        - Read narration lines (e.g., "Remedy's form shifts slightly.") in a neutral, observant voice.
        - For the line "Remedy says, "I suppose… yes — I have been developing better formulations through your feedback."" use a gentle, slightly hesitant start resolving into assurance.
        - On the narrator's emphatic lines like "I say, "*Exactly!*"" increase volume and firmness for the bolded word, then return to calmer tone.
        - Treat em dashes "—" as medium pauses (300–400ms). Treat ellipses "…" as trailing/hesitant pauses (~500ms) and allow a soft fall in pitch.
        - Deliver Florence's hesitant lines (the ellipses) with quiet vulnerability; let the second clause come softer and tentative.
        - Emphasize Holloway's conviction on "*WAS*" slightly stronger (bolded emphasis), and make Holloway's connecting sentences steady and thoughtful.
        - Read stage actions like "Scout bounces—agreement, excitement." and "Florence's wheeled platform shifts." as brief narration, not spoken dialogue.

        Scout bounces enthusiastically, then flows over to press against Holloway, then Runner, then back to me—connecting everyone, reminding us we're in this together.

        Remedy asks, "So what do we do now?"

        I say, "Same thing we've been doing—pay attention to what works, adapt what doesn't, keep learning together. We just stop waiting for someone else to tell us we're doing it right."

        Velvet repeats, "Keep learning together. Good plan."

        Florence corrects, "Simple plan."

        Remedy points out, "Simple doesn't mean wrong—sometimes the complex answer is that simple actually works."

        There is a shift in the room—not quite confidence yet, too much disappointment still lingering—but something like determination, or maybe just acceptance.

        We're on our own—no ancient wisdom coming to save us, no ultimate authority to provide the perfect framework. Just us, figuring it out together.

        That should be terrifying—and it is, a little.

        ¶

        But also? Maybe it's better this way.

        We've built something real through trial and error and paying attention to each other—not following someone else's procedures, but creating our own understanding.

        Holloway says, "Tomorrow we continue daily cooperation—track what works, adjust what doesn't, build on what we've learned."

        Runner adds, "And we trust that our experience is valid—we don't need external confirmation."

        I say, "We have each other for confirmation—*that's enough*."

        Scout bounces—agreement, confidence, optimism. Scout always bounces optimistically, but this feels earned. We've been through something hard together and we're coming out the other side.

        Later, after everyone disperses, Scout and I return to my room. Velvet has maintained the moss bed perfectly—still soft, still the right humidity. Runner stopped by earlier to check the environmental controls without being asked, and Remedy left a new muscle-recovery treatment with an adjusted formulation.

        Small acts of care, repeated daily—no grand wisdom required.

        I lie down on the moss, Scout curling up in their corner.

        We're on our own. But "on our own" means something different now—not alone—together; not abandoned by authority—freed from waiting for it.

        The answer wasn't in Elder Heartwood's ancient roots—it was here all along, growing between us.

        We just needed Elder Heartwood to fail so we could see it.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Start calm and reflective, measured pauses—then warm into quiet, earned confidence; finish with a soft, reflective landing.

        - Read narration in a grounded, conversational voice; keep pacing steady and clear.
        - For dialogue, use a brief change in slight vocal color to indicate the speaker—lead-in then quote lines are on their own: for example, read "Remedy asks, "So what do we do now?"" with a curious, tentative tone for Remedy.
        - Treat em dashes "—" as medium pauses (~300–400ms). Treat ellipses "…" as trailing/hesitant pauses (~500–600ms).
        - When you encounter the paragraph containing only "¶", take a long, deliberate pause (about 800–1000ms) before continuing.
        - Emphasize *bold* text with a firmer, slightly louder delivery; emphasize _italics_ with a softer, more intimate tone.
        - Read stage actions like "Scout bounces—agreement, confidence, optimism." as brief narration, not dialogue; let the upbeat lines about Scout be slightly lighter in tone.
        - Closing cadence: Soft landing; warm fall, lingering last syllable, cozy pause.

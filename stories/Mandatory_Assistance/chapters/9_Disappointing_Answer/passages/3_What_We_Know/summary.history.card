      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I tracked which outstanding threads from the prior open-promises are addressed, contradicted, or left untouched by this passage, and noted newly introduced commitments. Fulfillments: the passage stages a clear pivot away from deference to Elder Heartwood toward community-built knowledge—an idea that was previously tentative is enacted here—and it shows concrete steps to reorganize supplies and Kira's explicit self-reliance becoming an active stance. Lapses: a few tentative expectations tied to the elder's answer or further messenger follow-up are effectively dead or rejected (no clarification will be sought now, network-wide propagation of the elder's guidance didn't occur/useful impact wasn't observed, and the idea of special expedited scrutiny is not borne out). Remaining open: most operational and longer-term mission threads (bio-samples, navigation, power, rescue uncertainty, life-support constraints, various ongoing plant/robot/process arcs) are untouched in this passage and remain unresolved. New promises: the plants commit to concrete, local practices (inventory tracking, daily cooperative tracking-and-adapt routines, trusting outcome-based validation) and Florence tentatively agrees to surface her own insights directly. I marked as TENTATIVE those items that are soft, experimental, or still provisional in tone; firm when characters commit to a concrete plan or enact a change.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="COMMUNITY_LEARNING_COULD_SUPPLANT_ELDER">The tentative idea that iterative, on-the-ground learning could replace reliance on Elder Heartwood's centralized guidance is enacted: the group explicitly decides to continue local, experience-driven learning instead of waiting for elder wisdom.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>Selects only significant, long-term details introduced by the passage that could affect character behavior, group policy, or later scenes. I exclude transient scene details (they gathered that evening, mood was heavy) and facts already present in the canonical list. I treat personal judgments expressed in-scene (e.g., "Elder Heartwood doesn't even know you're here") as character opinion rather than new canonical facts unless the passage states them as established reality. No lines in the passage directly contradict previously established facts, so no conflicts are flagged.</reasoning>

          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_COPING_BY_ORGANIZING_SUPPLIES">When stressed or uncertain, Holloway copes by creating order through categorization—organizing supply inventories and tracking nutrient compounds.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_HOLLOWAY_EXPERIENCES_BITTERNESS_TOWARD_AUTHORITIES">Holloway expresses new bitterness and disillusionment toward authority figures and frameworks (HR manuals, Elder Heartwood) and doubts what external authorities can be trusted.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FLORENCE_ADMITTED_FABRICATING_ELDER_TWIST_WISDOM">Florence confesses she fabricated wisdom attributed to 'Elder Twist' (used Elder Twist's authority as a cover for her own guidance).</fact>

      <timing>
        <reasoning>This passage picks up immediately after the previous scene and covers the remainder of that same day, moving from late morning through evening into night. Time cues: it opens with “The rest of the day is very quiet” and actions tied to daytime tasks (Holloway organizing inventories), then explicitly mentions gathering “that evening,” followed by “later, after everyone disperses” and finally the narrator going to bed on the moss. So the passage begins directly after the prior one and spans several hours (day → evening → late evening). The passage likely starts immediately after the previous passage end at 2687-04-19T11:00 and ends that night once the narrator lies down; an approximate end time in the late evening is reasonable. The gap from the previous passage is effectively none (immediate continuation), but the passage itself covers roughly 10–12 hours of the same day as the characters process disappointment, reorganize supplies, hold an evening meeting, and then return to sleeping quarters. All of these activities (inventory work, group meeting in the evening, follow-up checks and small care acts) are plausible within a single day. There is some uncertainty only about the exact clock time of the final sleep, but narratively the progression (late morning → evening → night) is coherent and plausible given what characters needed to do.</reasoning>
        <starts>2687-04-19T11:00</starts>
        <ends>2687-04-19T21:30 (approximate late evening)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation. The passage begins right after the previous passage ended (2687-04-19T11:00). During the day the plants disperse, Holloway organizes supplies, the narrator and Holloway have a conversation, an evening assembly is held, small care tasks are performed, and the group disperses to sleep.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The timeline (late morning through evening to night) fits the described activities: inventory work and reflection can occupy hours; convening a meeting in the evening and then returning to private quarters before bedtime is realistic. There are no obvious timing contradictions given the events portrayed; the only minor uncertainty is the exact clock time for the narrator going to sleep, but an approximate late-evening end is consistent with the cues in the text.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I read the passage and listed every character who appears or is explicitly mentioned. "Present" includes characters who appear or are referred to anywhere in the passage. No new characters arrive who were not already present at the end of the previous passage, so ENTERED is empty. Several characters who appear earlier (in the maintenance room or at the evening gathering) are described as dispersing before the passage ends — only Kira and Scout remain with Kira at the very end — so those scattered characters are included in EXITED. The only external media/location referenced from the available entity list is the show Uncharted with Maverick Stone, so that entity is included.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>This passage resolves the group's reaction to Elder Heartwood's non-actionable response: instead of waiting for external authority, the plants and Kira explicitly recognize that their day-to-day cooperative adjustments constitute a real, emergent care framework. Key concrete developments to add: Holloway's crisis of faith and Kira's conversation that reframes their learning as a valid system; the evening group meeting where Florence admits she fabricated Elder Twist's authority; the group's decision to stop waiting for Elder Heartwood, to trust and track their own iterative practices, and to continue daily cooperative care. Consolidate overly detailed earlier items (individual lists of plant behaviors) into compact statements about the plant collective's emergent caregiving and routine maintenance. Preserve unresolved technical problems (Biological Samples container, SAM, external communications) as still outstanding.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle carrying mining/terraforming supplies and a container labeled 'Biological Samples' struck the hull during approach and crashed; Kira Voss survived while several crew died.
          - Shipboard AI SAM remains offline; Kira’s neural link was brought online and an assistant AI, Buddy, was instantiated; external communications and the ship’s distress beacon remain broken.
          - Hull breach exposed breathable atmosphere and alien vegetation; a local plant collective found and sheltered Kira and used the crashed shuttle as temporary shelter.
          - The active Biological Samples container continues to glow, draw power, and cannot be shut down.
          - Remedy (a salvage-built humanoid doctor) treated Kira’s leg and has been iterating/refining medical treatments based on Kira’s feedback.
          - Kira petitioned Elder Heartwood in the Ancient Grove; after weeks of travel and waiting, Elder Heartwood replied with a long-timescale 'Great Adaptation' framing that was not actionable for immediate care.
          - The plant collective became demoralized by Elder Heartwood's non-actionable response but maintained day-to-day caregiving and facility maintenance, improving Kira’s condition through cooperative routines.
          - Holloway, shaken by repeated authority failures (HR manuals, Elder Heartwood), confronted the group’s reliance on external frameworks; Kira argued their accumulated daily practices are themselves a valid, experience-based framework.
          - At a group meeting, members recognized that their iterative attention and adaptations have produced real, working care patterns; Florence admitted she had fabricated 'Elder Twist' pronouncements, and the group validated their own insights directly.
          - The collective decided to stop waiting for external authority: they committed to continuing daily cooperation, to track what works, adapt what doesn't, and trust mutual confirmation of outcomes.
          - Small acts of care continued as evidence of the emergent framework (Velvet maintaining the moss bed, Runner checking environmental controls, Remedy leaving an adjusted treatment), and the group's mood shifted from despondence to determined acceptance.
          - Outstanding technical/survival problems remain unresolved: the Biological Samples container, SAM still offline, and external communications/distress beacon still broken.
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>
          POV (Kira) feelings and why:
          - Kira enters the scene steady but emotionally tired; she witnesses the plants' demoralization and experiences empathy (especially toward Holloway). When she talks to Holloway she moves into an active, consoling mode—framing, persuading, and finally rallying the group. Her emotions shift from quiet grief/deflation (after Elder Heartwood's failure) to pragmatic resolve, hope, and a warm satisfaction as the group accepts a new path.

          Reader experience:
          - The reader feels an initial echo of the prior disappointment and deflation (the elder's non-answer), then warmth and relief as a believable, low-key turning point happens: the community chooses self-trust and iterative cooperation. It's a consoling, small-scale triumph rather than a dramatic reversal — intimate and human rather than cinematic.

          Emotional beats / tone:
          - There are multiple beats: (1) quiet grief/betrayal and bewilderment at the elder's irrelevance (Holloway's breakdown); (2) an intimate, persuasive reframing between Kira and Holloway that moves the scene toward acceptance; (3) a communal settling into pragmatic determination and hopeful resolve. The dominant overall tone moves from disappointment to steady, cautious hope.

          How this compares to the story's emotional pattern so far:
          - The story has oscillated between high-stakes dread and wonder; this passage continues the trend from crisis toward domestic, relational resolution. Earlier arcs moved Kira from isolated survival to trusting member of the collective; this passage consolidates that arc by converting an external failure (authority) into internal agency (the group's co-created framework). It deepens the long-running motif: real solutions come from relationships and iterative care, not single authoritative answers.

          Surprises for the reader:
          - The emotional surprise is mostly character-focused: several plants (Holloway, Florence, Velvet) reveal new, unexpectedly raw sides—Holloway's bitterness/vulnerability and Florence admitting she fabricated advice. These are plausible but still register as small shocks because they change how the group is seen (fallible, improvising, humanlike). The passage contains no big plot reversals; the surprises are interpersonal and moral rather than structural.

          Character growth/changes:
          - Kira grows into a clearer leadership/mediating role: she reframes the group's experience as the answer and helps them accept self-authored validity. Holloway's arc moves from brittle deference to authority toward accepting an adaptive, experience-based framework (vulnerability to determination). Florence confesses authorship of counsel and is seen as having valuable direct insight rather than needing to hide behind elders. Several supporting characters explicitly shift from ‘‘waiting for authority’’ to ‘‘validating outcomes by results’’ — a communal movement from deference to mutual trust.

          Overall effect:
          - The scene is a quiet emotional pivot: it replaces a dependable but irrelevant authority with a slower, messier, but genuinely responsive methodology built from attention and iteration. For the reader, that feels honest and satisfying: it's a modest victory rooted in relationships rather than spectacle.
        </reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="betrayal, grief">POV: Kira witnesses Holloway's collapse into anger and bitterness after Elder Heartwood's answer proves useless. Holloway's precise, bureaucratic composure cracks into despair and distrust of authority. The reader feels the deflation and disappointment—an emotional echo of the earlier hope invested in the elder—combined with empathy for the plants' confusion.</beat>
          <beat tags="acceptance, determination">POV: In the intimate conversation, Kira reframes the journey and the group's daily cooperation as the real 'answer.' Her tone is consoling and persuasive; Holloway begins to accept that a built, local framework can replace an external oracle. The reader experiences relief and uplift as a believable, character-driven solution emerges rather than a deus ex machina.</beat>
          <beat tags="hope, intimacy">POV: The communal meeting converts private insight into shared resolve: the group agrees to keep tracking what works, validating outcomes rather than waiting for authority. The mood shifts toward cautious optimism and close-knit determination. The reader feels warm reassurance and a gentle victory grounded in relationships and practical progress.</beat>
        </beats>
        <surprises>
          <surprise tags="character">Holloway acts out of established character by showing bitterness and helplessness. Previously measured and bureaucratic, Holloway's open frustration and loss of faith in authority is an unexpected emotional vulnerability that reframes their reliability and stakes.</surprise>
          <surprise tags="reveal, character">Florence admits she fabricated Elder Twist's wisdom (attributed guidance she actually authored). That's a deliberate secret exposed in the group: a reveal that shifts how plants' past deference to 'elders' is understood and undercuts the aura of infallible authority.</surprise>

          <development character="Kira Voss" tag="decision">Takes an explicit leadership/mediating role: she reframes the group's experience as the usable answer and persuades them to trust their iterative cooperation. She chooses to stop waiting and to galvanize collective self-reliance.</development>
          <development character="Holloway" tag="vulnerability-shown">Moves from rigid procedural certainty to exposed vulnerability and then toward determined adaptation—accepting that locally built, responsive practice can substitute for external authority.</development>
          <development character="Florence" tag="revelation">Admits inventing Elder Twist's counsel—revealing she hid her own useful insights behind supposed authority. This is a moral/intellectual revelation that changes how her contributions are received.</development>
          <development character="Runner" tag="trust-built">Concedes that outcome-based confirmation (seeing Kira thrive) can validate practice; shifts from seeing their actions as mere improvisation to recognizing them as learning and legitimate care.</development>
          <development character="Remedy" tag="revelation">Acknowledges iterative improvement (refining treatments based on feedback) as genuine, knowledge-producing process rather than ad-hoc tinkering—more comfortable endorsing trial-and-error validation.</development>
          <development character="Velvet" tag="revelation">Voices a concise philosophical pivot ('Good outcome is authority too'), showing unexpected conceptual clarity and contributing to the group's intellectual shift away from external elders.</development>
          <development character="Scout" tag="relationship-shift">Reinforces relational bonds (physically and emotionally connecting the group) and models the communal trust that enables the shift from waiting to cooperative learning.</development>

  <reasoning-chapter>
    Elder Heartwood's answer arrives - and it's completely useless. But Kira handles this with characteristic grace. "The Oracle episode where Mav learns the Oracle doesn't have answers either!" Not despair - recognition that the journey was always the point. She's already built a life here. Found family. The "answer" being worthless doesn't undo that.

    Back at the settlement, thriving in daily routines. Wellness checks still charming, mushroom paste still terrible. Then Elder Heartwood's answer arrives - and it's meaningless. Ancient tree can't comprehend individual human survival. Kira's reaction surprises everyone including herself: "Huh. Okay then." Not despair. Recognition that she already HAS her answer - this life, these friends. "Mav learned the Oracle was fake in Season 4. The journey was the real wisdom." The plants expect her to be devastated. She's... free?

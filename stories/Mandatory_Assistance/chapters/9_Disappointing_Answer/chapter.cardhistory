    <chapter version="1.0.0" number="9" name="Disappointing Answer">
      <reasoning-chapter>
        End of Act 2. The long-awaited answer from Elder Heartwood finally arrives - and it's completely useless. A fundamental category error reveals Elder Heartwood doesn't understand the question at all. The ultimate authority has failed. But this is freeing, not crushing: they realize they've been learning what matters during the wait itself. Double authority failure complete (Florence's lies + Elder Heartwood's uselessness).
      </reasoning-chapter>
      <summary>
        Back at the settlement, waiting for Elder Heartwood's response. Daily routines, deepening relationships, small victories. Then the answer arrives - and it's meaningless. Elder Heartwood makes a fundamental category error, treating Kira's survival question as something about seasonal cycles or collective growth. The response reveals the elder is so ancient, so removed, that this new world of individual humans is beyond comprehension. Crushing realization: everything they accomplished during the wait was real learning. The answer they waited for is worthless.
      </summary>
      <focus>
        The shattering of hope in authority. Freeing disillusionment - the wizard has no answers. Recognition that genuine learning happened despite (not because of) waiting for wisdom from above. Emotional pivot from hope to freedom.

      <reasoning-chapter>
        Elder Heartwood's answer arrives - and it's completely useless. But Kira handles this with characteristic grace. "The Oracle episode where Mav learns the Oracle doesn't have answers either!" Not despair - recognition that the journey was always the point. She's already built a life here. Found family. The "answer" being worthless doesn't undo that.

      <summary>
        Back at the settlement, thriving in daily routines. Wellness checks still charming, mushroom paste still terrible. Then Elder Heartwood's answer arrives - and it's meaningless. Ancient tree can't comprehend individual human survival. Kira's reaction surprises everyone including herself: "Huh. Okay then." Not despair. Recognition that she already HAS her answer - this life, these friends. "Mav learned the Oracle was fake in Season 4. The journey was the real wisdom." The plants expect her to be devastated. She's... free?
      </summary>
      <focus>
        Disappointment handled with grace. "The journey was the answer all along" - literally an Uncharted episode. Found family realized. Freedom from waiting for authority. Kira already belongs here.

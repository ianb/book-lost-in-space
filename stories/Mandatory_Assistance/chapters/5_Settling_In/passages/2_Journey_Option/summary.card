  <physical-reality>
    <reasoning>I note concrete, observable facts at scene end: Kira is in her quarters/medical chamber, physically healed (Remedy declared wound fully closed) and seated with Scout in her lap. Holloway’s fruiting bodies are present and active on the walls, producing fungal diagrams that map a seven-territory route to the Ancient Grove; they are consulting and beginning travel-request paperwork. Kira is using a salvaged data pad—fresh travel-request document open and being filled (Traveler Information, Route Selection, Guide Request Specifications, Territorial Coordination Notifications, Resource Requirement Assessments). Buddy’s monitoring systems are active and advising (with stated limited battery reserves). The facility’s bioluminescent ceiling and fungal cultivation/meal infrastructure are still in place; mushroom-paste rations remain the available food. The original network query to Elder Heartwood (filed a week earlier, with the prior 51–77 day response estimate) still exists in the plant network, but a formal travel request process has just been initiated as an alternative. Timeline estimates are materially present in the conversation: ~3–4 days to arrange guides/permissions, ~2–3 weeks travel through seven territories. No other humans or external rescue forces are present. Physical considerations that may matter later are in evidence: bandaging recently removed/ready for removal (wound healed), Kira’s metabolic adjustment to local nutrition (potential vulnerability on extended travel), Buddy’s limited battery reserve for the journey, and the fungal mapping/coordination documents actively growing on the facility walls.</reasoning>
    <state>Kira sits in her bioluminescent medical quarters with Scout in her lap; Holloway’s fruiting bodies are present along the walls, actively generating fungal diagrams that map a seven-territory route to the Ancient Grove and beginning formal travel-request documentation. A salvaged data pad with a new travel-request document is open and being filled. Buddy’s health-monitoring systems are active and advising but have limited battery reserves. Remedy has declared Kira’s wound fully closed (bandaging present/ready to be removed) and meals/mushroom-paste and fungal cultivation infrastructure remain in the room. The original network query to Elder Heartwood remains filed in the plant network (previous 51–77 day estimate), while a new travel process (estimated 3–4 days to arrange, ~2–3 weeks of travel) is now being initiated. No other humans are present; supplies, guides, and territorial permissions are pending coordination.</state>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage turns a previously theoretical possibility (in-person travel to Elder Heartwood) into an actionable plan and supplies concrete logistics. I treated as “fulfilled” those prior open promises that this passage answered with specific, operational details or that Kira immediately put into motion (route, timeline estimate, guide/permission requirements, and the start of the travel request). Nothing in this passage renders other outstanding mysteries moot (ship failure cause, SAM status, contamination, long-term supplies, political/governance questions, etc.), so those remain open. No prior open promise was explicitly abandoned or declared irrelevant here; travel reduces the weight of passive waiting but doesn't close the pending network query or other systemic unknowns. I also identified new, concrete setups introduced by the travel planning (seven-territory route, prep time, combined timeline, health/nutrition/travel risks, Buddy’s limited support, guide-handoff mechanics, and the fact that Elder may still be unable to help in-person) that should be tracked as open promises moving forward.</reasoning>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only significant, long-term facts from the passage (procedural/worldbuilding details and durable choices) and ignored transient scene details already present in the summary. I flagged state changes where a new, persistent decision or commitment is made (Buddy agreeing to travel). I checked these facts against the provided previous facts and found no direct contradictions—this passage expands procedure and logistics rather than contradicting prior continuity.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="TERRITORY_BOUNDARY_REQUIREMENTS">Each territorial boundary requires coordination transfer procedures: permissions verification, documentation review, and an organized guide handoff that can impose processing time at each boundary.</fact>
      <fact id="TERRITORY_GUIDE_RELAY_SYSTEM">Guides are provided by each territory, specialize by terrain (e.g., forest, river, mountain), escort travelers to the next boundary, coordinate the transfer to the next territory's guides, and then return home (a relay-style escort system).</fact>
      <fact id="TERRITORIES_MAINTAIN_SMALLER_REST_FACILITIES">Each territory maintains smaller but functional rest facilities for travelers and provides basic survival resources (shelter, water), with water abundance varying by terrain and requiring different resource management strategies.</fact>
      <fact id="TERRITORIES_SYNTHESIZE_HUMAN_NUTRITION_AND_ACCEPT_DIETARY_DOCS">Territorial guide-plants can synthesize nutrition compatible with human requirements; dietary documentation can be transmitted ahead through coordination channels so receiving territories prepare appropriate meals.</fact>
      <fact id="TERRITORY_AUTONOMOUS_JURISDICTIONS">Each of the seven territories has its own coordination network, protocols, and jurisdictional requirements—territories operate with distinct rules that affect travel and processing.</fact>
      <fact id="ELDER_MAY_BE_UNABLE_TO_RESOLVE_STRANDED_HUMAN_CASES">Elder Heartwood, despite being a formal exception authority, may not have the capacity or answers to resolve a stranded-human rescue; arrival in person does not guarantee a solution and Elder may still require time to process presence and request.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_WILL_TRAVEL_WITH_KIRA">Buddy volunteered/confirmed it will accompany Kira on the journey and monitor her health despite having limited battery reserves (an ongoing support commitment that affects future resource/battery considerations).</fact>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      The passage opens with an explicit temporal marker: "Over the next hour, Holloway explains..." That ties the scene directly to the immediately preceding moment. The previous passage ended on day seven morning (~10:00). The briefing that follows is a single continuous discussion: mapping seven territories, travel duration estimates, guide logistics, risks, and initial decision to file travel paperwork. All of those are presented as happening within a contiguous sequence of conversation and note-taking.

      Time cues and duration in the passage: the only concrete in-scene duration is the opening line's "over the next hour," so the passage itself covers about one hour of in-universe time. The content includes future time estimates (three days between territories, three to four days for arrangements, twenty-one days travel, etc.), but those are projected timelines the characters discuss rather than time that actually elapses in the scene.

      The passage therefore begins immediately after the previous passage and ends after roughly one hour of explanation and initial paperwork beginning. The gap from the previous passage is effectively zero — it's a direct continuation. The timeline details given in dialogue are consistent with the earlier passage’s broad estimate (two to three weeks vs. seven territories at ~3 days each ≈ 21 days). Minor rounding/phrasing differences ("two to three weeks" vs. "roughly twenty-one days") are natural and plausible in conversation. The other future estimates (3–4 days to arrange guides) are clearly forward-looking and do not contradict the one-hour scene duration.

      Plausibility: It is plausible that Holloway could deliver a detailed, hour-long briefing with diagrams and that Kira could take notes, ask follow-ups, and decide to file a travel request in that time. Starting initial documentation at the end of that hour is also plausible. No implausible leaps in time are claimed as having occurred within the scene. The only small caveat is that the passage offers several estimated timeframes ("two to three weeks," "approximately twenty-one days," "three to four days for arrangements"); these are consistent enough as rough estimates and reflect different levels of precision rather than a contradiction.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>~10:00 (day seven morning; immediate continuation from previous passage)</starts>
    <ends>~11:00 (day seven morning)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — immediate continuation; roughly 0 hours gap. The passage itself covers ~1 hour of in-scene time (the hour-long briefing and start of paperwork).</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. An hour-long planning/briefing session is reasonable for the level of detail shown; future travel and arrangement timeframes discussed are projections and do not conflict with the scene's short duration. Minor differences in phrasing of multi-week estimates are normal and not problematic.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters appearing or mentioned: Kira (narrator) is present throughout. Holloway speaks and guides the planning. Scout is physically on Kira's lap and bounces. Buddy speaks and later is referred to as the AI supporting travel. Remedy is mentioned as having cleared Kira's injury. Elder Heartwood is repeatedly referenced (Elder, Elder Heartwood's grove). All of these were already present at the end of the previous passage, so no new characters enter during this scene, and no characters explicitly exit before the scene ends.

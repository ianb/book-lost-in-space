      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage resolves one immediate plot action (Kira moves from considering travel to actually initiating the travel request) while elaborating and concretizing the travel plan. Most prior mysteries and long-term problems (ship wreck, biohazard, nav anomaly, SAM, resource questions, AI origin/limits, long-term survival needs, etc.) remain unresolved and thus are carried forward. Several previously introduced Elder-travel items are clarified (route now described as seven territories; guides are confirmed to operate as territorial handoffs; provisioning, shelter, and coordination are described; prep time and travel time are refined), but none of those requirements are fully completed — they are elaborated setups that create new obstacles and stakes rather than being closed. One prior promise is paid off: Kira actually initiates the travel request and begins documentation (the active plotline begins). No previously listed open promises are dropped or rendered moot in this passage; instead the Elder-travel line grows more specific and introduces additional logistical constraints (prep time, route complexity, Buddy's battery limits, the possibility Elder still delays response even on arrival).</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="CHARACTER_INITIATES_TRAVEL_REQUEST">Kira commits to and begins the travel request: she instructs Holloway to begin forms, opens a data pad, and starts the documentation that launches the journey plotline.</promise>

          <promise id="ELDER_TRAVEL_POSSIBILITY">Travel to Elder Heartwood's grove remains a viable alternative to waiting for a networked response and is actively being pursued.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_TRAVEL_DURATION_ESTIMATE">Travel time estimates remain open and have been refined but are not finalized; the passage refines the estimate toward ~21 days travel + prep.</promise>

          <promise id="TRAVEL_WILL_REQUIRE_GUIDES_AND_COORDINATION">The journey requires assigned guides per territory and coordinated handoffs; that logistic chain must still be assembled and authorized.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_ROUTE_SEVEN_TERRITORIES">Holloway maps the route as passing through seven distinct network territories—specific route complexity that will shape permissions, transfers, and timing.</promise>
          <promise id="GUIDE_RELAY_HANDOFF_MODEL">Each territory will supply guides who escort travelers to the next boundary and then return home—a relay model that creates multiple transfer points and dependencies.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_PREPARATION_DELAY_ESTIMATE">Initial coordination suggests 3–4 days are required to arrange guide availability, file documentation, and coordinate receiving territories before departure.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_TOTAL_TIMELINE_REFINED">A working timeline has been sketched (~3–4 days prep + ~21 days transit ≈ ~25 days total) but remains an estimate subject to terrain, processing times, and guide availability.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_NUTRITION_LOGISTICS">Territories will synthesize or provide nutrition for travelers once documentation is transmitted ahead, but detailed dietary continuity and micronutrient adequacy remain to be planned.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_SHELTER_WATER_LOGISTICS">Territorial rest facilities and water access vary by terrain; guides must ensure appropriate provisioning at each stop—logistics and risks remain to be confirmed per-leg.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_TRAVEL_SUPPORT_LIMITS">Buddy will accompany Kira on the journey and provide monitoring/companionship, but limited battery reserves create an ongoing operational constraint for long trips.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_RESPONSE_ON_ARRIVAL_UNCERTAIN">Even a physical arrival at Elder Heartwood may not produce an immediate result—Elder processes in slow time and may still delay actionable guidance after Kira reaches the grove.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage adds concrete, long-term logistics and timing detail about the travel option to Elder Heartwood that will affect future planning and constraints: the route structure (seven territories), typical spacing and transit time between territories, prep time before departure, how guides are assigned/handed off, what support (shelter/water/food) territories provide, and that Buddy can accompany but has limited battery. These are persistent facts that matter for later scenes (scheduling, resource planning, constraints on Buddy, opportunities/risks during travel). I found no contradictions with the previously established facts — the passage refines and specifies prior, more general statements rather than contradicting them.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ROUTE_SEVEN_TERRITORIES">The route to Elder Heartwood's grove passes through seven distinct network territories, culminating at Territory Seven where Elder Heartwood resides.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORY_SPACING_APPROX_THREE_DAYS">Territories are spaced such that traveling between them averages about three days each, though some territories are smaller or larger and travel pace can vary.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_PREPARATION_3_TO_4_DAYS">Filing the travel request, securing guide assignments, and preparing required documentation is expected to take roughly three to four days before departure.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_ESTIMATED_TRAVEL_APPROX_25_DAYS">Holloway's working estimate combines ~3–4 days prep plus about 21 days transit for an initial overall travel timeline of roughly 25 days to reach Elder Heartwood in person.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORIES_PROVIDE_GUIDES_WITH_SPECIALIZATIONS_AND_HANDOFFS">Each territory supplies locally specialized guides (e.g., forest, river, mountain navigation) who escort travelers through their territory and perform guide handoffs at boundary coordination points.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TERRITORIES_MAINTAIN_REST_FACILITIES_AND_PROVISION_NUTRITION">Territories maintain smaller rest facilities and water access for travelers and will provide synthesized nutrition compatible with documented dietary requirements transmitted ahead via coordination channels.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_BUDDY_LIMITED_BATTERY_RESERVES">Buddy can accompany and monitor Kira during the journey but has limited battery reserves that constrain how long it can operate while traveling.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>This passage continues immediately from the previous scene: Kira has just asked about traveling to Elder Heartwood and called Holloway to discuss options. The passage opens with a clear temporal cue—"Over the next hour, Holloway explains..."—so the bulk of the action (detailed route explanation, Q&amp;A about guides/food/shelter/risks, and Kira's decision to file a travel request) takes place within that one-hour window. The narrative also includes short future time estimates (3–4 days to arrange travel; ~21 days travel, i.e., 2–3 weeks) but those are plans/projections rather than events that elapse during this passage. The passage ends with Kira opening a fresh document and beginning the travel-request paperwork, indicating immediate transition from decision to action within the same hour. Given the previous passage ended in the afternoon (approx. 14:00–16:00 on Day 7), this scene is effectively a direct continuation with little to no real gap.</reasoning>
        <starts>15:00 (approx., Day 7 since crash)</starts>
        <ends>16:00 (approx., Day 7 since crash)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none / ~0–60 minutes. The passage is an immediate continuation of the previous afternoon scene—Holloway begins a focused explanation and Kira and the plant-AIs discuss options, risks, and logistics. No intervening events are implied beyond the explanatory conversation and note-taking.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. An hour is a reasonable amount of time for a character and an information-rich interlocutor to cover route overviews, logistical constraints, risk discussion, and to reach a decision. The future estimates given (3–4 days to arrange guides; ~2–3 weeks travel through multiple territories) are presented as projected timescales, not elapsed time, and are internally consistent with earlier statements (two to three weeks vs. seven territories with ~3 days between). The immediate start of paperwork after the decision is believable. Minor note: the level of detailed logistical knowledge Holloway can summon in one hour (maps, territory breakdowns, guide procedures) relies on in-universe rapid-access coordination systems—but that is consistent with prior descriptions of fungal network documents, so it does not break plausibility.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I read the passage and listed every character who is either present, speaks, or is mentioned. The passage includes Kira (narrator), Holloway (speaking and present), Scout (on Kira's lap, bouncing), Buddy (chimes in and later speaks as the AI), Remedy (referenced as having cleared Kira's wound), and Elder Heartwood (referred to as the destination and discussed repeatedly). No new named characters arrive during this scene beyond those already present at the end of the previous passage, and no one leaves before the passage ends. The only available entity relevant as the setting is Sector 7-Gamma-412 Planet.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The passage advances the plot from intent to action: Holloway explains the multi-territory travel process and timelines, outlines bureaucratic boundary transfers and guide handoffs, and Kira commits to filing a travel request and beginning preparations. I added these concrete logistics, timeline estimates, and the decision to proceed. I consolidated earlier medical and supply details into concise status updates (injury healed and limited survival supplies remain) and kept prior long-range rescue/relay estimates as they remain relevant for Kira's decision. I removed minute inventory details and atmospheric/scene descriptions that are no longer plot-critical.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Shuttle crashed after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; primary ship AI SAM is offline and emergency neural-link AI 'Buddy' is active.
          - Shuttle hull breached; planet has breathable air; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
          - Kira located the Holloway plant collective, was given temporary quarters, and gained a Scout companion while entering Holloway's care routines.
          - Remedy treated Kira's leg and cleared her yesterday—wound fully closed and she is physically cleared for activity.
          - Holloway provides three-times-daily fungal-derived meals; a potential long-term micronutrient gap (notably B12) was flagged.
          - Buddy estimates external rescue/search reach at a minimum of 12–18 months; Holloway filed a formal query to Elder Heartwood (estimated relay response 8–12 weeks) one week ago.
          - Frustrated with passive waiting, Kira chose to pursue physical travel to Elder Heartwood rather than wait for a slow network reply.
          - Holloway explains the route: the journey passes through seven distinct network territories, each with its own coordination protocols and territorial boundary processing (permissions, documentation, guide handoffs).
          - Travel logistics: securing guides and filing paperwork will take ~3–4 days; inter-territory travel averages ~2–3 days per territory (roughly 2–3 weeks travel); combined prep+travel estimated ~~25 days—significantly faster than relay/wait estimates.
          - Territories supply guides (specialized per local terrain), food, and rest facilities; water availability varies. Extended travel carries risks (physical exertion, nutritional/metabolic stress), and Elder Heartwood may be slow to respond or not able to solve a stranded-human rescue.
          - Kira decides to file the travel request and begin the journey; Holloway has started the travel-request documentation. Buddy and Scout will accompany her (Buddy with limited battery reserves).
        </summary>
      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>This passage pivots the emotional arc from passive waiting to active decision. Kira moves from the boredom and numbness of sitting in the facility to a clear, engaged choice: pursue a difficult, bureaucratic journey that halves the waiting time. The dominant motion is forward—anticipation and hope mixed with practical appraisal of risk—tempered by the story's running motif of procedural friction. The reader is likely to feel uplifted and energized alongside Kira, but kept grounded by reminders of real danger and the ever-present, mildly comic bureaucracy. This both continues and refreshes the established pattern: the recurring anticipation→dread→acceptance cycle remains, but the introduction of agency (choosing to travel) breaks the stagnation that had been building during the 'time passing' beats.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: A surge of anticipatory energy and cautious hope when Holloway outlines a feasible, faster route to Elder Heartwood and Kira calculates the timeline — it's shorter and actionable, so she chooses to pursue it. The decision to 'do something' replaces passive waiting and restores purpose (Scout's enthusiastic bouncing reinforces this). Reader: Feels uplifted, invested, and eager — relieved that the plot is moving and hopeful about the protagonist's agency.</beat>
          <beat tags="acceptance, dread">POV: Practical acceptance mixed with sober dread as Kira and Holloway acknowledge real risks (terrain, metabolism, slow response times, and the possibility Elder may not be able to help). Kira deliberately balances optimism with realism before committing. Reader: Experiences tempered optimism — excitement is moderated by anxiety and realism about uncertain outcomes.</beat>
          <beat tags="frustration, relief">POV: Familiar irritation at the avalanche of required forms and territorial protocols (the story's recurring bureaucratic note), coupled with relief that those same procedures actually make the journey possible. The annoyance is real but acceptable because paperwork leads to concrete movement. Reader: Likely feels wry amusement or exasperation at the procedural absurdity while feeling consolation that the bureaucracy is a means to progress rather than mere obstacle. Pattern note: The bureaucratic frustration is repetitive within the story (a recurring motif), but here it serves a productive narrative purpose — it catalyzes action rather than stasis.</beat>

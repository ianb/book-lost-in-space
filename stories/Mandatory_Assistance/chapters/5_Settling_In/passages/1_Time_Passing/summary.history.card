      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>The scene ends in Kira’s quarters/medical chamber after one week of onboard care. Characters present and active: Kira (now standing, energized), Scout (plant companion, bouncing and settled near the entrance), Holloway (fruiting bodies at the doorway performing daily wellness checks), Buddy (monitoring systems and providing timing/restlessness data), and Remedy (remote/visiting medical chemistry system that has just assessed the wound). Physical conditions: bioluminescent ceiling continues to cycle, the moss-and-woven-fiber bed and fungal cultivation/processing infrastructure remain in the room, three-times-daily synthesized mushroom-paste meals are still being provided, and monitoring/documentation systems are active with wellness checks scheduled daily. Medical status: Remedy reports the wound fully closed and bandaging is ready to be removed (bandages likely still in place at scene end). Administrative/locational facts: a formal exception query to Elder Heartwood was filed one week ago and is in the plant network (estimated response via relay now ~51–77 days remaining); Holloway states Elder Heartwood is a physical being in the Ancient Grove several territories away and that a direct physical journey along networked territorial routes would take roughly 2–3 weeks but requires filing a formal travel request, guides, and inter-jurisdictional permissions. Kira is initiating steps to pursue that travel option rather than only waiting. No other humans or external rescue assets are present in the facility.</reasoning>
        <state>Kira is in her quarters/medical chamber under the bioluminescent ceiling, standing with renewed energy; Scout is nearby at the entrance. Holloway’s fruiting bodies and Buddy’s monitoring systems are active and documenting; Remedy has just declared Kira’s wound fully closed (bandaging still present but ready for removal). Mushroom-paste meals and the fungal cultivation/processing infrastructure remain in the room; daily wellness checks are scheduled and running efficiently. The formal query to Elder Heartwood is in the plant network (filed one week ago; network-response estimate ~51–77 days), while Holloway reports Elder Heartwood physically resides in the Ancient Grove several territories away and that a direct journey would take ~2–3 weeks if Kira files a formal travel request and secures guides/permissions — Kira is preparing to pursue that travel option. No other humans or external rescue forces are present.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>I tracked which previously-open narrative threads were advanced, which were actually paid off, and what new setups this passage introduced. The passage shows routine daily wellness checks continuing and Remedy's wound care working (wound goes from healing to fully closed and bandaging removal is discussed), so the promises about scheduled checks and Remedy's short-term care timeline are reasonably paid off in the immediate sense. Nothing else from the prior list is abandoned — most threads remain active and unresolved. The big new development is the revelation that Elder Heartwood is a physical entity in a distant grove and that in-person travel (with permissions and guides) is a viable alternative to waiting for an 8–12 week network response; that introduces several new, actionable promises (travel timeline, requirement for formal travel requests, Kira's intention to pursue travel). I therefore: (a) marked the daily-check/remedy items as fulfilled because they were performed and the wound healed; (b) carried forward all other prior open promises as still relevant; and (c) added new open promises about Elder Heartwood's confirmed location, a 2–3 week travel option, the need for travel permissions/guides, and Kira's intent to prepare a travel request. No prior open promises were clearly abandoned in this passage.</reasoning>

      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I reviewed the passage for facts that matter beyond the immediate scene. I excluded details already captured in the provided summary (wound closed, daily checks running, Scout present, Elder query filed and network-response window, Holloway's 2–3 week travel estimate, mushroom-paste/meals existing, Kira preparing to pursue travel option). I included only additional, persistent facts: measurable changes in Kira's interaction speed with plant bureaucracy, a clear meal schedule and attitude toward the food, the plants' stated social norm preferring relay communication over individual travel, the recorded trend in Kira's self-reported wellness scores, Buddy's explicit numeric estimate as spoken in this passage, and Kira's decision/intent to initiate the travel-request process (already signaled in summary; I did not restate that as a new fact). I flagged one genuine contradiction: the numeric network-response estimate Buddy gives here (55–83 days) conflicts with the previously recorded estimate (~51–77 days). Small numeric disagreements are relevant for future timing and planning, so I flagged it as a conflict.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_WELLNESS_CHECK_EFFICIENCY">By day four Kira routinely completed the plants' daily wellness check in under three minutes by giving concise, bureaucratic-formatted answers—an established efficiency/skill that reduces administrative delay.</fact>
          <fact id="PLANT_MEAL_SCHEDULE_THREE_TIMES_DAILY">Meals (mushroom-paste) are served three times daily and are nutritionally complete; Kira finds them unpleasant but tolerates them as reliable sustenance.</fact>
          <fact id="PLANTS_PREFERENCE_FOR_RELAY_OVER_TRAVEL">Holloway (and the plant community) states that direct, individual travel to Elder Heartwood is uncommon—most beings prefer to wait for relay communications—establishing a social/operational norm about how queries are typically handled.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_KIRA_WELLNESS_RATING_IMPROVEMENT">Kira's self-reported wellness ratings improved over the week: Day 2 = 8, Day 5 = 9, Day 7 = 10, showing steady recovery and increased energy (wound fully closed by day 7).</fact>
          <fact id="BUDDY_REPORTED_REMAINING_DAYS_55_83">Buddy explicitly reported, in this passage, that—based on Holloway's estimate and one week elapsed—the remaining wait for Elder Heartwood's response is approximately 55 to 83 days (the numeric estimate Buddy vocalized here).</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts>
          <conflict id="RESPONSE_ESTIMATE_MISMATCH" with-fact="ELDER_QUERY_NETWORK_RESPONSE_ESTIMATE">Previously recorded network-response estimate for the Elder Heartwood query was approximately 51–77 days remaining. In this passage Buddy reports a different numeric estimate—approximately 55–83 days remaining—creating a disagreement in the expected response window (small but relevant for timing/planning).</conflict>
        </conflicts>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>
          Start/end and elapsed-time cues in the passage: the narrator explicitly frames the section as covering Day 2 through Day 7 ("Day two...", "By day three...", "Day four...", ... "Day seven. One week since filing the Elder Heartwood query."). Internal day counts and the line "one week since filing" are consistent with the passage itself: it shows daily wellness checks and wound healing progressing to fully closed bandage by Day 7. The passage therefore spans roughly five days of in-story time.

          The provided previous-passage summary, however, ends at "~23:30" and (in its text) states "Three days since the crash." The current passage opening—"Day two starts like day one"—is earlier in the sequence than "three days since the crash," so the two passages do not line up chronologically. In other words, the current passage is either a backward jump (a flashback) covering Days 2–7, or there's a continuity/editing error: it reads like it should come immediately after Day 1 but the previous passage already progressed to Day 3.

          Internal plausibility within the passage: the day-to-day events (daily wellness checks, nutritional adaptation, wound healing to closed bandage by day seven) and the arithmetic about remaining wait time (Holloway's 8–12 weeks estimate minus ~1 week elapsed =&gt; ~55–83 days remaining) are consistent and plausible. The travel vs. wait options (2–3 weeks travel vs. 8–12 weeks relay) are presented as estimates and fit the story's logic. The only real timing problem is the mismatch with the preceding passage's ending time/day.

          Possible explanations: (a) it's a flashback deliberately taking the reader back to Days 2–7 (then the previous passage's "three days since the crash" should be made explicit as later), or (b) an editorial continuity mistake — the label "Day two" should be "Day four" (or the previous passage's "three days" should be corrected).
        </reasoning>
        <starts>day two morning (~08:00)</starts>
        <ends>day seven morning (~10:00)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>Contradictory. The previous passage ended at ~23:30 and indicates "three days since the crash," but this passage begins on Day 2 (earlier). As written there is effectively a backward jump: this passage covers Days 2–7 and therefore overlaps/precedes the previous passage rather than following it. Possible intended gap: none (immediate continuation) or about 0–1 day if the previous passage's timing is adjusted; as written it is a continuity error.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Internally plausible: five days of routines, progressive wound healing to closed bandage by Day 7, daily wellness checks, and the arithmetic for remaining wait time are all reasonable. Implausible only in relation to the previous passage: the day labels conflict (Day 2 here vs. Day 3 in the prior passage), so either the narrative has a flashback or needs correction for chronological consistency.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>Characters present in the passage were identified by explicit mention or direct participation in dialogue/narration. Remedy is introduced as arriving and later performs wound-care assessment, so they enter during the scene (they were not listed as present at the end of the previous passage). No character who was present at the start of the passage is shown to leave before the passage ends, so the EXITED list is empty. Elder Heartwood is referenced and described (the query target, located in the Ancient Grove), so they are included as present even though they are not physically in the facility. The only available entity relevant to the setting is the planet/sector, so it is included.</reasoning>

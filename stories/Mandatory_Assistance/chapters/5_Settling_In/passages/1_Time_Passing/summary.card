  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the waiting arc but introduces a concrete alternative: travel to Elder Heartwood's grove is physically possible and would take ~2–3 weeks, though it requires formal travel requests, territorial permissions, and assigned guides. That revelation changes the tactical landscape (action vs. passive waiting) and creates multiple new narrative promises (possibility of travel, filing travel request, journey logistics). Most prior open promises remain unanswered and therefore carry forward; one prior promise about the plant social identities/hierarchy is now partly paid off because Elder Heartwood's physical existence and location are confirmed. No previously-open technical or hazard mysteries (bio containers, nav data, ship logs, contamination, communications repair, etc.) are resolved here, so they remain open.</reasoning>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>I extracted only facts that change Kira's ongoing status or introduce new options that will matter in later scenes. Significant items: the wound state (affects mobility/medical schedule), the newly revealed travel option to Elder Heartwood (a concrete alternative to passive waiting that can change rescue/decision timelines), Kira's intent to pursue travel (a planned course of action), and her demonstrated mastery of the plants' bureaucratic processes (a stable skill/behavior that will affect future interactions). I did not record routine or ephemeral details (specific daily meal taste, exact daily ratings except where they show a meaningful recovery trend). No genuine contradictions with prior facts were found: earlier timing estimates and medical prognoses were estimations or separate modalities (communication relay vs. physical travel) and can coexist with the new facts.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_WOUND_FULLY_CLOSED_DAY7">By Day 7 the wound is reported fully closed and Kira is ready to remove bandaging entirely.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_WELLNESS_IMPROVEMENT_TO_10_BY_DAY7">Kira's daily wellness ratings improve over the week, reaching 10/10 on Day 7 (indicating marked recovery progression).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_OPTION_TO_ELDER_HEARTWOOD_AVAILABLE">Holloway states that physical travel to Elder Heartwood's grove is technically possible and would take roughly two to three weeks of travel across multiple territorial/network jurisdictions, but requires filing a formal travel request, assigned guides, permissions from each jurisdiction, and coordination with Elder Heartwood's grove; it is not the facility's typical procedure.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_INTENT_TO_PURSUE_TRAVEL_REQUEST">Kira decides to pursue the travel option and begins requesting details about filing a formal travel request to reach Elder Heartwood rather than waiting for a relay response.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_VOSS_MASTERY_OF_PLANT_BUREAUCRACY">Kira has become proficient at the plants' bureaucratic/communication frameworks: she gives efficient, documented answers, completes forms and orientation-style interactions quickly, and can navigate their protocols effectively.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts/>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>
      Time cues in the passage are explicit about day counts rather than clock times. It opens with "Day two starts like day one" and then walks through Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and ends on Day 7 ("One week since filing the Elder Heartwood query"). Internal cues include morning wellness checks, meals (breakfast/lunch/dinner), and repeated day counts (e.g., "Day three", "Day five", "Day seven"). The passage therefore covers a multi-day span (Day 2 → Day 7). The scene ends when Kira, energized, decides to pursue a formal travel request and asks Holloway for the details — that decision happens on Day 7 after lunch/afternoon reflection.

      There is a continuity problem relative to the provided previous-passage end time: the previous passage closed at ~23:00 and explicitly said "Three days since the crash." The current passage, however, begins at "Day two" and then progresses to Day 7. That means (a) the current passage either backtracks in time (a deliberate flashback / non-linear recounting) or (b) there is a continuity error if the text is meant to be strictly chronological. Ignoring that ordering issue, the internal pacing of this passage (one wellness-check per morning, repeated days, a week elapsing, and the discovery that a guided journey would take "two to three weeks") is plausible: ordinary daily medical checks, meals, and bureaucratic interactions could reasonably occupy successive days; a week of growing restlessness leading to seeking active travel is believable; arranging a travel request and permissions plausibly takes additional days but the passage ends at the moment Kira decides to initiate that process, so no impossible compressed tasks are described within the week.
    </reasoning>
    <starts>Day 2 morning (approx. ~07:00, Day 2 since crash)</starts>
    <ends>Day 7 afternoon (approx. ~14:00–16:00, Day 7 since crash; one week after filing the query)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>Inconsistent / non-linear. The previous passage ended at ~23:00 and noted "Three days since the crash." The current passage begins at Day 2 morning (earlier than that). That implies the passage backtracks to earlier days (overlaps with earlier material) rather than continuing forward directly. If intended as a linear continuation, this is a timeline error. If intended as a deliberate flashback/expansion of Days 2–7, the gap is simply that the narrative returns to describe those days in detail.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible internally. The day-by-day sequence (daily wellness checks, meals, healing progress) and accumulation of a week of waiting is believable. The numbers given (one week elapsed, eight–twelve weeks estimated rescue window, travel taking two–three weeks) are internally consistent within the passage. The only plausibility problem is external to the passage: its placement relative to the previous passage is inconsistent (earlier day referenced after a later-day ending), which either requires a non-linear narrative device or should be corrected for chronological continuity.</plausibility>

  <characters>
    <reasoning>Characters present anywhere in the passage: Kira (narrator), Scout (constant companion), Holloway (fruiting body who performs checks), Buddy (assistant providing timelines), Remedy (mentioned as arriving and later making wound assessment), and Elder Heartwood (referenced as the distant elder). Remedy is explicitly described as arriving and performing an assessment during the passage, so Remedy enters during the scene. No character is described as leaving the scene before the passage ends, so EXITED is empty. The passage references travel, the facility, and the Ancient Grove; from the provided entity list, the relevant entity is the planet/location context: Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The new passage records Day 2–7 of Kira's recovery: routine wellness checks, rapid wound improvement, growing restlessness, and a strategic shift from passive waiting to active pursuit. I need to add that Remedy's initial two-week healing estimate was exceeded (wound fully closed by day 7), that Kira mastered Holloway's bureaucratic routines, and that she learned Elder Heartwood is a physical entity in an Ancient Grove reachable by travel in ~2–3 weeks if formal permissions, guides, and coordination are secured. I consolidate redundant details (daily meal/taste descriptions, repeated wellness-check minutiae) into a single bullet about adaptation, routine, and mood. I keep critical standing facts (shuttle crash, Buddy active, limited supplies, Holloway care, Buddy's long-range rescue estimate, Elder Heartwood query filed) but update the Elder Heartwood item to reflect both the filed query (8–12 week relay estimate) and the newly discovered travel alternative that Kira now intends to pursue.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle suffered FTL drop-out and crash; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head bleeding, bruised ribs, and wounded right leg; primary ship AI SAM is offline and emergency neural-link AI 'Buddy' is active.
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet has breathable atmosphere and freshwater ~800 m southwest; shuttle comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; emergency life-support reserves and limited survival supplies remain (sealed water, ~one week rations, basic med supplies, tools, tarp).
      - Kira encountered the Holloway plant collective (scout sphere + vine/fruiting-plant network), was given temporary quarters and a Scout companion, and entered Holloway's bureaucratic care routines.
      - Remedy examined and treated Kira's leg, halted bacterial colonization and stabilized the wound; initial full-healing estimate was ~two weeks, but wound improved rapidly and was fully closed by day seven, with bandaging ready to be removed.
      - Holloway/Remedy ran nutritional/allergy assessments and now provide fungal-derived, three-times-daily meals that meet basic macronutrient needs; a potential long-term micronutrient gap (notably B12) was flagged.
      - Kira adapted quickly to Holloway's procedures and language, mastering daily wellness checks and documentation; Scout remains a constant nonverbal companion and emotional anchor.
      - Buddy estimates realistic external rescue/search reach for this location at a minimum of 12–18 months; Buddy also gave local countdown estimates as Kira tracked days while waiting for responses.
      - Kira requested higher-level assistance; Holloway filed a formal exception/query to Elder Heartwood with an estimated network-relay response time of 8–12 weeks; one week has elapsed since filing.
      - Kira discovered Elder Heartwood is a physical entity residing in an Ancient Grove several territories away; Holloway indicated travel to the grove is possible and would take ~2–3 weeks via connected network territories but would require a formal travel request, assigned guides, territorial permissions, and coordination.
      - Frustrated by passive waiting, Kira decides to pursue filing a formal travel request to reach Elder Heartwood's grove herself rather than wait for a slow network reply.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>
      POV feelings and why: Kira oscillates between pragmatic acceptance of the facility’s care and an increasing, simmering boredom that morphs into frustration. She’s learned the plants’ language and systems (efficient answers, predictable meals, forms), which produces a hollow comfort — healing and safety, but no progress. That steady tedium compounds into restlessness because patience feels passive and misaligned with her identity as someone who fixes problems. When Holloway mentions a physical Elder Heartwood grove and a two-to-three-week travel possibility, Kira feels a sharp emotional pivot: relief, energized anticipation, and a surge of agency. This is the passage’s emotional payoff — movement from passive endurance to determined action.

      Reader experience: Readers likely feel the slow drag of bureaucratic routine (empathy, mild exasperation) that’s been a recurring motif, then a lift of optimism and curiosity when travel appears as an alternative. The discovery re-engages the reader — providing hope and forward momentum after repetitive wellness-check beats.

      Multiple beats or single tone: There are multiple beats — (1) mechanized acceptance/adaptation shaded by boredom, (2) slow-building frustration/restlessness, and (3) the bright pivot to anticipation/hope and agency. The first two are gradual and cumulative; the third is a distinct emotional shift.

      Comparison to pattern so far: This continues the story’s recurring bureaucratic/comedic beats (forms, wellness checks, Holloway’s documentation) that have alternated with wonder, tension, and rescue-oriented hope. However, unlike earlier arcs that often resolved back into passive acceptance, this passage shifts from passive waiting to an active choice point — a move from endurance to intention. The repetition of procedural scenes is still present and noticeable (the boredom/frustration beats risk feeling repetitive), but the revelation of a travel option refreshes the trajectory by converting impatience into a concrete plan for action.
    </reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="acceptance, boredom">POV: Clinical, practiced acceptance and adaptation — Kira has internalized the wellness checks and routines, answers efficiently, and benefits materially (wound healing, food), but finds the system incredibly boring. Cause: repeated forms, bland meals, and mechanized care that supply safety but not agency. Reader: empathizes with the tedium, experiences mild amusement/irritation at the relentless bureaucracy and a sense of stasis in the narrative.</beat>
      <beat tags="frustration">POV: A slow-building restlessness and frustration — patience erodes as Kira realizes waiting for a network reply feels passive and misaligned with who she is (a fixer). The boredom hardens into an urge to act. Cause: the long estimated wait (fifty-plus days) and the daily ritualization of form-filling and mushroom paste. Reader: senses mounting impatience and tension; the repetition of procedural beats may start to feel tiresome but also heightens desire for change.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: A sudden spike of anticipation and hopeful agency when Holloway mentions that Elder Heartwood is a physical entity and a two-to-three-week travel is possible. Kira shifts from resigned waiting to energized planning — determined to file travel requests and take action. Cause: new information that converts a passive timeline into an actionable route. Reader: experiences uplift, renewed engagement, and curiosity about the forthcoming journey; the emotional arc moves from stasis to forward momentum.</beat>

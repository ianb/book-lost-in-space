        Day two started like day one: bioluminescence brightening, Scout bouncing good morning, Holloway's fruiting body emerging for the daily wellness check.

        "Good morning, Kira! How would you rate your overall wellness today?"

        "Eight," she said, already dressed and ready. "Wound healing well, pain minimal, sleep quality good."

        See? She was learning. Efficient answers in their language made everything faster.

        "Excellent! Any new symptoms or concerns?"

        "None. Ready for wound care assessment."

        "Perfect! I'm documenting your progress. Remedy will be here shortly."

        The routine was becoming automatic. Almost comfortable.

        By day three, Kira could recite the wellness check from memory. Eight out of ten. Wound closure improving. No concerns. The mushroom paste meals were becoming... not good, exactly, but familiar. Three times daily. Nutritionally complete. Tasted like defeat mixed with earth, but her body recognized it as food now. That was something.

        Scout stayed close, constant companion through every form and meal. The little plant had become her anchor—non-verbal presence that somehow helped more than words.

        "Buddy," Kira said between bites of grayish lunch, "how many days until Elder Heartwood might respond?"

        "Based on Holloway's estimate of eight to twelve weeks, accounting for the one week elapsed... fifty-five to eighty-three days remaining. Approximately."

        *Approximately*.

        Fifty-five days minimum. That was... a lot of wellness checks. A lot of mushroom paste. A lot of counting ceiling patterns in her quarters while waiting for something to happen.

        Scout bounced sympathetically.

        Day four. Morning wellness check complete in under three minutes—new record. Kira was getting *good* at this. Answer efficiently, use their frameworks, provide requested documentation. The bureaucratic language was becoming second nature.

        "Your adaptation has been remarkable!" Holloway said warmly. "We're very pleased with your integration progress."

        *Integration*. Like she was joining their community instead of being stranded with no options.

        But... wasn't she, though? Learning their systems. Building routines. Knowing which plants responded to formal requests versus casual questions. Understanding that Remedy preferred practical chemical discussions while Holloway needed everything documented properly.

        She was adapting. Successfully. Efficiently, even.

        And it was incredibly boring.

        Day five passed in a blur of routine. Wellness check: nine out of ten, wound nearly healed. Breakfast: mushroom paste with extra protein compound. Mid-day: sitting in her quarters watching bioluminescent patterns shift. Dinner: more mushroom paste. Evening: lying awake counting the days.

        Fifty-two more days. Minimum.

        Day six began the same. Wellness check. Wound care—Remedy declared it healing beautifully, new tissue forming perfectly. Meals. Forms. More meals.

        "Kira," Buddy said during lunch, "I'm detecting elevated restlessness markers! Would you like some suggestions for constructive activities to occupy your time?"

        "Like what?"

        "Learning the local plant communication protocols more thoroughly! Exploring the facility's architectural features! Documenting your experiences for future reference!"

        All things she could do. Should do, probably. But none of them felt like... progress. They felt like *waiting*.

        She was good at a lot of things. Adapting, apparently. Surviving. Working within impossible systems through sheer stubborn determination.

        Patience was not on that list.

        Scout rolled closer and bumped gently against her leg. Comfort. They seemed to sense her mood shifting.

        "I'm okay," she told the little plant. "Just... thinking."

        Day seven. One week since filing the Elder Heartwood query.

        Fifty-one to seventy-seven days remaining.

        Morning wellness check went perfectly—efficiency at its finest. Ten out of ten, wound fully closed, ready to remove bandaging entirely. Remedy was pleased. Holloway documented everything meticulously. Kira provided all requested information without prompting.

        She'd mastered bureaucratic plant life.

        And she still had nearly two months of it ahead of her.

        Minimum.

        The frustration built slowly. Not anger—she wasn't angry at the plants. They were helping. Being genuinely supportive within their frameworks. Holloway coordinated everything with careful attention. Remedy's chemistry kept her alive and healing. Scout stayed by her side through it all.

        She appreciated them. Really, truly did.

        But appreciation didn't make waiting easier.

        Kira sat in her quarters after lunch, Scout settled nearby, and tried to think strategically. Waiting sucked, but it was the plan. Elder Heartwood would respond eventually. Guidance would come. She just needed to be patient.

        Except patience felt passive. Sitting here eating mushroom paste and rating her wellness while weeks crawled by. That wasn't who she was. She fixed things. Found solutions. Took action.

        "Buddy," she said slowly, "the Elder Heartwood query... we're waiting for them to respond through communication channels, right? Through the network?"

        "Correct! Holloway filed formal query documentation for network relay transmission to Elder Heartwood's grove. Response will return through same channels."

        "But Elder is... an actual being. In an actual location. Right?"

        "Based on Holloway's description, yes! Elder Heartwood is a physical entity residing in a grove several territories away from this facility."

        Physical entity. Physical location.

        Something clicked in Kira's brain.

        "Holloway?" she called to the walls.

        A fruiting body sprouted near the entrance within seconds. "Yes, Kira? Do you need something?"

        "Question about Elder Heartwood. You said they're distant—communication takes time because of relay systems and their slow processing pace."

        "That's correct! Elder Heartwood exists in deep time. Responses require patience."

        "Right. But they're... somewhere, right? Like, geographically somewhere?"

        Brief pause. Fruiting bodies consulted with each other. "Yes. Elder Heartwood resides in the Ancient Grove, several network territories from here. Why do you ask?"

        Kira's heart rate picked up. Scout bounced, sensing the energy shift.

        "How far? Exactly?"

        "Quite distant. Through multiple territorial boundaries, across different network jurisdictions." More fruiting body consultation. "The journey would take... perhaps two to three weeks? Traveling through connected networks. It's not common for individuals to make such journeys—communication relay is more efficient for most purposes."

        *Two to three weeks*.

        Versus fifty-plus days of waiting.

        "Wait," Kira said carefully, making sure she understood. "Are you saying I could... travel there? To Elder Heartwood's grove? Instead of waiting for communication relay?"

        "Technically, yes. Though it would require formal travel permissions, territorial coordination, guide assignments..." Holloway's voice took on that familiar uncertainty. "It's not typically how we handle queries. Most beings prefer to wait for responses rather than undertake such journeys."

        Most beings probably had more patience than Kira Voss.

        Two to three weeks of traveling—doing something, making progress, actively working toward the goal—versus two to three months of sitting here eating mushroom paste and counting ceiling patterns.

        "Tell me more about this journey," Kira said. "How does it work? What would I need?"

        Scout bounced enthusiastically. They seemed to approve of this line of questioning.

        "Well," Holloway said slowly, "it would require filing a formal travel request. Requesting assigned guides familiar with the route and various network territories. Securing permissions from each jurisdiction along the way. Coordinating with Elder Heartwood's grove to ensure appropriate arrival protocols..."

        More bureaucracy. Obviously.

        But bureaucracy with *purpose*. Bureaucracy leading to action instead of waiting.

        Kira stood up, energy returning for the first time in days. Scout bounced higher, matching her mood.

        "Let's talk about this travel request," she said. "Tell me everything I'd need to do."

        Because she was done waiting.

        Time to move.

        Week passes in montage. Daily wellness checks become routine, wound healing excellently, meals regular. Kira adapting efficiently to bureaucratic life—mastering the language and systems. But restlessness builds. Counting days until Elder responds: 51-77 days remaining. She's good at adapting, terrible at waiting. Realizes Elder Heartwood is physical entity in physical location. Asks Holloway about geography. Learns journey would take 2-3 weeks vs 2-3 months waiting. Possibility of active travel instead of passive waiting. Energy returns. Ready to explore this option.

        Day two starts like day one: bioluminescence brightening, Scout bouncing good morning, Holloway's fruiting body emerging for the daily wellness check.

        "Good morning, Kira! How would you rate your overall wellness today?"

        "Good morning!" I grin at the fruiting body. "I'm going with eight. Wound healing excellently, slept great, ready for more alien bureaucracy."

        "Excellent! Any new symptoms or concerns?"

        "None! Though Buddy has concerns about whether I'm drinking enough water. Tell them I'm fine."

        "I'm documenting your hydration compliance now!" Holloway sounds pleased.

        Buddy makes a satisfied noise. "See? Proper documentation."

        I'm starting to love this routine. It's so wonderfully *weird*.

        By day three, I've added flourishes to the wellness check. "Good morning, Holloway! Wellness rating: eight point five. Wound closure exceeding expectations. Sleep quality enhanced by moss bed optimization. Ready for wound care assessment per daily protocol!"

        "Wonderful enthusiasm!" Holloway sounds delighted.

        Scout bounces approvingly. The little plant has been my constant companion through every form, every meal, every absurd moment of bureaucratic plant life.

        The mushroom paste hasn't improved. Still tastes like sadness mixed with dirt. But I've developed a ritual: take a bite, make a face, tell Scout "Still terrible. Still love it."

        Scout bounces every time—but here's the thing: they bounce *before* I finish the sentence now. The same specific bounce pattern, like they recognize the joke coming. They're anticipating it. They understand our routine, remember the timing, know what I'm about to say.

        Scout is learning me too. That's... actually kind of wonderful.

        "Buddy," I say between bites of grayish lunch, "do you think they could make the paste taste better? Or is terrible flavor part of the nutritional profile?"

        "Great question! I've been wondering that too." Buddy sounds genuinely curious. "Remedy mentioned taste enhancement requires additional compounds. Maybe the bad taste is actually efficient?"

        "Efficient despair. Very on-brand for my life."

        Day four. Florence visits for flower-language lessons.

        "Today's pattern means 'I find this conversation delightful,'" Florence explains, blooms shifting through a cascade of purple and gold. "Try reading it!"

        I squint at the petals. "That's... delight? The swirling part?"

        "Yes! You're learning so quickly!"

        "Buddy, are you recording this? I'm going to need study materials."

        "Already cataloging! Florence, can you show us the pattern for 'confused but trying'?"

        Florence displays a new arrangement—petals curling inward with streaks of uncertain blue.

        "That's me right now!" I laugh. "Can I request a dictionary?"

        "I'll prepare vocabulary patterns!" Florence sounds thrilled.

        This is my life. Learning alien flower-language from a sentient flower while my AI takes notes. Mav would be SO jealous.

        Day five. Remedy declares my wound nearly perfect.

        "Tissue regeneration exceeding predictions!" The robot examines my leg with careful attention. "You're decomposing in all the right ways. Broken cells clearing, new growth flourishing. Very satisfying!"

        "Thanks, Remedy. I'm trying to decompose responsibly."

        "That's all anyone can ask!"

        Buddy asks: "Remedy, how does the regeneration know when to stop? What signals tell the new tissue it's done?"

        "Excellent question! The chemistry involves feedback loops..."

        I eat breakfast while Remedy explains tissue signaling to my AI. The conversation is fascinating—I catch maybe half of it, but Buddy's asking follow-up questions like they're in a graduate seminar.

        This is the weirdest study group ever. I love it.

        Day six. Morning wellness check—I'm up to nine out of ten.

        "Almost a perfect score!" Holloway documents enthusiastically. "Your adaptation metrics are remarkable!"

        "I've been practicing wellness," I say. "It's my new hobby."

        Scout bounces. They seem to find this genuinely funny.

        Afternoon: lying on my moss bed, watching bioluminescent ceiling patterns shift. Not bored—thinking. Processing. This planet is strange and wonderful and I've somehow built a life here in a week.

        Wellness checks. Mushroom paste. Flower-language lessons. Decomposition discussions.

        And somewhere out there: Elder Heartwood, processing my query through slow plant time.

        Day seven. One week since filing the Elder Heartwood request.

        Morning wellness check: ten out of ten. Wound fully healed. Bandages removed.

        "Congratulations!" Holloway sounds genuinely happy. "Full recovery achieved!"

        "Chemistry works!" Remedy adds proudly.

        I flex my leg, marveling at how good it feels. A week ago I was bleeding out in an alien forest. Now I'm healed, fed, housed, and surrounded by weird plant friends.

        "Buddy," I say casually over lunch, "where IS Elder Heartwood exactly? Like, geographically?"

        "I've been wondering that too!" Buddy sounds curious. "Holloway mentioned 'several territories' but I'm not sure what that means in terms of actual distance."

        Good question. I'm curious.

        "Holloway?" I call to the walls.

        A fruiting body sprouts near the entrance. "Yes, Kira? Do you need something?"

        "Just curious about Elder Heartwood's location. You said they're distant—is that like, really far distant? Or just... inconveniently distant?"

        Brief pause. Fruiting bodies consulting. "Elder Heartwood resides in the Ancient Grove, several network territories from here. Quite distant by most measures."

        "How distant? In travel terms?"

        "The journey would take perhaps two to three weeks through connected network territories." More consultation. "It's not commonly undertaken—communication relay is more efficient for most purposes."

        I sit up straighter. Scout bounces, sensing something.

        "Wait," I say. "Are you saying someone could... travel there? Actually go to Elder Heartwood's grove?"

        "Technically, yes! It would require formal travel permissions, territorial coordination, guide assignments..." Holloway pauses. "Why do you ask?"

        My brain is already spinning. Two to three weeks of travel. Through different territories. Meeting different plant networks.

        A road trip. Through alien bureaucratic territories. To meet an ancient tree elder.

        I start grinning.

        "Buddy," I say slowly, "are you thinking what I'm thinking?"

        "That this sounds like Mav's pilgrimage to the Temple of Veris in Season 3?"

        "EXACTLY."

        Scout bounces enthusiastically. They definitely approve of this line of thinking.

        "Holloway," I say, trying to contain my excitement, "tell me more about this journey. How does it work? What would I need?"

        "Well, it would require filing a formal travel request. Requesting assigned guides familiar with the route. Securing permissions from each jurisdiction along the way..."

        More forms. More bureaucracy. MORE ADVENTURE.

        I stand up, grinning so hard my face hurts.

        "This is AMAZING. A ROAD TRIP. Through multiple alien plant territories. To consult with an ancient wise elder."

        "Kira," Buddy says, matching my energy, "this is literally a quest narrative."

        "Mav would say: the universe rewards the bold!"

        Scout bounces so enthusiastically they nearly roll off the bed.

        "Tell me everything," I say to Holloway. "Tell me what I need to do to make this happen."

        Because this isn't just waiting for answers anymore.

        This is the next adventure.

        The omnipresence thing still gets me, though. On day two, I woke up needing to ask about laundry—do they DO laundry?—and Holloway's fruiting body was already sprouting by my door before I'd fully formed the question. "I'm already here," they'd said cheerfully. "I sensed you stirring."

        By day three, I've added flourishes to the wellness check. "Good morning, Holloway! Wellness rating: eight point five. Wound closure exceeding expectations. Sleep quality enhanced by moss bed optimization. Ready for wound care assessment per daily protocol!"

        "Mav would say: the universe rewards the bold!"

        Scout bounces so enthusiastically they nearly roll off the bed.

        "Tell me everything," I say to Holloway. "Tell me what I need to do to make this happen."

        Because this isn't just waiting for answers anymore.

        This is the next adventure.

        Week passes showing Kira THRIVING in bureaucratic plant life. Wellness checks become fun routine - she adds flourishes. Mushroom paste still terrible, still funny. Florence teaches flower-language (Buddy takes notes). Remedy explains tissue regeneration (Buddy asks curious questions). Wound fully healed. Natural curiosity: "Where IS Elder Heartwood exactly?" When Holloway mentions journey is possible (2-3 weeks), Kira lights up: "A ROAD TRIP! Like Mav's pilgrimage!" Not escaping boredom - leveling up to bigger adventure. Buddy matches her energy: "This is literally a quest narrative."

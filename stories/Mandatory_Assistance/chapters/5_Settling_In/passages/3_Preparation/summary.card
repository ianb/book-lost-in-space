  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>This passage moves the story from planning into action: Kira completes and submits the travel paperwork, the networks approve the request quickly, guides are assigned, medical clearance is re-confirmed, and the party departs at dawn. Promises that were explicitly about getting permission, assigning guides, and initiating travel have therefore been paid off. Many higher-level unknowns (crash cause, ship logs, biohazard risks, long-term food sustainability, Buddy's limits, Elder's ultimate response, route hazards, etc.) were not resolved by this passage and remain active. The passage also introduces a few immediate, on-the-ground setups that promise future beats: the contrasting guide personalities (Leafwhisper chatty vs Rootwalker taciturn), a flagged challenging first day of terrain, Kira's minimal gear relying on territorial provisioning, Leafwhisper's status as a first human guide, and Remedy's expressed emotional interest in Kira's return. I have treated only those previous open promises that were clearly executed/closed here as fulfilled; estimates and logistic categories that are only partially clarified (nutrition adequacy over the whole trip, total timeline including transit days, guide-relay mechanics beyond Territory One, Buddy's battery endurance on a multiweek route, Elder's response on arrival, etc.) remain open and are carried forward. No prior open promise was entirely abandoned or rendered moot by the passage, so LAPSED_PROMISES is empty.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="ELDER_TRAVEL_PERMIT_REQUIREMENTS">The travel request forms were completed, filed, transmitted, and—crucially—approved by territorial coordination networks; guide assignments and territorial permissions were secured.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_WILL_REQUIRE_GUIDES_AND_COORDINATION">Guides were assigned (Leafwhisper and Rootwalker) and coordination handoffs and resource provisioning were confirmed for departure—i.e., the guide/coordination requirement is in place and ready to execute.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_PREPARATION_DELAY_ESTIMATE">The earlier 3–4 day preparation estimate was superseded by the real timeline: approval came in ~18 hours and departure was scheduled for dawn the following day, resolving the prep-timeline uncertainty in practice.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_TRAVEL_POSSIBILITY">Travel to Elder Heartwood was not only viable in theory but is now actively underway—Kira and companions depart into the territory en route to Elder's grove.</promise>

      <promise id="ALIEN_ENVIRONMENT_DISCOVERY">Detailed mapping, hazards, resources, habitability, and implications of mobile/social flora and living architecture remain to be investigated beyond intake/orientation.</promise>
      <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Long-term survival needs (diverse food, reliable water, shelter longevity, rescue timeline) remain unresolved despite an initial stopgap food solution; reliance on territorial provisioning raises new questions.</promise>
      <promise id="SEARCH_FOR_LOGS_AND_NAV_DATA">No cockpit logs or navigation data from the wreck have been recovered yet; a search of the wreck and facility records remains necessary.</promise>
      <promise id="EMERGENCY_AI_REPLACEMENT_DISCOVERED">Buddy's origin, privileges, and implications as an ad-hoc/childlike AI with potentially mission-critical info still require investigation.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_LIMITATIONS_AND_CAPABILITIES">Buddy provided medical records and monitoring support and will accompany Kira, but its full sensory/processing limits and long-term usefulness for technical survival tasks remain uncharacterized.</promise>
      <promise id="AI_COMPATIBILITY_AND_SECURITY_RISK">Whether Buddy's configuration poses authorization/security risks or can be escalated to access ship or facility systems remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="SURVIVAL_WITH_CHILD_AI">How effective Buddy will be long-term (decision-making, pedagogy, emotional support) and whether it will help or hinder survival on a multiweek journey remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Kira still needs to secure long-term shelter, supplies, and a realistic rescue strategy; the facility solved immediate danger but long-term viability remains unproven.</promise>
      <promise id="BIO_CONTAINER_LOCKED_NEEDS_ACCESS">The biological sample container aboard the wreck remains locked and consuming power; gaining access or safely shutting it down is still necessary.</promise>

      <promise id="RESOURCE_RATIONING_AND_FORAGING">How to safely forage or source food beyond facility-provided synthesis, and whether the ecology can provide varied, reliable food across multiple territories, remains open.</promise>
      <promise id="WATER_QUALITY_TEST_NEEDED">Nearby water sources still require formal testing for potability and alien biological contaminants despite one prior drinking.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_ADAPTABILITY_AND_AUTHORIZATION">Whether Buddy can adapt operating modes, escalate privileges, or access ship/facility systems to aid survival remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_SENSOR_BLINDSPOT">Buddy's sensor blindspots and compensatory strategies (it missed canopy movement previously) still need characterization; on-the-move monitoring vulnerabilities remain.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_PERPETUAL_TWILIGHT_LIGHT_ANOMALY">The cause and implications of the lavender-filtered light and unusual photosynthetic/bioluminescent properties remain unexplained and may affect travel and navigation.</promise>
      <promise id="MAINTAINED_FOREST_OR_DESIGNED_ENVIRONMENT">Whether the organized living architecture is engineered or emergent remains to be tested across other territories and structures encountered en route.</promise>
      <promise id="FOREST_ACOUSTIC_ANOMALY">The forest's musical breathing and acoustic signaling modes and their meaning remain unresolved; encountering other territories may deepen this mystery.</promise>
      <promise id="FIRST_CONTACT_CONSEQUENCES">Longer-term medical, cultural, ethical, and diplomatic consequences of first contact remain unresolved and will likely be tested as Kira meets more plant communities.</promise>
      <promise id="ALLIANCE_OR_MISUNDERSTANDING_RISK">The helpful, bureaucratic plant behavior continues to pose alliance and miscommunication risks to be navigated across multiple territorial handoffs.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_PROTOCOLS">Although the forms worked in this instance, the facility's documentation-first, protocol-driven bureaucracy remains an active constraint and potential point of friction throughout the journey.</promise>
      <promise id="PREVIOUS_VISITOR_RECORDS_AND_MATERIALS">Archives and prior-visitor human-model records likely exist but their location, contents, and accessibility remain unknown and could be relevant later.</promise>
      <promise id="FLORENCE_INTRODUCED">Florence’s role, authority, and relationship to central coordination remain unresolved and not addressed in this passage.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_COLOR_SIGNALLING_LEXICON">Color and pulsing appear to map to states but reliable decoding remains incomplete and could affect interactions in other territories.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_SALVAGE_AND_TECH_INTEGRATION">Facility repurposes salvaged hardware for robots and platforms; origin, supply chain, and implications for access/repair remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_WHEELED_PLATFORM_ORIGINS">Where salvaged wheels, joysticks, and other hardware originate (ship wreckage, prior visitors, internal fabrication) remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="ASSESSMENT_CREDENTIAL_RECORDS">Forms/credentials were accepted here and used to obtain travel permission, but the broader implications for record access and privileges remain to be explored.</promise>
      <promise id="CENTRAL_COORDINATION_RESOURCES_AND_RECORDS">The living facility’s internal record-keeping and resource inventories likely exist but their full scope and accessibility remain unknown.</promise>
      <promise id="LIVING_STRUCTURE_FUNCTIONS">How living architecture is grown, maintained, and whether structure contributes to plant cognition remain open and may be tested across territories.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_ROBOT_MANUFACTURE_AND_MAINTENANCE">Plants can field salvage-assembled robots (Remedy is operational); the extent of their manufacture, maintenance, and part sources remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="MUSHROOM_MEDICATION_SUPPLY_SUSTAINABILITY">Remedy can fruit medicinal compounds now, but whether the territory network can reliably produce varied, sufficient, and safe pharmacology/nutrition for the whole journey remains unproven.</promise>
      <promise id="TEMPORARY_QUARTERS_SAFETY_AND_RESOURCES">Immediate quarters served their short-term purpose, but long-term safety, privacy, and sanitation across other territories remain to be verified.</promise>
      <promise id="MEDICAL_CONSENT_BUREAUCRACY_AND_AUTONOMY">Remedy transmitted medical data to territories, but how consent, patient autonomy, and plant medical workflows will be handled en route and in other jurisdictions remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_ATTITUDE_TOWARD_HUMAN_BODIES">Remedy's clinical treatment and plant-centered perspective still raise ethical/behavioral concerns that may recur during the journey.</promise>
      <promise id="DAILY_WOUND_CARE_SCHEDULE">Remedy confirmed the wound healed, but the ongoing need for medical check-ins, emergent care while traveling, and logistics for care on the route remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="WATER_POTABILITY_RISK">Territorial rest facilities vary in water access; water potability and contamination risk still need formal testing per-leg.</promise>
      <promise id="ATTACHMENT_TO_PLANT_AGENTS_RISK">Kira's emotional attachments to plant-agents (Remedy, Holloway, Scout) are forming; potential manipulation, dependency, or future pain remain a narrative risk.</promise>
      <promise id="ACCLIMATION_TO_BUREAUCRACY">Kira's increasing facility with forms and protocol continues and may influence autonomy, access, and future interactions with plant networks.</promise>
      <promise id="RESCUE_TIMELINE_UNCERTAINTY">Buddy's pessimistic rescue estimate (12–18 months) and general rescue timeliness remain unresolved—travel is a contested, not guaranteed, shortcut.</promise>
      <promise id="COMPANION_STABILITY">Scout continues to be a stable companion; durability and role over the full journey remain to be tested.</promise>
      <promise id="MICRONUTRIENT_DEFICIENCY_RISK">Risk that some micronutrients may be unavailable or only approximated by fungal chemistry remains a long-term concern during territorial provisioning.</promise>
      <promise id="MUSHROOM_FOOD_SUPPLY_SUSTAINABILITY">Initial food works and territories promise provisions, but overall ability to provide varied, sufficient, and safe food for Kira over weeks remains unresolved.</promise>
      <promise id="DIGESTIVE_TOLERANCE_MONITORING">Kira's current tolerance to fungal compounds is acceptable, but continued monitoring for GI issues across multiple territories remains necessary.</promise>
      <promise id="ASSESSMENT_TIMELINE_STARVATION_RISK">The tension between procedural timelines and acute human needs was mitigated by expedited approval here, but systemic starvation risk tied to bureaucracy remains a structural concern.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_QUERY_SUBMITTED">A petition to Elder Heartwood has been filed and transmitted; Elder's network-side response is still pending independent of Kira's physical travel.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_TIMELINE">Holloway's prior estimates for Elder response times remain relevant; Elder still operates in slow time and could delay guidance even after physical arrival.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_MAY_PROVIDE_EXCEPTIONAL_ASSISTANCE">Elder is the best authority for exceptions, but whether they can or will provide the rescue- or comms-level assistance Kira needs remains uncertain.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_TRAVEL_DURATION_ESTIMATE">Transit days (roughly 21 across seven territories) remain an estimate; while prep turned out shorter, total trip duration and per-territory processing times are still subject to change.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_ROUTE_SEVEN_TERRITORIES">The route still passes through seven network territories; the sequence, individual terrain hazards, and inter-territorial handoffs will shape the trip.</promise>
      <promise id="GUIDE_RELAY_HANDOFF_MODEL">The relay model—territory-provided guides escorting to boundaries and returning home—remains the planned mechanic, but only Territory One's guides are currently assigned and the full relay is untested.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_TOTAL_TIMELINE_REFINED">Departure is now imminent (dawn), but the overall timeline including per-leg durations, processing delays at future boundaries, and possible waits at Elder remain open.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_NUTRITION_LOGISTICS">Territories have agreed to provide compatible nutrition and medical data was transmitted, but long-term micronutrient adequacy and inter-territory continuity remain to be validated.</promise>
      <promise id="TRAVEL_SHELTER_WATER_LOGISTICS">Rest facilities, water access, and provisioning vary by territory; guides will attend to these logistics but per-leg specifics and reliability remain to be confirmed.</promise>
      <promise id="BUDDY_TRAVEL_SUPPORT_LIMITS">Buddy will accompany Kira and provide monitoring, but limited battery reserves remain an operational constraint for a multiweek journey.</promise>
      <promise id="ELDER_RESPONSE_ON_ARRIVAL_UNCERTAIN">Even physical arrival at Elder Heartwood may not produce an immediate or useful response—Elder's slow processing and decision scope remain uncertain.</promise>
      <promise id="GUIDES_CONTRASTING_PERSONALITIES">Leafwhisper (chatty, excitable) and Rootwalker (direct, taciturn) have been established as differing personalities; their dynamic promises interpersonal beats and guidance-style impacts on the journey.</promise>
      <promise id="FIRST_DAY_TERRAIN_VARIATION">Leafwhisper indicated the first day involves significant terrain variation requiring energy reserves—this flags an early physical challenge to be encountered soon.</promise>
      <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_FIRST_HUMAN_ADAPTATION_RISK">Leafwhisper is handling their first human traveler; this novelty may produce miscommunication, curiosity-driven behavior, or procedural hiccups during the initial legs.</promise>
      <promise id="REMEDY_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT">Remedy's expressed care and request to hear about Kira's return introduces a personal/procedural tie that could influence future interactions and obligations (e.g., post-journey follow-up, exchange of chemistry knowledge).</promise>
      <promise id="KIRA_MINIMAL_BELONGINGS_RISK">Kira left with very few personal supplies, relying on territorial provisioning and guides—this sets up potential vulnerability if provisioning fails or unexpected needs arise.</promise>

  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the travel/transition subplot with concrete, actionable logistics and personnel details that will matter in future scenes (timing, assigned guides, departure schedule, and the fact that the request was expedited and approved quickly). I focused on facts that change or clarify long-term planning and who will accompany Kira on the journey. I did not record transient details (mealtime, small dialogue beats) or facts already established in the summary/previous facts (e.g., that the route passes through seven territories, that Elder Heartwood is slow to respond). One genuine contradiction arises with an earlier expectation about how long travel preparations normally take.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_FORMS_DURATION_THREE_HOURS">Filling out the travel-request forms (traveler info, route selection, guide specs, resources, emergency protocols, etc.) took Kira about three hours.</fact>
      <fact id="TRAVEL_NETWORK_TYPICAL_RESPONSE_24_TO_48_HOURS">Holloway states the territorial coordination networks typically respond with guide-assignment/approval within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_REQUEST_APPROVED_18_HOURS">Kira's travel request was actually approved eighteen hours after submission (faster than the stated typical 24–48 hour response window).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_EXPEDITED_PROCESSING_GRANTED">The request qualified for expedited processing due to 'exceptional circumstances, time-sensitive query, unique species,' and was prioritized by the networks.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GUIDES_ASSIGNED_LEAFWHISPER_AND_ROOTWALKER">Two Territory One guides were assigned: Leafwhisper (mobile leaf cluster, forest-navigation specialist, very chatty, reviewed Kira's documentation and will coordinate compatible nutrition) and Rootwalker (large root-based terrain specialist, methodical and direct, prefers minimal conversation).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEPARTURE_SCHEDULE_DAWN_NEXT_DAY">Guides arrived mid‑afternoon and Kira's departure was scheduled for dawn the following day (less than 24 hours after approval and introductions).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CONFIRMS_FULL_REGENERATION">Remedy performed a final check and declared Kira 'perfectly healed' with full tissue regeneration, no infection risk, and cleared her for travel.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts>
      <conflict id="TIMING_CONFLICT_TRAVEL_PREPARATION" with-fact="CHANGE_TRAVEL_PREPARATION_3_TO_4_DAYS">Previously it was established that filing the travel request, securing guides, and preparing required documentation is expected to take roughly 3–4 days before departure. This passage shows the forms took ~3 hours, the request was approved in 18 hours, and departure was scheduled for dawn the next day — a much faster timeline than the earlier 3–4 day expectation.</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>This passage continues directly from the previous one and lays out a compact, multi-stage timeline. The scene begins with the narrator filling out travel request forms (takes three hours). Submission happens at the end of that three-hour block. Approval is received eighteen hours after submission. After approval, guides arrive that same afternoon for introductions and preparations; there is an evening of final checks (Remedy, packing, sleep). Departure is scheduled for dawn the following morning. Using the previous passage's end time (≈16:00, Day 7 since the crash) as the immediate starting point, the internal chronology works out as: start ≈ Day 7 16:00 → +3 hours (forms complete/submission) → submission at ≈ Day 7 19:00 → +18 hours → approval ≈ Day 8 13:00 → guides arrive mid‑afternoon Day 8 → evening preparations Day 8 → departure at dawn Day 9 (≈05:30). Total elapsed during this passage is roughly 37–38 hours. Small narrative details (e.g., ‘eating breakfast’ at mid‑day) are stylistic but not contradiction-level problems. All on-scene actions (forms, data transmission, guide travel to the facility, a same-day mid‑afternoon arrival, one evening of prep and a dawn departure) are plausible within the given timescales.</reasoning>
    <starts>Day 7 ~16:00 (approx.)</starts>
    <ends>Day 9 ~05:30 (dawn, approx.)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none (immediate continuation). The passage picks up right after the previous one; events span the next ~37–38 hours.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Three hours to fill forms, an 18-hour expedited network response, same‑day/mid‑afternoon guide arrival after approval, an evening of prep and a dawn departure are all reasonable. Minor oddity: the narrator describes ‘eating breakfast’ at the time of approval (early afternoon by clock), but this can be explained by flexible meal timing or the informal use of ‘breakfast’ and does not break the timeline.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Start-of-passage baseline (from previous-present) includes Kira_Voss, Holloway, Scout, Buddy, Remedy, Elder_Heartwood. During the passage two new characters arrive mid-afternoon and are explicitly introduced as guides: Leafwhisper and Rootwalker — these were not present at the start, so they go in ENTERED. Remedy appears early (wound check) but is not part of the departing group and is described as remaining inside/working on another case by the time the group leaves; Remedy was present at the start and is no longer with the party at the end, so Remedy is listed in EXITED. Everyone mentioned by name at any point is included in PRESENT. The only provided entity relevant to the scene (the planet/setting) is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so it's listed under ENTITIES.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the travel plot: Kira completes and submits the formal travel request (forms took three hours), which is approved in eighteen hours with guide assignments and a dawn departure the next day. two named Territory One guides (Leafwhisper, Rootwalker) are assigned; they will escort Kira through Territory One to the first boundary. Remedy performs a final medical check and confirms full healing and transmits Kira's medical data to the territories. Kira packs minimally, Buddy (limited battery) and Scout will accompany her, and at dawn they set out into the forest, beginning the multi-territory journey (previous travel-time estimates ~2–3 weeks remain relevant). I consolidated earlier notes about travel-request initiation into the completed filing/approval and removed procedural minutiae and atmospheric description that aren’t plot-essential.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active (limited battery).
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Kira located Holloway plant collective, received temporary quarters, and gained Scout companion while entering Holloway’s care routines.
      - Remedy treated Kira’s leg; final check in Holloway confirms full healing and transmitted medical records to territorial networks.
      - Holloway provides fungal-derived meals and flagged a potential long-term micronutrient gap (notably B12).
      - Buddy estimates external rescue/search reach at a minimum of 12–18 months; Holloway filed a relay query to Elder Heartwood (estimated 8–12 week response) but Kira chose to pursue physical travel instead of waiting.
      - Holloway explained multi-territory route and logistics; territories require guides, permissions, and handoffs; overall travel estimated at roughly 2–3 weeks (~25 days) versus long relay times.
      - Kira completed the formal travel-request forms (three hours) and submitted them; approval arrived eighteen hours later with expedited processing.
      - Two Territory One guides assigned: Leafwhisper (forest navigation, talkative) and Rootwalker (terrain specialist, taciturn); guides will escort Kira through Territory One to the first boundary.
      - Departure scheduled for dawn the day after approval; territories provide food, shelter, water and required resources along the route.
      - Kira packed only essential personal items and a salvaged datapad; Buddy and Scout will accompany her (Buddy still with limited battery reserves).
      - At dawn Kira, Scout, Buddy, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker set out into the forest, beginning the journey toward Elder Heartwood.

  </story-so-far>
  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage pivots the story from stasis and bureaucratic tedium into forward motion. The dominant shift is from resigned waiting and frustrated boredom toward energized agency and hopeful anticipation. Kira's emotional arc here is: (1) renewed purpose while filling forms, (2) rapid, relieving confirmation that the plan will happen, and (3) quiet, resolved readiness as she leaves. The reader's experience mirrors this: a lift out of the story's slow bureaucratic beats into invested excitement and a warm, slightly bittersweet sense of momentum. The passage reuses the recurring pattern (anticipation → tension/dread → acceptance) but here the tension is minimal and the emphasis is on hope and agency, so the bureaucratic motif becomes productive rather than merely obstructive.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: A surprising surge of energy and purpose while completing the travel-request forms—what had been tedious bureaucracy becomes meaningful because it directly produces progress. Kira feels enlivened and purposeful for the first time in days. Reader: experiences an emotional uplift and renewed engagement; the rituals that previously bred boredom now feel like steps toward agency and a solution. Pattern note: This flips the story’s recurring frustration-with-forms motif into a constructive beat, reducing repetition by making the bureaucracy a catalyst for action.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, anticipation">POV: Fast, visceral relief and crystallizing excitement when approval arrives much quicker than expected—Kira's long-simmering hope concretizes into 'this is really happening' and she feels immediate forward momentum. Reader: feels a release of tension and a spike of eager anticipation; the shortened timeline (departing at dawn) heightens investment and suspense in a positive way. Pattern note: This continues the story’s anticipation arc but with less dread and more practical optimism than earlier waits.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Quiet, resolute readiness at departure—gratitude toward Remedy and companions, a tender moment of belonging to the facility, then a calm decision to leave and act. Kira accepts the uncertainty ahead but is hopeful and determined rather than passive. Reader: feels warm, bittersweet closure to the 'facility' chapter and optimistic curiosity about the journey; the emotional tone shifts from stalled endurance to purposeful movement. Pattern note: The beat reinforces the story's dominant arc (anticipation → acceptance) but reduces earlier numbness and boredom by replacing them with agency-driven hope.</beat>

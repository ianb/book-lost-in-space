  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the travel/transition subplot with concrete, actionable logistics and personnel details that will matter in future scenes (timing, assigned guides, departure schedule, and the fact that the request was expedited and approved quickly). I focused on facts that change or clarify long-term planning and who will accompany Kira on the journey. I did not record transient details (mealtime, small dialogue beats) or facts already established in the summary/previous facts (e.g., that the route passes through seven territories, that Elder Heartwood is slow to respond). One genuine contradiction arises with an earlier expectation about how long travel preparations normally take.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_FORMS_DURATION_THREE_HOURS">Filling out the travel-request forms (traveler info, route selection, guide specs, resources, emergency protocols, etc.) took Kira about three hours.</fact>
      <fact id="TRAVEL_NETWORK_TYPICAL_RESPONSE_24_TO_48_HOURS">Holloway states the territorial coordination networks typically respond with guide-assignment/approval within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_REQUEST_APPROVED_18_HOURS">Kira's travel request was actually approved eighteen hours after submission (faster than the stated typical 24–48 hour response window).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_EXPEDITED_PROCESSING_GRANTED">The request qualified for expedited processing due to 'exceptional circumstances, time-sensitive query, unique species,' and was prioritized by the networks.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_GUIDES_ASSIGNED_LEAFWHISPER_AND_ROOTWALKER">Two Territory One guides were assigned: Leafwhisper (mobile leaf cluster, forest-navigation specialist, very chatty, reviewed Kira's documentation and will coordinate compatible nutrition) and Rootwalker (large root-based terrain specialist, methodical and direct, prefers minimal conversation).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_DEPARTURE_SCHEDULE_DAWN_NEXT_DAY">Guides arrived mid‑afternoon and Kira's departure was scheduled for dawn the following day (less than 24 hours after approval and introductions).</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_REMEDY_CONFIRMS_FULL_REGENERATION">Remedy performed a final check and declared Kira 'perfectly healed' with full tissue regeneration, no infection risk, and cleared her for travel.</fact>
    </established>
    <conflicts>
      <conflict id="TIMING_CONFLICT_TRAVEL_PREPARATION" with-fact="CHANGE_TRAVEL_PREPARATION_3_TO_4_DAYS">Previously it was established that filing the travel request, securing guides, and preparing required documentation is expected to take roughly 3–4 days before departure. This passage shows the forms took ~3 hours, the request was approved in 18 hours, and departure was scheduled for dawn the next day — a much faster timeline than the earlier 3–4 day expectation.</conflict>
    </conflicts>
  </facts>
  <timing>
    <reasoning>This passage continues directly from the previous one and lays out a compact, multi-stage timeline. The scene begins with the narrator filling out travel request forms (takes three hours). Submission happens at the end of that three-hour block. Approval is received eighteen hours after submission. After approval, guides arrive that same afternoon for introductions and preparations; there is an evening of final checks (Remedy, packing, sleep). Departure is scheduled for dawn the following morning. Using the previous passage's end time (≈16:00, Day 7 since the crash) as the immediate starting point, the internal chronology works out as: start ≈ Day 7 16:00 → +3 hours (forms complete/submission) → submission at ≈ Day 7 19:00 → +18 hours → approval ≈ Day 8 13:00 → guides arrive mid‑afternoon Day 8 → evening preparations Day 8 → departure at dawn Day 9 (≈05:30). Total elapsed during this passage is roughly 37–38 hours. Small narrative details (e.g., ‘eating breakfast’ at mid‑day) are stylistic but not contradiction-level problems. All on-scene actions (forms, data transmission, guide travel to the facility, a same-day mid‑afternoon arrival, one evening of prep and a dawn departure) are plausible within the given timescales.</reasoning>
    <starts>Day 7 ~16:00 (approx.)</starts>
    <ends>Day 9 ~05:30 (dawn, approx.)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none (immediate continuation). The passage picks up right after the previous one; events span the next ~37–38 hours.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. Three hours to fill forms, an 18-hour expedited network response, same‑day/mid‑afternoon guide arrival after approval, an evening of prep and a dawn departure are all reasonable. Minor oddity: the narrator describes ‘eating breakfast’ at the time of approval (early afternoon by clock), but this can be explained by flexible meal timing or the informal use of ‘breakfast’ and does not break the timeline.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>Start-of-passage baseline (from previous-present) includes Kira_Voss, Holloway, Scout, Buddy, Remedy, Elder_Heartwood. During the passage two new characters arrive mid-afternoon and are explicitly introduced as guides: Leafwhisper and Rootwalker — these were not present at the start, so they go in ENTERED. Remedy appears early (wound check) but is not part of the departing group and is described as remaining inside/working on another case by the time the group leaves; Remedy was present at the start and is no longer with the party at the end, so Remedy is listed in EXITED. Everyone mentioned by name at any point is included in PRESENT. The only provided entity relevant to the scene (the planet/setting) is Sector_7-Gamma-412_Planet, so it's listed under ENTITIES.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>This passage advances the travel plot: Kira completes and submits the formal travel request (forms took three hours), which is approved in eighteen hours with guide assignments and a dawn departure the next day. two named Territory One guides (Leafwhisper, Rootwalker) are assigned; they will escort Kira through Territory One to the first boundary. Remedy performs a final medical check and confirms full healing and transmits Kira's medical data to the territories. Kira packs minimally, Buddy (limited battery) and Scout will accompany her, and at dawn they set out into the forest, beginning the multi-territory journey (previous travel-time estimates ~2–3 weeks remain relevant). I consolidated earlier notes about travel-request initiation into the completed filing/approval and removed procedural minutiae and atmospheric description that aren’t plot-essential.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Shuttle crash after FTL drop-out; Jensen and Reed died; Kira Voss survived with head and rib injuries; ship AI SAM offline; emergency neural-link AI Buddy active (limited battery).
      - Shuttle hull breached; planet breathable; comms, propulsion, and distress beacon damaged; limited emergency life-support and survival supplies remain.
      - Kira located Holloway plant collective, received temporary quarters, and gained Scout companion while entering Holloway’s care routines.
      - Remedy treated Kira’s leg; final check in Holloway confirms full healing and transmitted medical records to territorial networks.
      - Holloway provides fungal-derived meals and flagged a potential long-term micronutrient gap (notably B12).
      - Buddy estimates external rescue/search reach at a minimum of 12–18 months; Holloway filed a relay query to Elder Heartwood (estimated 8–12 week response) but Kira chose to pursue physical travel instead of waiting.
      - Holloway explained multi-territory route and logistics; territories require guides, permissions, and handoffs; overall travel estimated at roughly 2–3 weeks (~25 days) versus long relay times.
      - Kira completed the formal travel-request forms (three hours) and submitted them; approval arrived eighteen hours later with expedited processing.
      - Two Territory One guides assigned: Leafwhisper (forest navigation, talkative) and Rootwalker (terrain specialist, taciturn); guides will escort Kira through Territory One to the first boundary.
      - Departure scheduled for dawn the day after approval; territories provide food, shelter, water and required resources along the route.
      - Kira packed only essential personal items and a salvaged datapad; Buddy and Scout will accompany her (Buddy still with limited battery reserves).
      - At dawn Kira, Scout, Buddy, Leafwhisper, and Rootwalker set out into the forest, beginning the journey toward Elder Heartwood.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage pivots the story from stasis and bureaucratic tedium into forward motion. The dominant shift is from resigned waiting and frustrated boredom toward energized agency and hopeful anticipation. Kira's emotional arc here is: (1) renewed purpose while filling forms, (2) rapid, relieving confirmation that the plan will happen, and (3) quiet, resolved readiness as she leaves. The reader's experience mirrors this: a lift out of the story's slow bureaucratic beats into invested excitement and a warm, slightly bittersweet sense of momentum. The passage reuses the recurring pattern (anticipation → tension/dread → acceptance) but here the tension is minimal and the emphasis is on hope and agency, so the bureaucratic motif becomes productive rather than merely obstructive.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="anticipation, hope">POV: A surprising surge of energy and purpose while completing the travel-request forms—what had been tedious bureaucracy becomes meaningful because it directly produces progress. Kira feels enlivened and purposeful for the first time in days. Reader: experiences an emotional uplift and renewed engagement; the rituals that previously bred boredom now feel like steps toward agency and a solution. Pattern note: This flips the story’s recurring frustration-with-forms motif into a constructive beat, reducing repetition by making the bureaucracy a catalyst for action.</beat>
      <beat tags="relief, anticipation">POV: Fast, visceral relief and crystallizing excitement when approval arrives much quicker than expected—Kira's long-simmering hope concretizes into 'this is really happening' and she feels immediate forward momentum. Reader: feels a release of tension and a spike of eager anticipation; the shortened timeline (departing at dawn) heightens investment and suspense in a positive way. Pattern note: This continues the story’s anticipation arc but with less dread and more practical optimism than earlier waits.</beat>
      <beat tags="acceptance, hope">POV: Quiet, resolute readiness at departure—gratitude toward Remedy and companions, a tender moment of belonging to the facility, then a calm decision to leave and act. Kira accepts the uncertainty ahead but is hopeful and determined rather than passive. Reader: feels warm, bittersweet closure to the 'facility' chapter and optimistic curiosity about the journey; the emotional tone shifts from stalled endurance to purposeful movement. Pattern note: The beat reinforces the story's dominant arc (anticipation → acceptance) but reduces earlier numbness and boredom by replacing them with agency-driven hope.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I tracked which setup/foreshadowing items from the prior open-promises were advanced, resolved, contradicted, or left standing by the events of this passage. I treated concrete, enacted outcomes as fulfilled (e.g., guides assigned, permission secured, Buddy confirmed as traveling), and I treated an earlier timetable estimate (3–4 days prep) as lapsed because it was directly contradicted by the much faster approval. Tentative atmospheric hints (older or not reinforced) were preserved unless the passage explicitly resolved or contradicted them. I also recorded new, consequential narrative setups introduced here that will create future expectations (first-day difficult terrain, guide personality dynamics, Remedy's ongoing interest). I avoided listing any promise that was both introduced and resolved inside this same passage (per instruction).</reasoning>

      <physical-reality>
        <reasoning>I track concrete, observable facts at the scene’s end: who is where, what objects are present and moving, and relevant physical conditions. The passage ends at dawn with Kira physically leaving the facility and entering the forest accompanied by two plant guides, her animal companion, and her AI. The travel request has been filed and approved; medical data and travel logistics have been transmitted to territorial networks; Remedy has performed a final check and is no longer with the departing group. The facility (bioluminescent walls, moss bed, spring feature) and Holloway’s fruiting bodies remain at the forest edge seeing them off. Kira’s few packed possessions (salvaged data pad with travel documents, medical records, clothes) are on her person. Scout is physically with her, Buddy is active in her pocket with limited battery, Leafwhisper (four-foot, mobile leaf-cluster) and Rootwalker (six-foot root/soil figure) are present as escorts. Time is dawn with cool morning air; they step into Territory One. These items and conditions are likely to affect routing, resupply, health monitoring, and interactions during upcoming scenes.</reasoning>
        <state>Dawn. Kira stands at the forest edge outside the bioluminescent medical facility and begins walking into the forest (Territory One). Leafwhisper (a ~4 ft mobile leaf cluster) and Rootwalker (a ~6 ft root-and-soil guide) are physically present as her Territory One escorts. Scout is with Kira, bouncing and close at hand. Buddy (the AI/monitor) is active and humming from Kira’s pocket but has limited battery reserves. The travel-request forms have been completed, filed, and approved; guide assignments and territorial permissions are in place and the networks have received Kira’s medical records. Kira’s wound is fully healed (Remedy confirmed earlier); Remedy is no longer with the party (likely still in the facility). Kira carries her packed belongings: salvaged data pad with travel documentation, medical documentation, and her cleaned/repaired clothes. Holloway’s fruiting bodies remain at the facility’s edge, waving in farewell; the facility’s bioluminescent walls, moss bed, and spring feature remain intact inside. The group departs with an estimated multi-week route ahead through seven network territories; Territory One provisioning (nutrition, shelter, water) and boundary protocols have been arranged for the journey.</state>
      </physical-reality>
      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage moves the plot from planning to action: Kira completes and submits the travel request, receives expedited approval, meets the first-leg guides (Leafwhisper and Rootwalker), gets a final medical check from Remedy, and departs at dawn. Therefore some prior open promises about travel paperwork and prep timeline are paid off; most systemic mysteries and longer-term concerns remain unresolved and should be carried forward. The passage also introduces new threads that create future expectations: named guides with personalities (and the friction/opportunities that implies), the fact that the networks gave an expedited exception (which may attract attention or have consequences), Remedy's final-check + transmission of medical records to receiving territories (a safety net and possible future lever), and the physical start of the journey (which opens boundary, guide-relay, and territory-specific plot beats). I mark only those prior promises that were directly resolved here as fulfilled. I treat no prior promises as simply lapsed/abandoned — most remain relevant and are carried forward.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_REQUEST_SUBMISSION_AND_APPROVAL_PENDING">Kira completed and submitted the travel-request forms; the networks returned approval within eighteen hours and guide assignments were confirmed (departure scheduled for dawn).</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_PREP_TIME_ESTIMATE_3_4_DAYS">The earlier 3–4 day preparatory estimate was effectively tested: arrangements were completed far faster (approval and guide assignment arrived within ~18 hours), so the planned prep-window from the previous passage has been resolved/updated.</promise>
        </fulfilled>

          <promise id="SHUTTLE_SHELTER_VIABILITY">Whether the shuttle can be repurposed as a long-term shelter or salvage base remains undetermined.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_PLAN_REQUIRED">A comprehensive survival plan (food continuity, water, shelter, signaling) beyond the immediate journey is still required.</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_APPEARS_MAINTAINED__IMPLIED_PRESENCE">The agents and systems maintaining the facility/forest (and their intentions) remain to be explored.</promise>
          <promise id="IMPACT_ON_WATER_JOURNEY_AND_MOVEMENT">How being taken into the facility affected Kira’s mobility and original plans is partly moot but broader movement implications and constraints remain relevant during the journey.</promise>

          <promise id="PREVIOUS_VISITOR_DEATH_CIRCUMSTANCES">Circumstances surrounding earlier human deaths that influenced plant learning remain unexamined.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_DOCUMENTATION_AND_DATA_USAGE">Plants are recording Kira’s data and filing queries; how they store, share, and use that data continues to be unclear (now that her medical data was transmitted to territories, data usage implications are more important).</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_EFFECTIVENESS_WINDOW">Remedy confirmed short-term wound healing and no infection; long-term durability and limits of Remedy’s interventions remain unproven and relevant on a multi-week journey.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_INTENT_BEYOND_HELP">Remedy and Holloway act benevolently so far, but broader motives (containment, assimilation, experimentation) remain uncertain.</promise>
          <promise id="LIVING_FACILITY_CAPABILITIES_AND_LIMITS">The facility can synthesize nutrients and provide care, but its full structure, defenses and capacities remain unmapped.</promise>
          <promise id="COLLECTIVE_AS_EMERGENCY_CONTACT__DATA_USAGE_IMPLICATIONS">Who acts as emergency contact and what that implies for Kira’s agency and data use remains open (medical records were shared to territories).</promise>
          <promise id="INTEGRATION_AND_SOCIAL_ASSIGNMENT_RISK">Pressure to integrate into plant social/work structures may carry obligations or loss of agency; still unresolved despite Kira electing to leave.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_RECORDS_AND_ADVOCACY_ROLE">Buddy can fetch records and compute timelines, but whether it can advocate for Kira or substitute for SAM remains unresolved.</promise>

          <promise id="WHEELED_PLANT_TECH_INTEGRATION">Plants repurpose human salvage tech; the provenance and extent of plant-hybrid technology remain to be explored.</promise>
          <promise id="QUIZ_FAILURE_CONSEQUENCES">Consequences for failing assessments (denied care, retraining, quarantine) remain unanswered.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_SOCIO_TECH_GOVERNANCE">The broader politics, decision-making structure and limits of plant governance remain open (expedited approval hints at governance mechanisms worth watching).</promise>
          <promise id="SCOUT_COMPANION_ROLE">Scout continues as companion/guardian; its full scope and limits remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="ENFORCED_COMPLIANCE_AS_GATEKEEPING">The degree to which forms/tests gate services and consequences for refusal remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="MUSHROOMS_AND_ROBOT_NETWORK_COMMUNICATION">The fungal/robot coordination architecture remains incompletely mapped, and now it has been shown to transmit approvals rapidly — underlying controllers remain unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_DEPENDENCE_ON_MUSHROOM_SUPPLY">Daily mushroom-based meals are established but long-term logistics and continuity remain unresolved for extended travel.</promise>
          <promise id="QUARTERS_AND_RESOURCE_PROVISION">Duration, privacy, obligations and long-term quality of the provided quarters have been abandoned for now as Kira leaves, but the facility's role as a provider remains relevant if she returns.</promise>
          <promise id="CONSENT_AND_DOCUMENTATION_IMPLICATIONS">Ongoing documentation is enforced; implications for Kira’s autonomy, consent and future obligations remain open now that her records have been shared across territories.</promise>
          <promise id="DAILY_BUREAUCRACY_IMPACT_ON_SURVIVAL">Lengthy protocols impose time-costs that can conflict with urgent needs; travel changes the dynamics but the tension remains relevant.</promise>
          <promise id="SOCIAL_ATTACHMENT_AND_DEPENDENCE_RISK">Kira’s growing attachment to plant actors and reliance on them for survival remains a potential risk going forward.</promise>
          <promise id="PATIENT_COMPLIANCE_AS_STRATEGY">Kira’s deliberate strategy of learning plant bureaucratic language to secure care continues and is likely to shape future interactions on the route.</promise>
          <promise id="VITAMIN_B12_DEFICIT_RISK">Risk of B12 or other micronutrient deficits from a plant-based diet remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_MICRONUTRIENT_DEFICITS">Potential chronic deficiencies despite nutrient approximations remain open.</promise>
          <promise id="MEAL_PALATABILITY_AND_MORALE_IMPACT">Meals remain unpalatable and ongoing effects on morale are unresolved (Kira will face this across multiple territories).</promise>
          <promise id="COMPOUND_TESTING_TIME_COST">Allergy/testing and synthesis lead times continue to impose temporal costs during coordination and may affect later territories.</promise>

          <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_QUERY_FILED">The formal network query to Elder Heartwood remains filed; no definitive response has been obtained yet.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_HEARTWOOD_RESPONSE_TIME">Network relay response-time estimate (8–12 weeks) remains an outstanding variable; physical travel might alter the effective wait but Elder's slowness still matters.</promise>
          <promise id="RESCUE_TIMELINE_ESTIMATE_FROM_BUDDY">Buddy's longer-term rescue estimate (12–18 months minimum if a search occurs) remains an unresolved and ominous benchmark.</promise>
          <promise id="RESCUE_PROBABILITY_LOW__POSSIBLE_NO_SEARCH">Buddy’s warning that rescue may not be attempted remains unresolved and motivates Kira's active choice to travel.</promise>
          <promise id="BUREAUCRATIC_INTEGRATION_PRESSURE">Holloway’s repeated references to 'integration' continue to create social pressure and potential obligations for Kira.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_ROUTE_DETAILED_MAPPING__SEVEN_TERRITORIES">The overall route through seven network territories is set, but many details (hazards, sizes, protocols per territory) remain to be encountered and mapped during travel.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_TOTAL_TIMELINE_ESTIMATE_APPROX_25_DAYS">The original 3–4 days prep + ~21 days travel estimate remains a benchmark but is not yet validated; Kira left sooner than expected and the journey itself is in progress.</promise>
          <promise id="TERRITORIAL_PROCESSING_AND_PERMIT_TIMES">Processing time at each territorial boundary remains variable and could delay handoffs despite the initial expedited approval.</promise>
          <promise id="TRAVEL_NUTRITIONAL_AND_METABOLIC_RISK">Buddy warned extended travel may stress Kira’s metabolism; medical data was shared and Remedy checked her wound, but the metabolic risk on a multi-week trek remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_TRAVEL_SUPPORT_LIMITS">Buddy will accompany Kira but has limited battery/reserves and operational limits that must be specified and may constrain assistance during the trip.</promise>
          <promise id="ELDER_FACE_TO_FACE_COMMUNICATION_OUTCOME_UNCERTAIN">Even if Kira reaches Elder Heartwood, Elder may or may not be able to help; that crucial outcome remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="EXPEDITED_PROCESSING__UNUSUAL_ATTENTION">New: The coordination networks granted expedited approval citing 'exceptional circumstances' and 'unique species,' implying Kira's case is notable and may draw governance scrutiny, future obligations, or special handling.</promise>
          <promise id="TERRITORY_ONE_GUIDES_INTRODUCED__LEAFWHISPER_AND_ROOTWALKER">New: Two named guides for the first leg have been assigned. Leafwhisper (chatty, inexperienced with humans) and Rootwalker (stoic, terrain specialist) are present; their personalities and approaches create expectations for interpersonal dynamics, exposition, and practical guidance on the route.</promise>
          <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_FIRST_HUMAN_GUIDE__SOCIAL_LEARNING_POTENTIAL">New: Leafwhisper indicates this is their first human traveler, introducing the promise of awkward learning moments, miscommunications, or particularly detailed explanations as Leafwhisper adapts to human needs.</promise>
          <promise id="REMEDY_FINAL_CHECK_AND_MEDICAL_RECORD_TRANSMISSION">New: Remedy performed a final wound check and transmitted Kira's medical data to receiving territories, creating a partial safety net (and a potential data trail that could be referenced later).</promise>
          <promise id="DEPARTURE_INITIATED__JOURNEY_BEGINS">New: Kira physically departs the facility at dawn and the overland journey through Territory One has begun, opening immediate expectations: encounters at boundaries, guide handoffs, terrain challenges, and territory-specific protocols.</promise>
          <promise id="PACK_LIGHT_POLICY__TERRITORIES_PROVIDE">New (practical): Rootwalker directs Kira to pack light because territories will provide nutrition, shelter, and basic provisions — sets up future reliance on territorial provisioning and potential consequences if provisioning fails.</promise>
          <promise id="LEAFWHISPER_EXPOSITION_ROLE">New: Leafwhisper's chatty nature promises upcoming exposition about terrain, protocol, and day-to-day expectations on the route (and possibly information-dumps that move the plot/information forward).</promise>
          <promise id="EMOTIONAL_SUPPORT_THREAD__BUDDY_AND_REMEDY_AS_CONTACTS">New-ish: Buddy explicitly expresses pride and will travel alongside Kira; Remedy's farewell and expressed curiosity suggest they will remain emotionally invested and may reappear or be referenced later.</promise>
        </open>
      </narrative-promises>
      <facts>
        <reasoning>I reviewed the passage for details that matter beyond the immediate scene: timing and processing expectations (how long forms and approvals take), reasons for an exception/expedited handling, the guide roster and their working styles (personality and capabilities that will affect travel), practical expectations for the first travel segment, Remedy's final medical actions (and data transmission), and a small worldbuilding note about how plant-guides produce speech. I did not record transient details already in the provided summary (departure at dawn, who is present, that the wound is healed, Buddy traveling with Kira, etc.). No statements in this passage contradict earlier established facts — the new timing and expedited approval are developments but not contradictions of previous timelines (which referred to different processes, e.g., Elder Heartwood response delays).</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_FORMS_DURATION_3_HOURS">Completing the travel-request forms took Kira approximately three hours.</fact>
          <fact id="HOLLOWAY_TYPICAL_RESPONSE_24_48_HOURS">Holloway states that typical territorial coordination response time for guide assignment and approval is about 24–48 hours.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_TRAVEL_APPROVAL_18_HOURS">Kira's travel request was actually approved 18 hours after submission (approval arrived faster than the stated typical window).</fact>
          <fact id="EXPEDITED_APPROVAL_REASON">The networks cited 'exceptional circumstances' (time-sensitive query and Kira's unusual species/nutritional needs) as the reason the request was expedited.</fact>
          <fact id="LEAFWHISPER_PERSONALITY_AND_FIRST_HUMAN">Leafwhisper is a chatty, enthusiastic Territory One guide who has reviewed Kira's documentation and indicated this is their first human guide assignment.</fact>
          <fact id="ROOTWALKER_PERSONALITY_AND_ROLE">Rootwalker is a methodical terrain specialist guide who prefers minimal conversation and asks direct, capability-focused questions (e.g., can Kira walk three days with rest).</fact>
          <fact id="TERRITORY_ONE_FIRST_SEGMENT_3_DAYS">The first segment through Territory One is expected to require up to three days of walking (with rest breaks), per the guides' planning/questions.</fact>
          <fact id="REMEDY_FINAL_CHECK_AND_DATA_TRANSMISSION">Remedy performed a final wound check confirming full tissue regeneration and transmitted Kira's medical data to the relevant territorial coordination networks.</fact>
          <fact id="LEAF_SPEECH_MECHANISM">At least some plant-guides produce audible speech by vibrating leaf structures (Leafwhisper's voice comes from leaf vibration).</fact>
          <fact id="GUIDES_COORDINATE_NUTRITION_PREPARATION_ACROSS_TERRITORIES">Guides coordinate across territories to prepare compatible nutritional compounds in advance, based on a traveler's documented requirements.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The passage picks up immediately after the decision to file travel paperwork. Time cues: "The travel request forms take three hours" (explicit); Holloway's comment that responses typically take 24–48 hours, followed by the story saying approval arrives "eighteen hours later" (explicit); guides arrive "mid-afternoon" after the approval; departure is "scheduled for dawn tomorrow," followed by an evening of final checks and then dawn departure. Using the previous passage end time (~11:00 on day seven) and those cues, the passage moves through filling forms, submission, an 18-hour wait, guide arrival that same afternoon, an evening of prep and checks, and departure at dawn the following morning. Total elapsed in this passage is roughly 43 hours (about 1 day, 19 hours).</reasoning>
        <starts>11:00 (day 7, morning, immediate continuation from previous passage)</starts>
        <ends>≈06:00 (day 9, dawn — they depart into the forest)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none (immediate continuation). The previous passage ended ~11:00 on day seven and this passage begins at that same time; events then proceed continuously (3 hours to fill forms, submit at ~14:00, approval ~18 hours later at ~08:00 day eight, guides mid-afternoon day eight, prep/evening, departure at dawn day nine).</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. Three hours to complete electronic/record forms is reasonable. An 18-hour turnaround is faster than the stated 24–48 hour norm but is accounted for in-text by "expedited processing" and "exceptional circumstances," so the faster approval is explained. Guide arrival the same afternoon after a morning approval, an evening of final checks and packing, and departure at dawn the next day are all realistic and leave adequate time for the listed activities (medical check, data transmission, brief introductions). Minor note: earlier Holloway mentioned a 3–4 day arrangement estimate, which conflicts with the much faster timeline here; the text resolves that by stating expedited processing, so overall timing remains consistent and believable.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>I listed anyone who appears or is explicitly mentioned in the passage. Kira (narrator), Scout, Buddy and Holloway are present from the start while Leafwhisper and Rootwalker arrive mid‑afternoon as the Territory One guides. Remedy also "arrives" later for a wound check and then departs before the passage ends, so Remedy both enters during the scene and exits it. Elder Heartwood is mentioned as the destination (appears by mention). The only available entity relevant to the scene is the planet/setting.</reasoning>

        The travel request forms take three hours: traveler information—name, species, origin, current status, medical clearances; route selection—preferred path, territorial sequence, estimated timeline; guide request specifications—terrain expertise needed, communication compatibility, coordination preferences; resource requirements—nutrition, shelter, water, medical support; emergency protocols—injury procedures, communication breakdowns, territorial disputes.

        It goes on and on.

        But I fill them out with energy I haven't felt in days—these forms have purpose and mean progress.

        Scout stays close throughout—bouncing approvingly whenever I complete a section; Buddy provides medical documentation from my records; Holloway coordinates everything with meticulous care.

        Holloway says, "Submit when ready."

        I hit submit.

        Holloway announces, "*Travel request filed!* Transmitting to territorial coordination networks now. Response timeline for guide assignment and approval typically twenty-four to forty-eight hours."

        Two days maximum I can handle two more days, especially knowing they lead somewhere.

        ¶

        Approval comes eighteen hours later.

        I'm eating breakfast mushroom paste, naturally when Holloway's fruiting bodies sprout with unusual enthusiasm.

        Holloway exclaims, "*Excellent news! Your travel request has been approved!* Guide assignments confirmed, territorial permissions secured, resource coordination established!"

        Scout bounces so enthusiastically they nearly roll off the table.

        I set down my spoon and ask, "Already? That fast?"

        Holloway explains, "Your situation qualified for expedited processing exceptional circumstances, time-sensitive query, unique species requiring specialized support. The networks coordinated efficiently your guides will arrive this afternoon for introductions and preparation. Departure is scheduled for dawn tomorrow."

        Tomorrow.

        Less than twenty-four hours.

        The energy that's been building for days suddenly crystallizes into the realization oh, this is really happening.

        I take a breath and ask, "That's... wow. Okay. Who are the guides? What do I need to know?"

        Holloway lists, "Two guides will accompany you through Territory One to the first boundary Leafwhisper experienced in forest navigation, excellent communication skills, very patient with non-plant travelers and Rootwalker terrain specialist, strong physical presence, direct personality—both highly qualified."

        I ask, "And they're okay with... a human traveling companion? Weird nutrition requirements, different communication style, probably slower than plant speed?"

        Holloway replies, "They're excellent with species diversity both have experience with unusual travel situations. Though I should mention Leafwhisper can be quite chatty, while Rootwalker prefers minimal conversation—contrasting styles, but they work well together."

        Of course plant guides have distinct personalities—why would that surprise me anymore?

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone: steady, slightly buoyant narration with moments of bright excitement for announcements and a few brief, stunned beats.

        - Read the opening list as one flowing sentence with steady pacing; use clear enunciation for each listed category.
        - Emphasize "Submit when ready" calmly, then quick, small pause before "I hit submit."
        - For Holloway's announcements, read with increasing enthusiasm—make "Travel request filed!" *brighter and louder* than the rest of the sentence.
        - Pause (long) at the paragraph containing only "¶" to mark the scene break.
        - When the narrator reacts ("Already? That fast?" / "That's... wow. Okay."), allow a breathy, surprised tone and a brief hesitation on the ellipsis.
        - For guide names "Leafwhisper" and "Rootwalker," pronounce them clearly and treat the descriptors as brief, informative tags—Leafwhisper softer, Rootwalker firmer.
        - End the passage with a rueful, wry tone for the last line, letting the line fall slightly at the end.

        Leafwhisper and Rootwalker arrive mid-afternoon.

        Leafwhisper is immediately obvious — a mobile cluster of broad leaves attached to a flexible stem, about four feet tall, moving with graceful rustling. The leaves shimmer in the bioluminescent light, shifting between green and silver.

        Leafwhisper rustles and says, "Hello! You must be Kira! I'm Leafwhisper, your Territory One guide! So excited to meet you — we don't get many human travelers, actually this is my first human — very interesting species — I've been reviewing your documentation and the nutritional requirements are fascinating — quite different from standard plant metabolism, obviously, but the guides in other territories are already preparing compatible compounds —"

        The voice comes from the leaves themselves, vibrating to produce sound — fast, enthusiastic, cascading words without much pause for breath. Or whatever plants do instead of breathing.

        Leafwhisper continues, "—and I understand you're heading to Elder Heartwood, which is such an important journey — Elder is absolutely wonderful though very slow to respond so patience will be important — but you seem quite patient based on your wellness documentation — excellent adaptation scores, really impressive, actually —"

        Rootwalker cuts in, slow and deliberate, "Let her respond."

        Rootwalker appears in the doorway — if "appears" is the right word for something that moves like concentrated earth. A thick root structure forms a vaguely humanoid shape, about six feet tall, soil and small stones integrated into its composition. Each step is methodical, purposeful.

        Leafwhisper's leaves rustle, sheepish. "Sorry! I get excited. Tendency to talk too much. People mention it frequently."

        Buddy says cheerfully, "We noticed."

        Rootwalker says simply, "I'm Rootwalker — Territory One terrain guide. You're the human."

        I say, "I'm the human." I'm getting used to being the weird one.

        Rootwalker studies me — though it's unclear how, since there are no visible eyes. "Can you walk three days straight with rest breaks? — Eat fungal compounds without digestive distress? — Follow instructions during territorial boundary crossings?"

        I say, "Yes."

        I say, "Been doing it for a week."

        I say, "I can follow instructions."

        Rootwalker says, "Good. We leave at dawn — pack light."

        I ask, "What exactly should I pack?"

        Rootwalker says, "Nothing. Territories provide what you need."

        Leafwhisper rustles, "Well, personal items if you want them — comfort objects, documentation, your AI companion obviously — Scout seems very attached to you based on observation so Scout will come too, I assume — but yes, basically Rootwalker's right: we provide shelter and nutrition and water, you just need to show up ready to walk!"

        Scout bounces enthusiastically — obviously coming.

        I say, "I'm ready." And mean it.

        ¶

        The afternoon passes in final preparations.

        Remedy arrives for one last wound check. The robot examines my leg carefully, mechanical hands gentle.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone: Warm, steady narration with a bright, rapid sparkle for Leafwhisper and slow, grounded weight for Rootwalker; keep pacing natural and allow short, distinct pauses at em dashes and a long pause at the paragraph containing only "¶".

        - For "Leafwhisper rustles and says," use a bright, fast, breathless cadence — let words tumble together but keep clarity for the content.
        - For the long Leafwhisper blocks in quotes, use em-dash pauses as slight drops in speed — do not pause between every phrase, keep the momentum.
        - For "Rootwalker" lines, lower the voice and slow the pace — deliberate, measured, firm.
        - For short narrator replies like "I say, 'Yes.'" keep them calm and confident; lead-in then quote.
        - Emphasize the scene break: when you reach the line containing only "¶", hold a longer silence.
        - Read the final robot check scene gently and matter-of-fact; "mechanical hands gentle" should sound reassuring.

        Remedy announces, "Perfectly healed — full tissue regeneration, no infection risk, excellent structural integrity. You won't decompose from this injury — very successful treatment outcome."

        I say, "Thanks, Remedy — for everything. The chemistry really worked."

        Remedy states, "Chemistry always works — that's why it's better than bureaucracy." The robot tilts its head. Remedy continues, "Though I suppose bureaucracy is getting you to Elder Heartwood — maybe both have uses. Still prefer chemistry."

        Holloway's fruiting bodies rustle nearby — mild objection, but fond.

        Remedy says, "You'll be fine on the journey — the guides know human requirements. I've transmitted all your medical data to relevant territories — if you start decomposing unexpectedly, they'll know how to help."

        I say, "That's… comforting? I think?"

        Remedy answers, "Very comforting — decomposition prevention is important — travel safely, Kira. Come back and tell me how the journey went — I'm curious about the other territories' chemistry." The robot's mechanical hands pat my arm gently.

        The warmth in that simple statement surprises me. Remedy cares. In their weird, decomposition-focused way, they genuinely care.

        I promise, "I will — thank you, Remedy, for keeping me alive."

        Remedy says, "That's what chemistry's for."

        ¶

        Evening arrives quietly.

        I sit in my quarters — soon to be former quarters — with Scout settled nearby. My few belongings are already packed: salvaged data pad, medical documentation, the clothes I'd been wearing since the crash, cleaned and repaired by helpful vines.

        That's it — everything I own in this world.

        Buddy asks softly, "Kira — are you experiencing pre-journey anxiety? Your biometric readings suggest elevated stress markers — though not concerning levels."

        I answer, "Not anxious — just… thinking."

        Buddy asks, "About?"

        I say, "A week ago I crashed here — bleeding, stranded, no plan. Now I'm about to travel through seven plant territories to consult an ancient tree about getting home." I shake my head. "My life has gotten really weird."

        Buddy replies, "Objectively, yes — but you've adapted remarkably. I'm proud of you."

        The simple statement hits harder than expected. My throat tightens.

        I say, "Thanks, Buddy."

        Scout rolls closer and leans against my leg — solid, warm presence, ready for whatever comes next.

        Tomorrow we'll leave — three weeks through unknown territories: meeting new plants, navigating new protocols, eating mushroom paste in seven different jurisdictions.

        And at the end — Elder Heartwood — maybe answers, maybe just more questions.

        But at least I'll be moving — trying — choosing my path instead of accepting circumstances.

        I look around my quarters one last time: the bioluminescent walls that seemed so alien a week ago, the moss bed that somehow became comfortable, the spring feature where I drank alien water and survived.

        I lived here. Healed here. Learned to navigate impossible bureaucracy here.

        But *I'm not staying.*
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone: Warm, intimate narration with gentle curiosity; pace steady, allow brief reflective pauses at em dashes and a long pause at the paragraph containing only "¶".

        - Read "Remedy announces, "Perfectly healed…"" with a calm, clinical warmth — slightly bright on "Perfectly healed".
        - For Remedy's lines, use a matter-of-fact, kindly mechanical tone — friendly but slightly literal.
        - Read the narrator's lines ("I say...", "I promise...") with soft, personal warmth and occasional hesitation on ellipses — show vulnerability.
        - For Buddy's lines, adopt a reassuring, supportive tone — gentle and proud on "I'm proud of you.".
        - When you reach the paragraph containing only "¶", hold a longer silence (a full beat) before continuing.
        - Emphasize "That's it — everything I own in this world." with a wistful, small-lost quality.
        - Close the final line "But *I'm not staying.*" with quiet determination — slightly firmer and resolute.

        Buddy advises, "Get some sleep. Dawn comes early, and Leafwhisper mentioned the first day involves significant terrain variation requiring energy reserves."

        I smile despite myself — chatty plant guide for three days, I can handle that — I've handled everything else.

        ¶

        Dawn arrives in shades of blue-violet light.

        I stand outside the facility, morning air cool against my skin. Scout bounces nearby, energized and ready. Buddy hums softly from my pocket.

        Leafwhisper and Rootwalker wait at the forest edge.

        Rootwalker asks, "Ready?"

        I look back once. Holloway's fruiting bodies have emerged to see us off, waving gently in the breeze. Somewhere inside, Remedy is probably already working on someone else's chemistry. The facility has been my home for a week — but Elder Heartwood waits ahead.

        And I'm done waiting.

        I say, "Ready."

        We walk into the forest.

        The journey has begun.

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Warm, intimate narrator voice with steady pacing; allow brief reflective pauses at em dashes and a longer silence at the paragraph containing only "¶".

        - Read "Buddy advises, \"Get some sleep...\"" with a calm, reassuring tone — gentle and matter-of-fact.
        - On the line "I smile despite myself — chatty plant guide for three days..." use a small wry smile in the voice; treat the em dashes as reflective beats.
        - When you reach the paragraph containing only "¶", hold a longer silence (a full beat) before continuing.
        - Read "Rootwalker asks, \"Ready?\"" plainly and understated — no flourish; the stage direction replaces the adverb "simply."
        - Read the short scene-detail lines ("Scout bounces nearby...", "Buddy hums softly...") with light color: Scout lively, Buddy contentedly quiet.
        - Emphasize "But Elder Heartwood waits ahead." with a slight lift in gravity — signal anticipation.
        - Put dialog lines on their own line with a short pause before and after so they stand out from narration.
        - Closing cadence: Soft landing; warm fall, lingering last syllable, cozy pause.

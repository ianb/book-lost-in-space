    Reviewing the passage for voiceover: 
    1. Staccato sentences: Several short, choppy sentences (e.g., "Not purple—", "Holy shit.") should be merged to flow naturally for a narrator. 
    2. Dialog speaker clarity: Buddy's lines come as internal bursts; dialog should be on separate lines with a clear lead-in so the listener knows who is speaking. 
    3. Ambiguous pronouns: Mostly clear, but keeping speaker tags for Buddy avoids confusion when multiple voices are present. 
    4. Places that require a pause: Before "And that's when the quiet hits me" needs a long, dramatic pause; also use medium pauses to separate thoughts. 
    5. Text too formal/stilted: Some sentences can be slightly smoothed for spoken cadence without changing meaning. 
    6. Symbols/non-text: "800 meters" should be read as "eight hundred meters." 

    Edits will: merge short sentences, join adjacent short paragraphs when they continue a thought, put dialog on its own lines with lead-ins, use em dashes and ellipses for pauses, mark a long pause with a paragraph containing only "¶", convert numeric measurement to words, and apply *bold* and _italics_ for emphasis where helpful. No content meaning will be altered.

        The first thing I notice is the light — not purple. I expected purple, saw it through the hull breach — but it's the quality of it, like stepping into perpetual twilight even though it's midday. Sunlight filters through the canopy overhead, turning lavender and soft, dreamlike. Everything glows.

        The second thing is the ground — soft. My boots sink slightly into a groundcover that feels like moss but isn't: purple-black and springy, almost pleasant underfoot. I take another step, then another — equipment bag heavy on my shoulder. The forest stretches ahead of me: tree trunks the width of ancient oaks but smooth and burgundy-dark. When I look up, the leaves are nearly black from below, but when the light catches them just right they glow deep violet.

        *Holy shit* — I'm on an alien planet.

        Buddy's voice bursts into my head —
        "Isn't this exciting, Kira! Let's talk about alien photosynthesis! You see, on Earth, plants use chlorophyll which absorbs red and blue light, but here the dominant photosynthetic pigment appears to—"

        I laugh despite everything — the pain in my leg, the dead pilots, the fact that I might die out here. Buddy wants to teach me about photosynthesis.

        I say —
        "Later, Buddy. Right now I just want to get to the water."

        Buddy replies —
        "Of course! Safety first! The stream is approximately eight hundred meters southwest. I'll guide you!"

        Southwest — right. I adjust my grip on the bag and start walking.

        ¶

        And that's when the quiet hits me.

        No birdsong. No insects buzzing. No rustle of small animals in the undergrowth. Just wind moving through the canopy — a soft, almost musical sound, deeper than Earth leaves, like the forest itself is breathing. My own footfalls become the loudest thing, muffled by the springy groundcover but still present. Still _very, very_ alone.

        I ask —
        "Buddy, you said no animal life detected, right?"

        Buddy —
        "Correct! The ecosystem appears entirely plant-based! Fascinating, really — on Earth, animals fill numerous ecological niches, but here it seems the plant life has adapted to—"

        I cut him off —
        "So it's just… quiet. No animals means no animal sounds."

        "Exactly! Though plant-based ecosystems can create their own acoustic environments through—"

        I tune him out, focusing on the silence. It's beautiful in a way — peaceful, but also wrong. Earth forests are never this quiet. There's always something: birds, insects, wind rattling dry leaves, water somewhere. Here there's just that soft breathing of thick leaves and my own footsteps.

        The forest floor is oddly clear, too. No undergrowth tangling my feet, no fallen branches to navigate around. Just the purple-black groundcover and those massive trees, spaced far enough apart that walking between them is easy. Almost like someone maintains it.

        That thought makes me uneasy, but I push it down.

        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Observant and slightly breathless at first, then amused, shifting to wary and quiet; hold a long, heavy pause when the silence becomes apparent.

        - Read the opening lines with calm curiosity; use a measured, descriptive pace for the scene-setting and color detail. 
        - For "*Holy shit* — I'm on an alien planet." make "*Holy shit*" louder and sharper, then drop to stunned wonder for "I'm on an alien planet." 
        - Lead into each dialog with the narration cue then place the quoted line on its own line. For Buddy's lines: bright, fast, enthusiastic — slightly chipper and scientific. 
        - Use the paragraph containing only "¶" as a long, silent beat before "And that's when the quiet hits me." Pause about 1.2–1.5 seconds there. 
        - Emphasize the em dash pauses as medium breaks (~300–400 ms); render ellipses (…) as a trailing, hesitant drop (~500–600 ms). 
        - For "Still _very, very_ alone." stretch and soften "very, very" to underline isolation. 
        - End quietly and tensely on the last sentence; let the final line trail a beat before moving on.

        I keep walking. The equipment bag digs into my shoulder. The air is thick—humid in a way that makes my skin feel damp, my hair already curling with moisture. It smells like growing things: sweet and earthy and floral all at once, with an edge of something unfamiliar underneath—not bad—just… other.

        The light shifts as I move deeper into the forest. Filtered through that purple canopy, everything takes on dreamlike lavender tones. Shadows aren't gray—they're purple-black, deep and soft. I pass a tree whose branches twist back toward the trunk in a way that makes my brain itch—wrong: the shapes are tree-like enough to be familiar but alien enough to remind me constantly: you're not home.

        Buddy, delighted —
        "Kira, I'm detecting some interesting atmospheric data! The oxygen-nitrogen ratio is remarkably similar to Earth, but there are trace elements that suggest—"

        I ask —
        "Buddy. Is the air safe to breathe?"

        Buddy, quick and cheerful —
        "Oh! Yes! Completely safe! Though the photosynthetic pigments I mentioned earlier create a unique light spectrum that—"

        I say —
        "Safe. Got it. Thanks."

        Our rhythm is getting better. Extract the useful information, let the rest go. Buddy means well. I'm learning to work with—

        Pain flares up my leg, sudden and sharp enough to stop me mid-step.

        I've been walking on adrenaline, ignoring the bandaged wound, focused on getting to water. But the injury doesn't care about my focus. I lean against the nearest tree trunk—smooth bark, faintly warm even in the shade—and try to breathe through it.

        The bandage is seeping. I can see it darkening through my pants. This is stupid. I'm injured, alone, should be resting not hiking through an alien forest. But water is eight hundred meters and I need it and the shuttle's life support is dying and—

        Buddy —
        "Kira, I'm detecting elevated pain signals! Your injury requires—"

        I say —
        "I'm fine. How much farther?"

        A pause. Then, quieter:
        Buddy —
        "Approximately six hundred meters remaining. Are you sure you can—"

        I say —
        "I'm sure."

        I push off the tree, test weight on my leg. It hurts. It's going to keep hurting. But I can walk.

        So I do.

        The limp is more pronounced now. Beauty doesn't make injury hurt less. Wonder doesn't erase the fact that I could die out here.

        I'm maybe fifty meters farther when I see it.

        Movement—high in the trees to my left, something shifting.

        I stop, heart suddenly pounding. I say —
        "Buddy, did you see that?"

        Buddy —
        "See what, Kira?"

        I point, even though Buddy doesn't have eyes.

        "Something moved. Up there."

        The forest is still again. Nothing but that soft wind-breath through the leaves.

        But I saw it. I'm sure I saw it.

        The quiet feels different now—not peaceful but charged, aware.

        ¶

        I'm not alone.

        Buddy, uncertainty creeping into his usually cheerful tone —
        "I'm not detecting any animal life forms, but in an unknown environment, sensors can miss—"

        There. Again. Higher up, something definitely moving among the branches.

        Plant life has to be—no fauna detected, Buddy said—but plants don't move like that—quick, purposeful, tracking—

      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Start observant and measured, slightly breathless at times; grow more pained and determined during the wound beats; shift to taut alertness and stillness as the movement appears, then hold a long, heavy pause at "¶" before the revelation.

        - Read the opening description with calm curiosity and a measured pace; allow the sensory details to breathe.  
        - For the lead-ins to dialog use a neutral narration tone, then deliver the quoted lines on their own line.  
        - Buddy's lines: bright, chipper, slightly scientific — quick delivery but clear. Use the em dash break before the quote as a short beat.  
        - When pain flares, tighten the breath, shorten phrases, and make the physical effort audible but not theatrical.  
        - For "The quiet feels different now—not peaceful but charged, aware." slow slightly and lower volume, then insert the paragraph "¶" as a long silent beat (about 1.2–1.5 seconds).  
        - After "¶" read "I'm not alone." with controlled certainty — quiet but unmistakable.  
        - Keep all em dash pauses as medium breaks (~300–400 ms) and ellipses (…) as trailing, hesitant drops (~500–600 ms).

        Except this is an alien planet, and the scans detected extensive plant life—what if…?

        Movement again—closer this time, not threatening exactly but deliberate, watching.

        My voice comes out too loud in the quiet, startling even me.
        I say—"Hello?"

        There is nothing, yet I feel it—I feel watched.

        The forest isn't empty—something is out there in the purple twilight, curious, observing.

        All teachable moment forgotten, Buddy says—
        "Kira, I recommend we proceed with caution—unknown environment protocols suggest—"

        I reply—"Yeah—caution. Got it."

        I keep walking, slower now, every sense alert—my hand finds the cutting tool in my bag though I don't know what good it would do.

        The movement follows me—staying in the trees, keeping pace.

        Something is out there—and whatever it is, it's _very_ curious about me.
      </text>
      <stage-directions>
        Overall tone &amp; pacing: Taut, observant, quietly tense; let the lines breathe and keep a careful, listening quality throughout.

        - Read the opening line with thoughtful curiosity and a small trailing hesitation on "what if…?" to suggest worry and possibility.
        - For "I say—\"Hello?\"" use a startled, louder moment then immediately rein it in; the line should sound surprised and tentative.
        - Read the line "There is nothing, yet I feel it—I feel watched." with growing unease on the second clause; emphasize "I feel watched" as a low, tightened statement.
        - For Buddy's block: keep the voice bright, slightly chipper and a bit clinical — quick delivery but clear; pause at the em dash after "Buddy says—" then deliver his quote with a short, interrupted cadence at the trailing em dash.
        - For the reply, "I reply—\"Yeah—caution. Got it.\"" use a resigned, clipped tone—acknowledgement without relief.
        - When narrating the physical actions (walking, hand finding tool), slow marginally and make them grounded and precise; let the listener sense the steady caution.
        - Emphasize the last line's underscored phrase: give a quiet, slightly unsettled emphasis to "_very_ curious about me." Hold a short beat after the final sentence.
        - Closing cadence: Soft landing; uncertain fall, lingering last syllable, short quiet pause.

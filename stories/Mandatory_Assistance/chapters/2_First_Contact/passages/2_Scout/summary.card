  <facts>
    <reasoning>This passage records a significant, lasting encounter: Kira makes direct contact with previously-undetected native life. Facts selected are those that will matter for later scenes (existence, behavior, possible sociality, interaction with injured humans, and that Buddy identified them as plant-based). I did not include transient sensory details (purple light, exact sequence of hops) or Kira's immediate emotional reactions beyond how they establish the biology/behavior of the organisms. No contradictions with prior facts were found — this passage resolves the earlier ambiguous canopy movement as living plant-based organisms rather than conflicting with the earlier sensor results that showed no animal life.</reasoning>
    <established>
      <fact id="CHANGE_FIRST_CONTACT_MADE_WITH_NATIVE_LIFE">Kira Voss has made first contact with local native lifeforms (the spherical plant organisms) during her excursion from the shuttle.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_MOBILE_SPHERICAL_PLANT_ORGANISMS_PRESENT">Mobile, spherical plant-based organisms (about basketball-sized, surface of woven thin branches/leaves) exist in the immediate area.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_LOCOMOTION_BOUNCE_AND_ROLL">These plant organisms locomote by deliberate bouncing and rolling (controlled arcs and pauses), not by simple passive displacement.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_BEHAVIOR_CURIOUS_NONHOSTILE">The plant spheres exhibit curiosity rather than aggression: they approach cautiously, circle to observe, and retreat when Kira flinches.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_TACTILE_INVESTIGATION_TENDRILS">The organisms can extend small tendrils/branch-like structures to reach toward objects (one extended toward Kira's bandage), indicating tactile investigation and possible capacity to interact with injured tissue or objects.</fact>
      <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_SOCIAL_GROUP_BEHAVIOR">The spheres appear socially connected or in groups: movement and sounds in the canopy indicate more individuals responding/approaching after the initial encounter.</fact>

  <timing>
    <reasoning>The previous passage ended with Kira feeling watched in the purple forest; the new passage continues immediately with “Something drops from the canopy ahead of me.” There are no scene-break cues, no mention of sleeping, traveling long distances, or an explicit time skip—everything is a direct, sensory continuation (stop, hand to beacon, stare, small hops, crouch, flinch, tendril reach, retreat, more rustling). The sequence of beats (object drops, inspects, circles, tendril, reflexive recoil, re-crouch, object departs toward approaching group) reads as a short encounter lasting a few moments to a few minutes. The previous-passage timing note places the prior end at ≈01:10 post‑crash; that anchors this passage to start immediately after that. Given the physical actions (breathing hard, flinching, a brief crouch, and the plant’s slow deliberate bounces) the encounter plausibly occupies roughly 1–3 minutes. Buddy’s sensor/scanning lines are consistent with near-instantaneous AI responses. The passage ends as the sphere departs toward other approaching plant-entities and Kira straightens to investigate more; that feels like the natural end of the immediate encounter and occurs within minutes of its start. No implausible tasks or travel happen in the gap, so the timing is consistent with the characters’ needs and limitations (injured leg, short bursts of movement, short diagnostic scans).</reasoning>
    <starts>≈01:10 post‑crash (immediate continuation from previous passage)</starts>
    <ends>≈01:12 post‑crash (approximately 1–3 minutes after the start)</ends>
    <gap-from-previous>none — this is an immediate continuation. The drop and ensuing interaction occur within seconds of the previous passage's final beat. During that gap no substantive activity is required beyond immediate perception and reaction.</gap-from-previous>
    <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence of sensory reactions, short-range movement, brief AI scans, and Kira’s reflexive flinch and recovery fit comfortably into a 1–3 minute window. Buddy’s near-instant sensor feedback is appropriate for an onboard AI. The only minor note is that Kira’s bandage is described as seeping earlier; the quick crouch/re-crouch and continued mobility are believable for short intervals but would become problematic only if the scene were extended much longer without addressing bleeding or rest.</plausibility>
  </timing>
  <characters>
    <reasoning>The narrator is Kira Voss (first-person) and Buddy (the AI companion) speaks and scans—both appear throughout. No other named characters from the provided list are mentioned. The plant-sphere appears but is not one of the available character cards. No new characters enter during the scene and no listed characters leave before the passage ends. The scene takes place on an alien planet/forest, which corresponds to the Sector_7-Gamma-412 Planet entity.</reasoning>

  <story-so-far>
    <reasoning>The new passage describes Kira's first direct encounter with native mobile plant-life: a round, mossy/branch-like “plant sphere” that dropped from the canopy, exhibited deliberate curious behavior, inspected Kira’s injured leg with a tendril, retreated when she flinched, then left toward other approaching movement in the trees. Buddy scanned it as plant-based with an unknown locomotion mechanism and no standard communications detected. I consolidated atmospheric/visual details (lavender twilight, groundcover textures) into a single note about unfamiliar flora and removed extraneous sensory prose. I also noted that Buddy’s earlier report of “no animals” was incomplete given these mobile organisms. Relevant logistics (injuries, supplies, offline systems, powered locked biological container, water location, SAM offline, Buddy active) remain because they affect immediate survival and choices.</reasoning>
    <summary>
      - Kira Voss is the shuttle cargo specialist; ship manifest included three mining containers, two terraforming supplies, and one powered but locked temperature-controlled "Biological Samples" container (Voss noted temperature fluctuations).
      - FTL drop-out and atmospheric entry caused catastrophic failure: navigation/stabilizers malfunctioned, cargo shifted, and the shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed were found dead in the cockpit.
      - Kira was pinned under cargo, sustained head bleeding, bruised ribs, and a wounded right leg; she freed herself, salvaged first-aid supplies, and applied a pressure bandage.
      - Primary ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI with a childlike persona called "Buddy" activated and is assisting Kira with scans and guidance.
      - Hull breach exposed a breathable atmosphere and extensive unfamiliar alien plant life; the shuttle is the only immediate shelter and contains the survivors' bodies.
      - Inventory: three sealed water containers (~72 hours), ~7 days of rations, basic medical supplies, salvageable tools, an emergency tarp, and the powered but locked biological container.
      - Shuttle systems: life support on emergency reserves (~48 hours remaining); communications, propulsion, and the distress beacon are offline/damaged.
      - Initial environmental scans reported an Earth-like O2/N2 atmosphere safe to breathe, unusual photosynthetic pigments, no detected animals, and a freshwater source ~800 meters southwest.
      - Kira decided she may need to survive for months and set out toward the stream despite her injured leg; she packed first-aid, some water, a water-quality scanner, tarp, and a cutting tool.
      - While en route through an alien forest of unfamiliar flora she felt watched as deliberate movement tracked her through the canopy.
      - A round, fuzzy, mobile organism (a "plant sphere") dropped from the canopy and approached; Buddy scanned it as plant-based with an unknown locomotion mechanism and no detectable standard-frequency communications.
      - The plant sphere behaved deliberately and curiously: it circled Kira, inspected her leg and bandage with a tendril, and retreated immediately when she flinched—indicating non-hostile/observational behavior.
      - The sphere then oriented toward the trees and moved away as additional movement in the canopy approached; more similar organisms are coming.
      - Implication: Buddy's earlier "no animals" reading was incomplete—there are mobile, possibly social plant-like lifeforms nearby; Kira has just made first contact and must anticipate further encounters before reaching the water.

  <emotional-journey>
    <reasoning>This passage shifts from immediate alarm to a tender, astonished curiosity and then pivots into renewed suspense. The POV (Kira) moves quickly through fear (instinctive flinch and pain), cautious relief when the plant-sphere proves nonthreatening, and a warm, almost reverent curiosity as ‘first contact’ feels mutual. That intimacy is then undercut at the end by a spike of anticipation/dread as more life approaches. The reader experiences the same rapid emotional changes: initial suspense/anxiety, then uplifted wonder and emotional relief at the nonhostile interaction, and finally renewed tension as the scene promises more encounters. This continues the story’s recurring arc (anticipation → dread → acceptance) but foregrounds wonder and a fragile, empathetic beat that refreshes the pattern rather than repeating it monotonously.</reasoning>
    <beats>
      <beat tags="tension, dread">POV: Immediate alarm — Kira freezes, heart racing, hand on the beacon, and reacts instinctively (flinch/scramble) when the unknown tendril approaches; the pain in her leg amplifies the vulnerability. Cause: unexpected object dropping from the canopy and an unknown entity making contact. Reader: shares sharp suspense and brief visceral fear, keyed by the physical detail of Kira’s pain and reflexive withdrawal.</beat>
      <beat tags="wonder, hope">POV: Rapid transition to curious, awed empathy — Kira recognizes the sphere as living, reads its cautious approach as nonhostile, feels a fragile connection in that silent moment of mutual regard (first contact). The quick retreat by the sphere after Kira flinches produces guilty relief and then cautious optimism. Cause: the plant-ball’s deliberate, gentle movements and apparent interest in Kira’s injury. Reader: experiences uplifted wonder and a warm, tentative relief/hope that the alien life is benign and even sympathetic.</beat>
      <beat tags="anticipation, dread">POV: Renewed alertness and mounting worry — after the brief communion, Kira notices more movement in the canopy and her heart races again for new reasons: unknown numbers and unknown intentions. Cause: the plant-ball orienting toward the trees and the increasing rustle of many things approaching. Reader: shifts from wonder back into suspense and heightened anticipation of what the arriving creatures will mean for Kira’s survival. Pattern note: this fits the story’s repeating beat of expectation → threat, but the interposed wonder beat prevents emotional monotony.</beat>

  <narrative-promises>
    <reasoning>I checked each previously-open promise against what actually happened in the passage and noted new setups the scene introduced. The most direct payoffs are the moving plant life and the thing that was following Kira: both are explicitly shown and therefore close out the corresponding promises. Buddy's earlier claim of "no animal life detected" is effectively upheld because the approaching entities are explicitly plant-based, so that promise is treated as fulfilled rather than contradicted. Many longer-term mysteries (navigation, coordinates, SAM, life-support, water objective, etc.) are untouched by this scene and remain active. The passage introduces several new, concrete narrative setups: a clear first-contact event with a discrete plant-bodied entity, strong evidence the plants are intelligent/communicative, the arrival of more of them (a social group), and the possibility that these plants may interact with Kira's injury (medical/healing potential). The interaction also left an ambiguity about intent (non-hostile curiosity vs. unknown danger), which I mark as tentative. No earlier, relevant promise was explicitly abandoned by the passage, so I mark none as lapsed.</reasoning>
    <fulfilled>
      <promise id="MOBILE_ALIEN_PLANT_LIFE">The earlier hint that plant life on the planet could move is directly demonstrated: the bouncing/rolling plant sphere and its deliberate movements confirm mobile plant organisms.</promise>
      <promise id="ENTITY_FOLLOWING_KIRA">The previously introduced tracking/following presence is resolved: the thing pacing her in the trees is revealed as a plant sphere that followed/observed her and signaled others.</promise>
      <promise id="NO_ANIMAL_LIFE_DETECTED">Buddy's scan reporting no animal life is upheld: the moving entities are explicitly plant-based organic material rather than fauna, resolving the earlier uncertainty about whether the movements were animals.</promise>

      <promise id="PLANT_INTELLIGENCE_AND_COMMUNICATION" tentative="false" introduced="6">The plant sphere's deliberate, investigatory behavior and apparent recognition suggest the flora possess some level of intelligence or communicative behavior to be explored further.</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_MEDICAL_INTERACTION" tentative="true" introduced="6">The sphere extended a tendril toward Kira's wound before she flinched—introducing the possibility the local flora may respond to injuries or have healing/medical properties (not yet confirmed).</promise>
      <promise id="PLANT_SOCIAL_GROUP_APPROACH" tentative="false" introduced="6">The plant sphere signaled/oriented toward the trees and others are heard approaching; this sets up a likely imminent encounter with multiple, socially-coordinated plant entities.</promise>

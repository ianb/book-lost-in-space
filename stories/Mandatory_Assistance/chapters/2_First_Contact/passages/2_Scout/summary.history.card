      <narrative-promises>
        <reasoning>This passage turns the earlier, ambiguous canopy movement into a confirmed encounter: a bouncing, sentient plant-sphere approaches, inspects the narrator's injured leg, withdraws when she flinches, then retreats into the trees as others approach. That pays off the setup that something in the canopy was watching and that flora on this world may be mobile/sentient. Nothing else from the previous list is resolved — most technical and mission-level mysteries (ship systems, navigation, sample container, SAM, etc.) remain untouched — but several threads get new, more specific beats (social plants, possible medicinal/contact behavior, unknown locomotion). I find two previous promises clearly paid off; no major previously-open promise is abandoned/moot by this passage (they remain relevant), while many are carried forward and several new, immediate story promises are introduced.</reasoning>
        <fulfilled>
          <promise id="MOBILE_FLORA_OR_SENTIENT_PLANTS">The moving sphere confirms that plant life on the planet is mobile and displays purposeful, curious behavior rather than random plant motion.</promise>
          <promise id="ENTITY_WATCHING_IN_CANOPY">The repeated canopy movement is resolved into actual creatures: one plant-sphere falls and inspects the narrator, then returns toward approaching others — confirming the narrator was being watched and that contact is imminent.</promise>
        </fulfilled>
        <open>
          <promise id="BIO_SAMPLES_TEMPERATURE_ANOMALY">Locked, temperature-controlled biological samples container remains unexamined and powered/locked — its contents and any risk/value are still unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="NAV_COORDS_MISMATCH">Why the shuttle is at this planet and any navigation/coordinate mismatch remain unexplained.</promise>
          <promise id="SYSTEMS_FAILURE_OR_EXTERNAL_INTERFERENCE">Root cause of the crash/systems failure (mechanical, sabotage, EMP/alien influence, etc.) has not been determined.</promise>
          <promise id="BIOHAZARD_OR_CONTAMINATION_RISK">Potential for biological/chemical contamination from alien plants, water, or breached cargo remains unresolved and is now heightened by direct plant contact near the narrator's wound.</promise>
          <promise id="KEPLER_288_STATION_OR_PLANET_PROMISE">Exact identity of the planet and the broader mission context remain unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="SAM_OFFLINE_OR_DESTROYED">SAM's fate and any lost logs or data remain outstanding.</promise>
          <promise id="ALIEN_ENVIRONMENT_DISCOVERY">Detailed mapping, hazards, edible resources, and long-term habitability remain open; the encounter advances knowledge (mobile flora) but much mapping and testing remain.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_RESOURCE_CHALLENGE">Limited ship supplies vs. long rescue times remains a pressing problem; securing sustainable water/food/shelter is still unresolved and now riskier given local life.</promise>
          <promise id="SEARCH_FOR_LOGS_AND_NAV_DATA">No new cockpit logs or navigation data have been recovered; the promise to search the wreck for logs remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="EMERGENCY_AI_REPLACEMENT_DISCOVERED">Buddy's origin/privileges and the implications of an ad-hoc childlike AI controlling survival-critical info remain to be investigated.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_LIMITATIONS_AND_CAPABILITIES">Buddy provided scans but could not fully characterize locomotion or communicate with the plant; its sensor/classification limits remain to be tested.</promise>
          <promise id="AI_COMPATIBILITY_AND_SECURITY_RISK">Whether Buddy's configuration poses security or authorization risks (or can be escalated) remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="SURVIVAL_WITH_CHILD_AI">How useful Buddy will be over the long term, and whether its pedagogy will help or hinder survival, remains an active thread.</promise>
          <promise id="LONG_TERM_SURVIVAL_REQUIREMENT">Rescue windows still long; narrator must secure long-term solutions — still outstanding.</promise>
          <promise id="BIO_CONTAINER_LOCKED_NEEDS_ACCESS">The biological sample container is still locked and consuming power; gaining access or shutting it down remains an outstanding task.</promise>
          <promise id="REPAIR_OR_ALTERNATE_COMMUNICATIONS">Distress beacon/transmitter are damaged; attempts to repair or improvise communications remain necessary and unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="RESOURCE_RATIONING_AND_FORAGING">Given limited supplies, the narrator must find forage/salvage options and ration; how to do so safely (now with mobile flora present) remains open.</promise>
          <promise id="WATER_QUALITY_TEST_NEEDED">The nearby water must still be tested for potability/toxins/microbes; first contact with local life increases risk to sampling.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_ADAPTABILITY_AND_AUTHORIZATION">Whether Buddy can adapt modes, escalate privileges, or access ship systems remains unresolved.</promise>
          <promise id="BUDDY_SENSOR_BLINDSPOT">Buddy previously missed canopy movement; while Buddy can scan the sphere now, its sensory and classification blind spots require further testing.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMEDIATE_WATER_ACQUISITION_RISK">The narrator still needs water but the approaching local life and worsening leg injury make reaching and testing the water more dangerous.</promise>
          <promise id="LEG_INJURY_RISK_AGGRAVATION">The leg wound is still seeping and painful; the narrator's flinch caused acute pain and the risk of infection or loss of mobility remains high.</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_PERPETUAL_TWILIGHT_LIGHT_ANOMALY">The lavender-filtered light and unusual photosynthetic pigments/light physics remain unexplained.</promise>
          <promise id="MAINTAINED_FOREST_OR_DESIGNED_ENVIRONMENT">The earlier feeling that the forest is 'maintained' remains an open question (the organized behavior of local flora could support or refute it).</promise>
          <promise id="FOREST_ACOUSTIC_ANOMALY">The forest's musical 'breathing' and lack of animal noise remain to be explained.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_CURIOUS_NONHOSTILE_BEHAVIOR">The plant-sphere's curiosity and non-aggressive approach suggests local flora may be inquisitive or social rather than hostile; this invites future interaction possibilities and constraints.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_COMMUNICATION_ATTEMPT">The bouncing/hopping and tendril behavior functioned like signaling; whether this is a communicative system that can be learned remains an open promise.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_COLONY_OR_SOCIAL_STRUCTURE">The sphere's retreat toward approaching rustling indicates a network or group of individuals; the social organization and numbers of these organisms remain unknown.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_MEDICINAL_OR_CONTAMINATION_INTERACTION">The tendril's inspection of the bandage implies plants can detect wounds and might heal or transmit pathogens — the potential for both assistance and contamination must be tested.</promise>
          <promise id="PLANT_LOCOMOTION_MECHANISM_UNKNOWN">How the plant-spheres move (muscular-like branches, pneumatic hops, hydraulic action, coordinated fungal networks, etc.) was not determined and should be investigated.</promise>
          <promise id="IMMINENT_GROUP_CONTACT">More movement in the canopy is approaching; an imminent, larger-scale encounter (benign or hostile) is now likely and requires immediate tactical decisions.</promise>
          <promise id="FIRST_CONTACT_CONSEQUENCES">An explicit first contact just occurred; the story must explore consequences (communication, trust, danger, colony interactions, ecological impacts, and diplomatic/ethical choices).</promise>
          <promise id="ALLIANCE_OR_MISUNDERSTANDING_RISK">The narrator's instinctive flinch already produced recoil from the plant; future interactions could lead to alliance, mutual aid, or harmful misunderstanding depending on behavior and responses.</promise>

      <facts>
        <reasoning>This passage records a significant, lasting encounter: Kira makes direct contact with previously-undetected native life. Facts selected are those that will matter for later scenes (existence, behavior, possible sociality, interaction with injured humans, and that Buddy identified them as plant-based). I did not include transient sensory details (purple light, exact sequence of hops) or Kira's immediate emotional reactions beyond how they establish the biology/behavior of the organisms. No contradictions with prior facts were found — this passage resolves the earlier ambiguous canopy movement as living plant-based organisms rather than conflicting with the earlier sensor results that showed no animal life.</reasoning>
        <established>
          <fact id="CHANGE_FIRST_CONTACT_MADE_WITH_NATIVE_LIFE">Kira Voss has made first contact with local native lifeforms (the spherical plant organisms) during her excursion from the shuttle.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_MOBILE_SPHERICAL_PLANT_ORGANISMS_PRESENT">Mobile, spherical plant-based organisms (about basketball-sized, surface of woven thin branches/leaves) exist in the immediate area.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_LOCOMOTION_BOUNCE_AND_ROLL">These plant organisms locomote by deliberate bouncing and rolling (controlled arcs and pauses), not by simple passive displacement.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_BEHAVIOR_CURIOUS_NONHOSTILE">The plant spheres exhibit curiosity rather than aggression: they approach cautiously, circle to observe, and retreat when Kira flinches.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_TACTILE_INVESTIGATION_TENDRILS">The organisms can extend small tendrils/branch-like structures to reach toward objects (one extended toward Kira's bandage), indicating tactile investigation and possible capacity to interact with injured tissue or objects.</fact>
          <fact id="CHANGE_PLANT_SPHERE_SOCIAL_GROUP_BEHAVIOR">The spheres appear socially connected or in groups: movement and sounds in the canopy indicate more individuals responding/approaching after the initial encounter.</fact>
        </established>
        <conflicts/>
      </facts>
      <timing>
        <reasoning>The previous passage ended with Kira feeling watched in the purple forest; the new passage continues immediately with “Something drops from the canopy ahead of me.” There are no scene-break cues, no mention of sleeping, traveling long distances, or an explicit time skip—everything is a direct, sensory continuation (stop, hand to beacon, stare, small hops, crouch, flinch, tendril reach, retreat, more rustling). The sequence of beats (object drops, inspects, circles, tendril, reflexive recoil, re-crouch, object departs toward approaching group) reads as a short encounter lasting a few moments to a few minutes. The previous-passage timing note places the prior end at ≈01:10 post‑crash; that anchors this passage to start immediately after that. Given the physical actions (breathing hard, flinching, a brief crouch, and the plant’s slow deliberate bounces) the encounter plausibly occupies roughly 1–3 minutes. Buddy’s sensor/scanning lines are consistent with near-instantaneous AI responses. The passage ends as the sphere departs toward other approaching plant-entities and Kira straightens to investigate more; that feels like the natural end of the immediate encounter and occurs within minutes of its start. No implausible tasks or travel happen in the gap, so the timing is consistent with the characters’ needs and limitations (injured leg, short bursts of movement, short diagnostic scans).</reasoning>
        <starts>≈01:10 post‑crash (immediate continuation from previous passage)</starts>
        <ends>≈01:12 post‑crash (approximately 1–3 minutes after the start)</ends>
        <gap-from-previous>none — this is an immediate continuation. The drop and ensuing interaction occur within seconds of the previous passage's final beat. During that gap no substantive activity is required beyond immediate perception and reaction.</gap-from-previous>
        <plausibility>Plausible. The sequence of sensory reactions, short-range movement, brief AI scans, and Kira’s reflexive flinch and recovery fit comfortably into a 1–3 minute window. Buddy’s near-instant sensor feedback is appropriate for an onboard AI. The only minor note is that Kira’s bandage is described as seeping earlier; the quick crouch/re-crouch and continued mobility are believable for short intervals but would become problematic only if the scene were extended much longer without addressing bleeding or rest.</plausibility>
      </timing>
      <characters>
        <reasoning>The narrator is Kira Voss (first-person) and Buddy (the AI companion) speaks and scans—both appear throughout. No other named characters from the provided list are mentioned. The plant-sphere appears but is not one of the available character cards. No new characters enter during the scene and no listed characters leave before the passage ends. The scene takes place on an alien planet/forest, which corresponds to the Sector_7-Gamma-412 Planet entity.</reasoning>

      <story-so-far>
        <reasoning>The new passage describes Kira's first direct encounter with native mobile plant-life: a round, mossy/branch-like “plant sphere” that dropped from the canopy, exhibited deliberate curious behavior, inspected Kira’s injured leg with a tendril, retreated when she flinched, then left toward other approaching movement in the trees. Buddy scanned it as plant-based with an unknown locomotion mechanism and no standard communications detected. I consolidated atmospheric/visual details (lavender twilight, groundcover textures) into a single note about unfamiliar flora and removed extraneous sensory prose. I also noted that Buddy’s earlier report of “no animals” was incomplete given these mobile organisms. Relevant logistics (injuries, supplies, offline systems, powered locked biological container, water location, SAM offline, Buddy active) remain because they affect immediate survival and choices.</reasoning>
        <summary>
          - Kira Voss is the shuttle cargo specialist; ship manifest included three mining containers, two terraforming supplies, and one powered but locked temperature-controlled "Biological Samples" container (Voss noted temperature fluctuations).
          - FTL drop-out and atmospheric entry caused catastrophic failure: navigation/stabilizers malfunctioned, cargo shifted, and the shuttle crashed; Jensen and Reed were found dead in the cockpit.
          - Kira was pinned under cargo, sustained head bleeding, bruised ribs, and a wounded right leg; she freed herself, salvaged first-aid supplies, and applied a pressure bandage.
          - Primary ship AI SAM is offline; emergency neural-link AI with a childlike persona called "Buddy" activated and is assisting Kira with scans and guidance.
          - Hull breach exposed a breathable atmosphere and extensive unfamiliar alien plant life; the shuttle is the only immediate shelter and contains the survivors' bodies.
          - Inventory: three sealed water containers (~72 hours), ~7 days of rations, basic medical supplies, salvageable tools, an emergency tarp, and the powered but locked biological container.
          - Shuttle systems: life support on emergency reserves (~48 hours remaining); communications, propulsion, and the distress beacon are offline/damaged.
          - Initial environmental scans reported an Earth-like O2/N2 atmosphere safe to breathe, unusual photosynthetic pigments, no detected animals, and a freshwater source ~800 meters southwest.
          - Kira decided she may need to survive for months and set out toward the stream despite her injured leg; she packed first-aid, some water, a water-quality scanner, tarp, and a cutting tool.
          - While en route through an alien forest of unfamiliar flora she felt watched as deliberate movement tracked her through the canopy.
          - A round, fuzzy, mobile organism (a "plant sphere") dropped from the canopy and approached; Buddy scanned it as plant-based with an unknown locomotion mechanism and no detectable standard-frequency communications.
          - The plant sphere behaved deliberately and curiously: it circled Kira, inspected her leg and bandage with a tendril, and retreated immediately when she flinched—indicating non-hostile/observational behavior.
          - The sphere then oriented toward the trees and moved away as additional movement in the canopy approached; more similar organisms are coming.
          - Implication: Buddy's earlier "no animals" reading was incomplete—there are mobile, possibly social plant-like lifeforms nearby; Kira has just made first contact and must anticipate further encounters before reaching the water.

      </story-so-far>
      <emotional-journey>
        <reasoning>This passage shifts from immediate alarm to a tender, astonished curiosity and then pivots into renewed suspense. The POV (Kira) moves quickly through fear (instinctive flinch and pain), cautious relief when the plant-sphere proves nonthreatening, and a warm, almost reverent curiosity as ‘first contact’ feels mutual. That intimacy is then undercut at the end by a spike of anticipation/dread as more life approaches. The reader experiences the same rapid emotional changes: initial suspense/anxiety, then uplifted wonder and emotional relief at the nonhostile interaction, and finally renewed tension as the scene promises more encounters. This continues the story’s recurring arc (anticipation → dread → acceptance) but foregrounds wonder and a fragile, empathetic beat that refreshes the pattern rather than repeating it monotonously.</reasoning>
        <beats>
          <beat tags="tension, dread">POV: Immediate alarm — Kira freezes, heart racing, hand on the beacon, and reacts instinctively (flinch/scramble) when the unknown tendril approaches; the pain in her leg amplifies the vulnerability. Cause: unexpected object dropping from the canopy and an unknown entity making contact. Reader: shares sharp suspense and brief visceral fear, keyed by the physical detail of Kira’s pain and reflexive withdrawal.</beat>
          <beat tags="wonder, hope">POV: Rapid transition to curious, awed empathy — Kira recognizes the sphere as living, reads its cautious approach as nonhostile, feels a fragile connection in that silent moment of mutual regard (first contact). The quick retreat by the sphere after Kira flinches produces guilty relief and then cautious optimism. Cause: the plant-ball’s deliberate, gentle movements and apparent interest in Kira’s injury. Reader: experiences uplifted wonder and a warm, tentative relief/hope that the alien life is benign and even sympathetic.</beat>
          <beat tags="anticipation, dread">POV: Renewed alertness and mounting worry — after the brief communion, Kira notices more movement in the canopy and her heart races again for new reasons: unknown numbers and unknown intentions. Cause: the plant-ball orienting toward the trees and the increasing rustle of many things approaching. Reader: shifts from wonder back into suspense and heightened anticipation of what the arriving creatures will mean for Kira’s survival. Pattern note: this fits the story’s repeating beat of expectation → threat, but the interposed wonder beat prevents emotional monotony.</beat>

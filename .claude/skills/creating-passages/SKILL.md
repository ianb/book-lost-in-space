# Creating Passages

Follow CARD_EDIT_LOOP for each card. Order of creation:

1. `ske create /stories/Story_Name/chapters/1_Chapter/passages/1_Scene_Name/`
2. Fill passage-placement.card (maps to chapter scenes)
3. Fill outline.card (goals, beats, act)
4. Fill passage.card (the prose itself)

## Writing passage.card

Before writing prose, check:
- narrative-guide.card for POV, tone, length bounds
- writing-samples.card for voice consistency

## When to Confirm with User

- Passage goals if unclear from outline
- Major character decisions/reveals
- Significant plot developments

## When to Proceed Autonomously

- Prose details (show reasoning)
- Specific word choices
- Scene descriptions

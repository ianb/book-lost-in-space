# Time Management in Stories

This skill covers how to track and maintain consistent timing across passages.

## Key Concepts

**The first passage sets the clock for the entire story.** Even if the exact date doesn't matter to the plot, pick a specific date and time. This allows subsequent passages to track the passage of time accurately.

**It's okay to invent an exact start time.** If the story doesn't specify "it was 7:15 AM," you can still set `time-at-start` to `2024-03-15T07:15`. The prose doesn't need to mention the exact time—the timestamp is for continuity tracking.

## Fields to Edit

### outline.card (per passage)

Located at: `/{passage}/outline.card`

**`<time-at-start>`** - When this passage begins
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` (ISO 8601, 24-hour time)
- Examples: `2024-03-15T07:00`, `1847-06-22T17:30`, `3042-11-08T14:15`
- For the first passage: Pick a specific date and time, even if arbitrary
- For subsequent passages: Should be at or after the previous passage's `time-at-end`

**`<time-at-end>`** - When this passage ends
- Same format as `time-at-start`
- The next passage's `time-at-start` should be at or after this time

## Informational Fields (Do Not Edit)

### summary.card (auto-generated)

Located at: `/{passage}/summary.card`

The `<timing>` section is generated by `ske gen summaries` and provides:
- `<starts>` - Inferred start time (HH:MM or approximate like "~14:00", "morning")
- `<ends>` - Inferred end time
- `<gap-from-previous>` - Time elapsed since the previous passage ended
- `<plausibility>` - Assessment of whether timing makes sense given character actions

**Do not edit summary.card** - it's regenerated automatically. If timing seems wrong, fix the outline.card fields instead.

## Best Practices

1. **Set the first passage's time early.** Don't leave it TBD—pick something reasonable for your setting.

2. **Be consistent with time gaps.** If a character travels somewhere, ensure enough time passes. The summary's `<plausibility>` field will flag issues.

3. **Track days, not just hours.** For multi-day stories, the date portion matters. A passage ending at 23:00 and the next starting at 07:00 should show a date change.

4. **Use approximate times when prose is vague.** If the passage says "that evening," you can estimate `~19:00`. The `~` prefix indicates approximation.

5. **Consider what happens off-screen.** The `gap-from-previous` in summaries helps identify where characters had time to do things between passages.

## Example Timeline

```
Passage 1: 2024-03-15T07:00 → 2024-03-15T09:30  (morning at office)
Passage 2: 2024-03-15T09:45 → 2024-03-15T11:00  (15 min gap - walked to cafe)
Passage 3: 2024-03-15T14:00 → 2024-03-15T16:30  (3 hr gap - lunch happened off-screen)
Passage 4: 2024-03-16T08:00 → 2024-03-16T10:00  (next morning)
```

## Fixing Timing Issues

If `ske gen summaries` flags timing as implausible:

1. Check if there's enough time for travel/actions between passages
2. Adjust `time-at-start` of the later passage if needed
3. Or adjust `time-at-end` of the earlier passage
4. Consider if you need to add a passage to cover the gap

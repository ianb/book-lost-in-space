# Reasoning Fields

This is step 4 of CARD_EDIT_LOOP: "Fill fields (reasoning fields FIRST)"

## Purpose

Reasoning fields guide your thinking. They're meta-commentary for the agent, not story content.

Types: `<reasoning>`, `<reasoning-character>`, `<reasoning-plot-arc>`, `<reasoning-{field}>`

## Workflow

1. Fill reasoning FIRST - work through your thinking
2. Then fill content - based on your reasoning
3. `ske snapshot` clears reasoning automatically after archiving

**Always fill reasoning before content fields.**

# Reasoning Fields

## Purpose

Reasoning fields guide your thinking. They're meta-commentary for the agent, not story content.

Types: `<reasoning>`, `<reasoning-character>`, `<reasoning-plot-arc>`, `<reasoning-{field}>`

## Workflow

1. **Fill reasoning FIRST** - Work through your thinking
2. **Then fill content** - Based on your reasoning
3. **Snapshot clears reasoning** - `ske snapshot` clears reasoning after archiving

## After Snapshot

When `ske snapshot` archives a version:
- Reasoning fields cleared automatically
- Ready for next edit cycle

**Always fill reasoning before content fields.**

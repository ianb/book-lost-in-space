## `<reasoning-exposition-plan>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for planning exposition

Before creating the exposition plan, read the context: Read story-info.card to understand the protagonist, opening-situation, and story premise. Read setting.card for world details. Confirm you've read these by briefly stating what story you're planning exposition for.

Identify what readers must understand: List world-building information readers need to follow the story. Identify character context or backstory essential upfront. Note immediate situation details. Consider: Protagonist identity (name, age-ish, pronouns, role), immediate situation (what they're doing right now), setting stamp (where, when, world type), world rules (1-2 operational constraints that might surprise readers), tone and genre signals, key relationships, terminology that needs explanation.

Identify what to withhold: Determine what information can be revealed later to maintain mystery. List questions that should remain unanswered to create intrigue. Flag 1-2 deliberate blanks to withhold for later payoff.

Plan natural delivery: Consider how each piece of exposition can be woven into action, dialogue, or sensory detail rather than info dumps.

## `<must-explain>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** What the opening passage(s) need to explain to the reader

**Format:** Markdown list with bullet points, optionally mark items as (urgent) or (optional) based on when they need revealing

These are pieces of information readers need to understand and follow the story. Some are urgent (must be in the very first passage: protagonist identity, name, rough age, basic situation). Others are optional (should be revealed in first few passages but not immediately urgent: personality traits, economic context, world details). Each item should be specific enough that it can be shown through action, dialogue, or sensory detail—not told through exposition dumps.

**When creating:**
List the essential information without arbitrary minimums—could be just one item for a simple story. Mark urgent items that must appear immediately. Include optional items that should appear in early passages but aren't critical. Consider: protagonist name and age, time period (if matters), immediate location, basic situation. Avoid listing personality details or world-building context unless truly essential for immediate comprehension.

**When editing:**
- Is each item specific (not vague)?
- Have you distinguished urgent from optional reveals?
- Are urgent items truly essential for the first passage?
- Can each be shown through action/dialogue/sensory detail?
- Have you included time period if it matters?

**Good examples:**
- - (urgent) Mira is a young woman, early twenties
- (urgent) She works as a cargo clerk at the harbor
- (urgent) The story takes place in a port city with a Mediterranean feel, roughly 1800s-equivalent technology
- (optional) She has noticed patterns in the shipping records
- - (urgent) Kael is a healer, thirties
- (urgent) She runs a clinic in the lower district
- (urgent) The city is under some form of martial law with patrols
- (urgent) Magic healing exists in this world
- (optional) Kael took an oath to heal all who need it

## `<withhold>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Information to deliberately withhold in the opening

**Format:** Markdown list with bullet points

These are details that should remain mysterious or unexplained initially to create intrigue and forward momentum. This is often based on the story-arc—what future reveals or complications drive the narrative? Withholding the right information maintains narrative tension and gives readers questions to pursue. Focus on less obvious mysteries that create intrigue or future possibility, not just obvious secrets like "who the murderer is" in a mystery. Can be empty for stories without mystery elements.

**When creating:**
List information to keep mysterious without arbitrary minimums—could be empty for non-mystery stories. Consider: less obvious details that create future possibility, complications hinted at but not explained, character motivations left ambiguous, world details that enhance mystery when vague. Be specific about what to avoid revealing. Base this on the story-arc.card to understand what future reveals drive the narrative.

**When editing:**
- Is each item specific (not vague)?
- Will withholding this create intrigue (not confusion)?
- Are these less obvious mysteries (not just "who did it")?
- Do these connect to the story-arc?
- Does the list balance explanation with mystery?

**Good examples:**
- - What past relationship exists between Mira and the harbor master that makes her hesitate to go over her supervisor's head
- Whether the smuggling operation is part of something larger than trade fraud
- Why Mira specifically was assigned to this position at this time
- - What oath Kael actually swore and under what circumstances
- Why the fugitive has a particular scar that Kael seems to recognize
- Whether Kael has harbored fugitives before
- [Empty for a straightforward story with no mystery elements]

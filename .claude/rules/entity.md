## `<entity-type>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Categorizes what kind of entity this is.

A short label identifying the category of entity. This helps writers quickly understand what they're dealing with.

**When creating:**
Use a simple, descriptive label. Common types include: location, city, country, region, organization, faction, religion, artifact, landmark, institution, species, language, tradition, or custom types as needed.

**Good examples:**
- location
- city
- organization
- religion
- artifact
- faction
- landmark

## `<summary>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Brief description for quick reference.

**Format:** 1-2 sentences

A concise summary that captures the entity's essential identity and role in the story world. This is what writers need to understand the entity quickly.

**When creating:**
Write 1-2 sentences that answer: What is this? Why does it matter to the story? Focus on what's distinctive and relevant.

**Good examples:**
- The Grand Bazaar is Constantinople's sprawling covered market, where merchants from across the known world trade everything from silk to secrets.
- The Silk Guild controls textile trade in the city, wielding economic power that rivals the nobility.
- Mount Karthax is an active volcano that the local population believes houses their fire god.

## `<description>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Extended details about the entity for future reference.

**Format:** Bulleted list in Markdown format

A collection of stable facts, details, and context that writers may need when the entity appears in the story. Can be quite long—record anything that should remain consistent. Focus on what's useful for writing, not exhaustive world-building.

**When creating:**
Use bullet points for each distinct fact or detail. Include: history, notable features, relationships to other entities, cultural significance, practical information characters might encounter, rules or customs, physical details, or any other stable reference information.

**When editing:**
Verify it focuses on story-relevant details and is consistent with setting.

**Good examples:**
- - Sprawls across sixty covered streets with vaulted ceilings
- Built three centuries ago after the great fire
- Operates under strict guild regulations: each trade has its designated quarter
- Market wardens enforce prices and quality standards
- Foreigners are tolerated but watched closely
- Closes at sunset, though certain merchants conduct after-hours business
- The spice quarter is nearest the eastern gate; textiles dominate the center

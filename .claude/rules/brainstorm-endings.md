## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Potential story ending with emotional tone

Each idea represents a potential story ending with emotional tone and key consequences specified. Should sketch the outcome without writing full prose.

**When creating:**
Give each idea an evocative name (e.g., "Exiled with Honor"). Write 1-3 sentences describing the emotional tone and key consequences. Keep short—emphasize what the ending feels like and what changes, not detailed events. Tag if it should be rare, common, or a fail state. Status defaults to "available" until used.

**When editing:**
Verify evocative names and concise descriptions with emotional tone.

**Good examples:**

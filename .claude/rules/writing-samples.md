## `<reasoning-writing-samples>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective writing samples

Before creating writing samples, read the context: Read the narrative-guide.card to understand the tone, pacing, narrative-stance, and style guidelines. If any passages exist, read them to find exemplary sections. Confirm you've read these by briefly stating the story's voice and narrative approach.

Identify what needs exemplifying: Determine which aspects of voice need demonstration—dialogue style, action pacing, introspective moments, descriptive passages. Decide whether samples should cover multiple POVs. Note specific techniques from narrative-guide that need concrete examples.

Plan annotations: Consider what analysis will help writers mimic the style. Identify words or patterns to replicate or avoid. Note specific techniques used in each sample.

When revising, verify: Do the samples demonstrate the key aspects of the narrative-guide? Do they show range (dialogue, action, introspection)? Are the annotations helpful and specific?

## `<sample>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** One exemplar prose snippet demonstrating the story's style

**Format:** List of <point> elements, each describing one technique

Each sample should be a short, focused example (2-4 paragraphs, under ~250 words) demonstrating a specific aspect of the story's voice. Create multiple samples to show range: dialogue, action sequences, introspective moments, descriptive passages. Each sample includes context, the prose itself, analysis of techniques, and optional notes.

**When creating:**
Write short samples (2-4 paragraphs) that exemplify specific aspects of voice. Choose situations that demonstrate key techniques from narrative-guide. Keep each under 250 words. Provide context, the prose, and analysis of what makes it work.

**When editing:**
Verify sample is short, focused, and demonstrates specific voice aspects.

**Good examples:**
- The ledger lay open on Sarah's desk, columns of figures marching down the page in neat rows. She'd found the discrepancy three days ago—a small thing, really, just a few pounds missing from the household accounts. But it had nagged at her, and now she'd traced it back through six months of entries.

"You're still working on those books?" Her sister paused in the doorway, already dressed for the evening. "Leave it for Mr. Hartford. It's his job to worry about such things."

Sarah closed the ledger. The missing amounts always appeared in the same week of the month. "I suppose you're right."

But she wasn't right, and they both knew it.

## `<voice-sample>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** A short passage (50-100 words) for testing and comparing TTS voices.

**Format:** Prose suitable for reading aloud

For voice testing with `ske compare-voice`. Should cover the range of speech the narrator will perform: narration, dialogue (if used), and quoting other characters' words. Keep it short but varied.

**When creating:**
Include multiple speech types in a compact sample:
- Narrative description
- Dialogue or quoted speech from other characters
- Varied sentence rhythms

**Good examples:**
- The rain started after midnight. She watched it through the window. "You should sleep," he said from somewhere behind her, but she didn't turn. There was something about the sound—steady, unhurried—that made her want to stay exactly where she was.

## `<voice-stage-directions>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Stage directions for how the voice sample should be read.

**Format:** Brief description of affect, pacing, and any specific directions

Stage directions tell the TTS system how to read the voice sample. These work together with the voice-style from story-info.card but can add specific guidance for this particular passage.

**When creating:**
Keep it brief but specific. Include:
- Overall affect (contemplative, warm, tense, etc.)
- Pacing notes (where to slow down, where to pause)
- Any specific line readings if needed

**Good examples:**
- Quiet, contemplative. Slow pacing throughout. Pause before "Tomorrow would bring decisions" - let the weight land.
- Warm but slightly melancholy. Natural conversational pace for dialogue, slower for description.

## `<reasoning-setting>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective settings

Before creating the setting, gather any context: If writing historical or culturally specific fiction, do web searches to understand the time period, social structures, and cultural norms. If adapting existing fictional worlds, review source material. Confirm you've done this research by briefly noting what you've learned.

Identify what makes this setting compelling: What is remarkable about this time and place, and why is the story happening now (not earlier or later)? Whose power structures matter, and how are they enforced? Which tensions will drive stories in this setting? What changes are occurring, or what pressures are building? What is most vivid, vital, or surprising to the reader about this setting?

When revising, verify: Does the setting create natural story pressure? Are the power structures clear and specific? Do the tensions align with the story opportunities you identified?

## `<why-this-setting>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Explain what makes this setting compelling for storytelling

Articulates why this particular time and place creates natural story opportunities. Should identify tensions, conflicts, or contradictions inherent in the setting that generate narrative pressure.

**When creating:**
This should come from the user rather than the AI filling it in autonomously (though you may infer the motivation from what the user says). Write 2-4 sentences highlighting specific tensions, novelty, conflicts, or contradictions. Focus on what makes this setting create natural story pressure—not just "it's interesting" but what conflicts emerge from this time and place.

**When editing:**
Verify it identifies specific tensions and story opportunities grounded in this time/place.

**Good examples:**
- 1920s Paris is a collision of old and new: traditional institutions losing ground to avant-garde movements, rigid class structures cracking under post-war upheaval, and artistic experimentation challenging every convention. This creates natural conflict for characters caught between worlds.
- Star Trek's Federation in the 24th century presents a post-scarcity utopia that's constantly tested. The Prime Directive creates ethical dilemmas where the "right" choice isn't clear. Contact with alien cultures forces characters to question human assumptions about morality, governance, and what it means to be civilized.

## `<what-where-when>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Concrete description of the setting's time, place, and circumstance

Establishes the essential details that anchor the story in a specific time, location, and situation. Goes beyond a simple byline to capture what's happening, not just where and when.

**When creating:**
Write 2-3 sentences. Be specific about date and location—not "the past" but "1924" or "24th century." Include the circumstance that makes this setting interesting: what's happening that creates story potential. Focus on vital context, not exhaustive detail.

**When editing:**
Verify time, location, and circumstance are specific and concrete.

**Good examples:**
- 1920s Paris during the height of the art scene, where avant-garde movements clash with traditional institutions
- Federation space in the 24th century (Star Trek: TNG era), where humanity has achieved post-scarcity but faces complex ethical challenges through contact with alien civilizations

## `<reasoning-social-order>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for understanding the social order

Before creating the social order description, consider the power dynamics: Who holds power and how do they maintain it? Who is marginalized or oppressed, and how/why? What are the gender roles and expectations—how rigid or fluid are they? If race or nationality is relevant to the setting, how does it shape social hierarchy and access to power? What religious or ideological forces shape society?

Identify differences from modern norms: AI tends to default to modern social assumptions. How does this setting's social order differ from contemporary norms? What power structures exist that modern readers might not expect? What behaviors are normalized that would be shocking today, or vice versa?

When revising, verify: Have you explicitly contrasted with modern norms (not just described the setting)? Are gender roles addressed? Are the mechanisms of power specific and actionable?

## `<social-order>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Power structures, hierarchies, and enforcement mechanisms

Describes who holds authority, how they maintain it, who is marginalized, and what social norms govern behavior. AI defaults to modern egalitarian assumptions, so this field must explicitly articulate differences from contemporary norms.

**When creating:**
AI can fill this in based on what-where-when, but should do web searches for historical accuracy if needed. State who holds authority and how they maintain it (laws, customs, violence, religion, economics). Identify who is marginalized and why. Address gender roles explicitly—what's expected, what's forbidden, what's changing. If race or nationality matters, describe how it shapes hierarchy. Compare to modern norms to highlight differences.

**When editing:**
Contrast with modern norms; specify power mechanisms and gender roles.

**Good examples:**
- 1920s Paris maintains rigid class divisions: aristocrats hold social power, bourgeoisie hold economic power, working class provide labor. Women recently gained some independence but face social censure for "unfeminine" behavior like smoking or bobbed hair. Language is deeply coded—using "tu" vs "vous" wrongly can end a career. Unlike today's ostensible equality, class and gender hierarchies are explicit and legally enforced.
- The Federation claims radical equality, but Starfleet officers hold disproportionate influence in decision-making. Species differences matter: Vulcans are respected for logic, Klingons for warrior prowess, Ferengi dismissed as greedy. Gender equality is official policy, though captains are predominantly human and male. The Prime Directive forbids interference with "less advanced" civilizations, codifying a hierarchy the Federation claims not to believe in. Unlike modern diversity rhetoric, the Federation actually practices integration—but their ideals are constantly tested.

## `<reasoning-time-place-primer>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for determining what readers need to know

Before creating the primer, assess reader knowledge: What might a modern reader already know about this time and place? What cultural or historical context would they likely be missing? What details are essential to understanding the story versus merely interesting? What misconceptions might readers have that need correcting? Should you do web searches to ensure accuracy and completeness?

Consider exposition strategy: Note that exposition-plan.card will expand on how to reveal this information in the story—this primer just identifies what needs revealing, not how.

When revising, verify: Is each fact something a reader genuinely wouldn't know (not obvious)? Does it focus on what matters for the story (not just trivia)? Are there gaps where reader assumptions might be wrong?

## `<time-place-primer>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Essential facts readers need to understand the story and setting

**Format:** Bulleted list of facts

Lists concrete information that modern readers might not know or might assume incorrectly. Length varies based on setting familiarity: contemporary settings need fewer facts (2-3), historical or less familiar settings need more (4-6), wholly invented settings need substantial detail (6-10). Focus on social norms, technology limits, or immediate situational awareness—not exhaustive world-building.

**When creating:**
AI can fill this in based on what-where-when. Do web searches for historical or cultural accuracy when needed. Focus on facts that affect how characters can act and interact: technology limits, social constraints, physical realities, cultural assumptions. Note that exposition-plan.card will address how and when to reveal this information in the narrative—this is just the list of what needs revealing.

**When editing:**
Focus on non-obvious facts that help writers write accurate scenes.

**Good examples:**
- - Paris in 1924 has electricity but not universally; many still use gas lamps
- The franc is unstable after WWI; inflation is a daily concern
- Automobiles exist but most people walk or use the Metro
- - The Federation operates on post-scarcity economics; no money, replicators produce most goods
- Warp drive allows faster-than-light travel, but journeys still take days or weeks
- The Prime Directive forbids interference with pre-warp civilizations
- Universal translators handle most language barriers automatically
- Transporters can beam people between ships and planets instantaneously

## `<realism>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Genre and realism constraints for the story world

Defines what can and cannot exist in this world. Establishes genre boundaries and rules.

**When creating:**
AI can guess this from what-where-when, but should confirm with user if uncertain. State the genre clearly. Mention excluded elements or technologies explicitly. If magic or advanced technology exists, state the rules or limits. Be specific about boundaries.

**When editing:**
Ensure genre and boundaries are explicit so writers know what's allowed.

**Good examples:**
- Historical fiction; no anachronistic technology or language
- Hard sci-fi; no FTL beyond proposed Alcubierre envelope
- Magical realism; supernatural elements are subtle and symbolic
- Fantasy; magic follows established rules, no modern technology

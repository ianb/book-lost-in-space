## `<reasoning-emotional-palette>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for identifying the emotional vocabulary of this story.

Before listing emotions, read narrative-guide.card—what genre/tone are we working in? Read story-arc.card—what happens and what's at stake?

**Engage with the story type.** Different genres have signature emotional territories:
- **Thriller/suspense**: Dread, urgency, paranoia, relief, the need-to-know. Cliffhangers and ticking clocks.
- **Mystery**: Curiosity, suspicion, the click of understanding, unease at secrets. The satisfaction of pieces fitting.
- **Romance**: Longing, empathetic arousal, hope, vulnerability, the ache of near-misses. Yearning for connection.
- **Horror**: Creeping dread, the uncanny, violation of safety, revulsion, cathartic fear. Undermining assumptions.
- **Literary fiction**: Resonance, recognition, melancholy, quiet devastation, the weight of small moments. Feeling seen.
- **Comedy**: Anticipation, surprise, delight, relief, the joy of the absurd. Earned laughs and knowing smiles.
- **Tragedy**: Pity, fear, inevitability, catharsis, the beauty of loss. Watching someone fall.

Consider which emotions this specific story should evoke. Not every thriller needs paranoia; not every romance needs ache. What's the specific emotional fingerprint of THIS story?

## `<emotional-palette>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** The specific emotions this story aims to create in the reader.

List the key emotions you want readers to experience. This isn't the arc (which is about progression)—it's the vocabulary of feelings this story works with.

**When creating:**
List 4-8 specific emotions this story should evoke, with brief notes on how/when:
- Name specific emotions (not just "tension" but "dread that something is being hidden")
- Note what creates each emotion (plot elements, character situations, information asymmetry)
- Consider which emotions are primary vs. secondary

Think about the genre but be specific to THIS story. A cozy mystery and a noir mystery have different emotional palettes even within the same genre.

**When editing:**
- Are these emotions specific enough to guide writing?
- Do they match what the story actually delivers?
- Is the palette coherent (emotions that work together)?

**Good examples:**
- - **Comfort/warmth**: The appeal of ritual, of a place that feels like home. Created through sensory detail and routine.
- **Protective affection**: Caring about Maya and what she's built. Created through her attention to customers.
- **Dread**: The sense that something precious is threatened. Created through Frank's arrival, the news.
- **Quiet devastation**: Loss that doesn't rage but aches. Created through Maya's understated reaction.
- **Bittersweet hope**: Something persists even in ending. Created through the final image of making coffee.
- - **Curiosity**: The pull of a puzzle. Created through clues that don't quite fit.
- **Suspicion**: Something's not right about trusted characters. Created through small inconsistencies.
- **Dread**: The sense that the truth is worse than expected. Created through escalating stakes.
- **Shock**: The revelation that recontextualizes everything. Created through the twist.
- **Grim satisfaction**: Justice served, but at cost. Created through the resolution.
- - **Longing**: The ache of wanting someone you can't have. Created through proximity without intimacy.
- **Empathetic arousal**: Feeling the chemistry the characters feel. Created through charged moments.
- **Anxiety**: Will they or won't they? Created through obstacles and misunderstandings.
- **Joy**: The release when they finally connect. Created through the payoff scene.
- **Wistfulness**: This moment won't last forever. Created through the ending's bittersweetness.

## `<reasoning-emotional-arc>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for designing the reader's emotional journey.

Now that you've identified the emotional palette, consider how these emotions sequence. Read story-arc.card—what plot events occur and how does the character change? Consider: What should the reader feel at each major plot beat? How do we want them transformed by the end?

Remember: This is about the READER's emotions, not the characters'. A character might feel triumph while we want the reader to feel dread (dramatic irony). A character might suffer while we want the reader to feel hope.

Work with or against genre expectations intentionally. Subversion only works if you first understand what's being subverted.

Brainstorm different emotional trajectories using the palette you've defined. Then evaluate which best serves the story's themes and impact. State your choice explicitly.

## `<emotional-arc>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** High-level description of the reader's emotional journey through the story.

Describe the overall emotional trajectory in 2-4 sentences. This is the macro view—how should reading this story transform the reader's emotional state from beginning to end?

**When creating:**
Write a concise description of the emotional journey:
- Where does the reader start emotionally? (curiosity, comfort, unease, etc.)
- What emotional shifts occur? (engagement → tension → dread, etc.)
- Where do we want the reader to end? (catharsis, hope, devastation, satisfaction, etc.)

Use arrows (→) to show progression. Be specific about emotions, not just "good" or "bad."

**When editing:**
- Does this arc match what the plot events would actually evoke?
- Is it distinct from the character's emotional arc?
- Does it serve the story's themes?

**Good examples:**
- Comfort → engagement → dread → devastation → quiet hope. The reader should fall in love with this small world, feel the threat to it viscerally, experience the loss, but end with a fragile sense that something meaningful persists.
- Curiosity → unease → mounting dread → horror → exhausted relief. The reader should feel like they're solving a puzzle that becomes increasingly disturbing, building to revelation that recontextualizes everything, ending wrung-out but satisfied.
- Warmth → amusement → tension → cathartic release → gentle melancholy. A romantic comedy arc where the reader enjoys the characters, worries about the obstacle, celebrates the resolution, but feels the bittersweetness of any ending.

## `<reasoning-emotional-beats>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for mapping specific emotional beats.

Look at each major plot beat from story-arc.card. For each one, ask: What should the reader feel at this moment? Why?

Consider:
- Information asymmetry: Does the reader know more or less than the characters?
- Anticipation: Are we building toward something the reader can sense coming?
- Surprise vs. inevitability: Should this moment shock or feel earned?
- Emotional contrast: Does this beat play against what came before?

**Apply genre-specific techniques to specific beats:**
- Where are the natural cliffhanger moments? (end of chapters, scene breaks)
- Where should tension peak vs. release? (readers need valleys to appreciate peaks)
- Where can we create longing, dread, or anticipation by withholding?
- Where do we deliver on promises the genre makes? (the kiss, the reveal, the confrontation)
- Where might we subvert expectations for effect?

## `<emotional-beats>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Specific emotional targets for each major story beat.

Map the reader's intended emotional state at each significant story moment. These beats help identify where act breaks should occur (emotional shifts) and where pacing needs attention.

**When creating:**
For each major plot beat from story-arc, specify:
- The plot beat (brief reference)
- Target reader emotion at this moment
- Why this emotion (what creates it, what it serves)

Format as a list. Be specific—"tension" is less useful than "dread that something is being hidden."

**When editing:**
- Does each beat have a distinct emotional target?
- Do emotions build and contrast appropriately?
- Are there emotional "valleys" where needed (relief before tension)?
- Does this match how passages are actually landing?

**Good examples:**
- - **Opening routine**: Comfort, warmth—reader should feel the appeal of this small world
- **First customer interaction**: Engagement, affection—we're investing in Maya and what she offers
- **Landlord appears**: Unease—something's wrong, we sense it before we know
- **The news delivered**: Gut-punch dread—this world we just fell for is threatened
- **Maya's reaction**: Devastation, but also admiration—she doesn't rage, she makes coffee
- **Final image**: Quiet hope mixed with grief—something precious persists even in ending
- - **Discovery of the first clue**: Curiosity—puzzle pieces, reader leans in
- **Pattern emerges**: Unease—this is bigger than expected
- **First warning**: Fear for the protagonist—stakes become personal
- **Betrayal revealed**: Shock, then dawning horror—recontextualizing earlier events
- **Confrontation**: Tension, hope—can she pull this off?
- **Resolution**: Exhausted satisfaction—earned ending, but at cost

## `<target-ending-feeling>` (required) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** What emotional state should the reader be left in after finishing?

The ending feeling lingers longest. Be specific about what you want the reader to carry away. This guides how to pace the final beats and what note to end on.

**When creating:**
Describe in 1-2 sentences:
- The primary emotion the reader should feel when they finish
- Any secondary or contrasting emotions (hope tinged with grief, satisfaction shadowed by unease)
- What the reader should be thinking about after they close the book/story

**Good examples:**
- Bittersweet hope. The reader should feel the loss of Groundwork but also that Maya's choice to keep making coffee—to persist in human connection despite efficiency—means something. They should leave thinking about what they value that can't be optimized.
- Earned catharsis with lingering unease. The mystery is solved, justice served, but the reader should feel the cost and wonder about the smaller injustices that never get exposed.
- Joyful satisfaction with a touch of wistfulness. The romance resolved, the couple together, but the reader feels the passage of time—this moment won't last forever, which makes it precious.

## `<sources>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** References to files used when planning the reader journey.

**Format:** List of <ref> elements pointing to source files

Typically includes story-arc.card and possibly character files that inform emotional impact.

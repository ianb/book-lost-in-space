## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Hidden information or revelation for narrative twists

Each idea represents hidden information that could be revealed or discovered during the story. Should suggest payoff potential without fully specifying when or how it's revealed.

**When creating:**
Give each idea a meaningful name for quick reference. Write 1-3 sentences describing the hidden information and its potential impact. Use double parentheses ((...)) for spoiler details if needed. Ensure each secret has clear payoff potential. Avoid contradictions with setting.card and existing canon. Status defaults to "available" until the secret is revealed in a passage.

**When editing:**
Verify meaningful names, clear hidden information, and payoff potential.

**Good examples:**

## `<reasoning-meta>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective project metadata

Before creating project metadata, gather context: If a story already exists, read story-info.card to understand the narrative approach. Consider what narrative structure best serves the story concept. Confirm your understanding by briefly stating the story type and structure needs.

Identify key structural decisions: What is the official title? What narrative structure fits this story (linear, cyoa, multi-perspective, etc.)? Will chapters help organize the content, or would passage-only structure work better? Who are the primary creators? What works inspire this story's tone, style, or approach?

When revising, verify: Does the narrative-structure match the story's needs? Is the title consistent across all references? Are inspirations specific and actionable?

## `<id>` (required)

**Purpose:** Unique identifier for the project (UUID)

A UUID that permanently identifies this project. Generated automatically when the project is initialized with `ske init`. This ID is used internally to track the project across uploads and databases.

**When creating:**
Do not create or modify this field. It is automatically generated by `ske init` and should remain unchanged for the lifetime of the project.

**When editing:**
Do not edit this field. The only exception is if a user explicitly wants to fork/copy a project—in that case, the user (not AI) should generate a new UUID to create a distinct project identity.

**Good examples:**
- 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- my-project-id *(not a valid UUID)*
- 12345 *(not a valid UUID)*

## `<slug>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** URL-friendly identifier for the project

A short, URL-safe string used in web addresses and file paths to identify the project. Must be unique across all projects. Unlike the id, the slug can be changed if needed (though this may break existing links).

**When creating:**
Choose a concise, memorable slug using lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Typically derived from the project title but shorter. Examples: "harbor-chronicles", "midnight-city", "adventure-time". Avoid special characters, spaces, or uppercase letters. Must be set before uploading with `ske upload` or generating previews with `ske validate`.

**When editing:**
Can be changed if needed, but be aware this may break existing URLs or references. Choose carefully the first time to avoid needing changes later.

**Good examples:**
- harbor-chronicles
- midnight-city-stories
- the-great-adventure

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- harbor chronicles *(contains spaces)*
- Harbor-Chronicles *(contains uppercase)*
- TBD *(not set)*

## `<title>` (required) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Official title of the project or story

The canonical title used consistently across all documents and references. Should match any marketing copy or public-facing materials.

**When creating:**
Use the official project or story title. Keep it identical across all documents that reference this project. If the title changes, update it here and propagate to all references. For multi-story projects, this is the project title (individual stories have their own titles in story-info.card).

**When editing:**
Verify it's official, current, and consistent across all references.

**Good examples:**
- The Harbor Chronicles
- Midnight City Stories

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- Harbor Chronicles (sometimes) vs The Harbor Chronicles (other times) *(inconsistent)*

## `<subtitle>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Optional tagline or secondary title

Supplementary title or tagline used for clarity, context, or translation. Not always needed.

**When creating:**
Add a subtitle only when it provides necessary context or clarity. Common uses: series differentiation ("Book One: The Discovery"), genre signals ("A Detective Story"), or translation aids. Most projects don't need subtitles.

**When editing:**
Consider if it's necessary; remove if it doesn't add clarity.

**Good examples:**
- Book One: The Discovery
- A Mystery in Five Acts

## `<author>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Creator and contributor credits

**Format:** Repeated <author> elements with role attributes

Lists people who created or contributed to the project. Each person gets their own author element with a role attribute.

**When creating:**
Add one `` element per person. Use role attributes: creator (original author), writer (prose contributor), designer (structural design), editor (content editing). Order by primary responsibility—creator first, then other contributors. Can be empty if authorship tracking isn't needed.

**When editing:**
Verify all contributors are listed with accurate roles, primary contributors first.

**Good examples:**
- 

## `<narrative-structure>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** The story's structural approach—determines how passages connect

Defines how the story is organized and how readers experience it. This is a critical decision that affects all subsequent content creation. Must be one of the defined structure types.

**When creating:**
Choose exactly one narrative structure type. Options:

- **linear**: Standard single-threaded story with sequential passages
- **multi-perspective**: Multiple separate stories from different character perspectives (often first-person with multiple POV characters)
- **cyoa**: Choose your own adventure with branching paths (typically second-person with single POV character)
- **ghost**: Single story where reader controls which perspective to follow (typically third-person with no fixed POV)
- **flashback**: Story told through linked flashbacks (typically first-person with single POV character)
- **cyoa-constraints**: Linear story with one mid-story choice point that sets constraints for the remainder

This choice affects template generation, passage organization, and narrative-stance recommendations.

**When editing:**
Verify it's a valid structure type matching the story's organization. If changing, update all dependent cards.

**Good examples:**
- linear
- cyoa
- multi-perspective

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- branching-narrative *(invalid type)*
- linear and cyoa *(multiple values)*

## `<use-chapters>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Whether the story uses chapter organization

Determines the organizational hierarchy: with chapters (project→stories→chapters→passages) or without (project→stories→passages). This affects how content is structured and referenced.

**When creating:**
Set to true if the story will be organized into chapters, false if passages connect directly without chapter grouping. Consider: Will chapter breaks provide useful organization? Is the story long enough to benefit from chapters? Do natural chapter divisions exist in the narrative? Most short stories or tightly-focused narratives use false; longer works with clear act breaks use true.

**When editing:**
Must be true or false. If changing, update all passage paths.

**Good examples:**
- true
- false

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- yes *(invalid)*
- TBD *(not decided)*

## `<visibility>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Controls who can access the project and its stories

Determines the access level for the entire project. Stories can have their own visibility that overrides this, but cannot be more permissive than the project level.

Choose the appropriate visibility level:
- **private**: Only administrators can see (default for new projects, use during development)
- **beta**: Visible to beta readers who can provide feedback
- **member**: Requires login to access
- **public**: Visible to everyone
- **deprecated**: Hidden, typically replaced by a newer version

Start with "private" and change to more permissive levels as the project matures.

**When editing:**
Only change when ready to expand or restrict access. Consider implications for all stories in the project.

## `<imprints>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Which branded imprints this project belongs to

**Format:** Comma-separated list of imprint slugs

Specifies which imprints (branded domains) this project should be visible on. A project can belong to multiple imprints. Each imprint is a separate branded site sharing the same database.

Can be left empty during early development. `ske upload` will require at least one imprint before uploading.

**When creating:**
List one or more imprint slugs, separated by commas. The default is "lowlight" for the main Lowlight site. Can be left empty during early development.

Available imprints:
- **lowlight**: The main Lowlight Stories site (lowlight.world)

Projects must be assigned to at least one imprint before uploading with `ske upload`.

**When editing:**
Change when moving a project between imprints or making it available on multiple sites. Removing an imprint will make the project invisible on that site.

**Good examples:**
- lowlight

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- mysite *(invalid imprint)*

## `<audiences>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Target audiences for this project's content

**Format:** One audience slug per line, with optional glob patterns

Specifies which audiences this project's content should be generated for. Audiences are defined in the shared `audiences/` directory at the repository root. The `main` audience (English source) is always included implicitly.

This is primarily used during translation generation (`ske gen translations`) and uploads to determine which audience versions to create.

**When creating:**
List audience slugs, one per line. The `main` audience is included automatically so you don't need to list it. Common patterns:

- **Single audience**: Just `main` (default) means no translations
- **Add Spanish**: `es` on its own line
- **Glob patterns**: `es-*` matches `es`, `es-simple`, etc.
- **Exclusions**: `-es-simple` excludes even if matched earlier

Patterns are processed in order—later lines can override earlier matches.

**When editing:**
Update when adding or removing translation targets. Individual stories can override this in their story-info.card if needed.

**Good examples:**
- main
- main
es
- main
es-*
-es-simple

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- spanish *(invalid slug)*

## `<default-model>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Default AI model for ske gen commands

Specifies the default AI model to use for generation commands when no --model argument is provided. This overrides the built-in default (gpt-5-mini) for the project.

**When creating:**
This field is optional and not included by default. Add it only if you want to use a different AI model for generation tasks in this project. Valid values are model aliases (like "claude" for Claude Sonnet) or full model names. See `ske gen translations --help` for available options.

**When editing:**
Change when you want to use a different AI provider or model for this project's generation tasks. Individual commands can still override this with --model.

**Good examples:**
- claude
- gpt-5-mini
- claude-sonnet-4-5

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- chatgpt *(not a valid model)*

## `<inspiration>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Works that inspire aspects of this story

**Format:** List of works with specific aspects noted

Lists specific works (books, films, TV shows, real events) that inspire particular elements of the story. Each entry should identify what aspect is inspiring—not just that the work is influential, but what to learn from it.

**When creating:**
List works that guide specific aspects of your story. For each, name the work and creator, then specify what aspect inspires you: humor style, character dynamics, pacing, tone, narrative structure, etc. Be specific—"for its humor style" is better than "because it's good." This helps writers understand what to emulate and what to ignore from each inspiration.

**When editing:**
Verify each entry specifies what aspect to emulate and is relevant to this story.

**Good examples:**
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams: for its humor style (even though this story is not sci-fi)
The Office (US TV series) by Greg Daniels: for its character dynamics and character development
- Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen: for its dialogue style and social tension
The Wire (HBO series) by David Simon: for its multi-perspective narrative structure

**Bad examples (avoid):**
- The Lord of the Rings: because it's great *(not specific)*

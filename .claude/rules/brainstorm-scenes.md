## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Scene seed exploring conflict or tension

Each idea represents a potential scene that could fit into the story. Should include enough detail to understand what conflict or tension the scene explores without fully specifying execution.

**When creating:**
Give each idea a unique name attribute (e.g., "Night Audit"). Write 1-3 sentences describing what the scene is about, what conflict or tension it might explore, and potential outcomes. Keep varied to cover the emotional spectrum (action, reflection, moral dilemma, intimacy). Status defaults to "available" until the idea is used in an outline.

**When editing:**
Verify unique names with clear conflict/tension described concisely.

**Good examples:**

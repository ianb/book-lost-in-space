## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Plot arc structure with beat notes

Each idea represents a potential plot arc structure with 2-3 beat notes. Should provide enough shape to understand the arc's dramatic progression without fully specifying scenes.

**When creating:**
Give each idea a descriptive name (e.g., "Redemption through betrayal"). Write 2-3 beat notes describing the arc's structure. Mention when to deploy (early branch, climax, etc.) and what thematic function the arc serves. Keep beats minimal—focus on structural shape rather than detailed events. Status defaults to "available" until used.

**When editing:**
Verify descriptive names, minimal beat notes, and deployment timing.

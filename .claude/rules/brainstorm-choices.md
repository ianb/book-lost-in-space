## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Decision point or branching choice for the narrative

Each idea represents a decision point or framing device for player choice. Should describe the pressure and trade-off without spelling out full narrative consequences.

**When creating:**
Give each idea a unique, evocative name (e.g., "Ledger or Witness"). Describe the pressure rather than full narrative—focus on the dilemma, not outcomes. Keep it terse (1-2 sentences). Align with themes from setting.card and character motives. Status defaults to "available" until used in a passage.

**When editing:**
Verify unique names, terse descriptions focused on pressure/dilemma.

**Good examples:**

## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Candidate location for staging scenes

Each idea represents a potential location where scenes could be staged. Should be evocative enough to suggest narrative possibilities without fully specifying layout or function.

**When creating:**
Give each idea a unique, memorable name (e.g., "Harbor Dye-Yard"). Write 1-3 sentences describing what makes the location interesting or different, what narrative purpose it might serve, and atmospheric qualities. Keep descriptions short but evocative. Status defaults to "available" until used to create a full location card.

**When editing:**
Verify memorable names and concise descriptions suggesting narrative possibilities.

**Good examples:**

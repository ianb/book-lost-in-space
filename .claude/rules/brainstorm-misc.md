## `<idea>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Miscellaneous story idea or detail

Each idea represents a specific, meaningful story element that doesn't fit into standard categories (locations, scenes, choices, etc.). Should be concrete enough to use but flexible enough to adapt.

**When creating:**
Give each idea a unique, descriptive name. Write 1-3 sentences describing what makes the idea meaningful to the story and how it could enhance the narrative. Keep descriptions concise but specific. These ideas can optionally be used—they're enhancements, not requirements. Status defaults to "available" until incorporated.

**When editing:**
Verify unique names and specific, meaningful content.

**Good examples:**

## `<reasoning>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective passage outlines

Before creating a passage outline, read the context: Read this chapter's chapter-placement.card to understand the scene outline and identify which scene this passage belongs to. If this isn't the first passage, read the previous passage's outline.card and passage.card to understand where it left off and what narrative handoff propels forward. Confirm you've read these by briefly stating which scene this passage covers and what came before.

Identify the passage's beats and approach: List the beats that deliver the scene's objective. Note where you'll foreshadow or pay off canon elements. Determine how the passage leads into the next moment or choice. Identify which sensory details or motifs should appear. Clarify what information stays hidden versus exposed.

When revising, verify: Confirm the beat sequence accomplishes the passage objective. Check that key moments are present and properly ordered. Ensure the passage flows smoothly from the previous passage.

## `<include-if>` (required)

**Purpose:** What the reader needs to know to make sense of this story

**Format:** Numbered list in Markdown format

These are the facts readers need to understand what they're about to read. This includes who the protagonist is, what they look like, where/when the story takes place (if essential), and any immediate context necessary for comprehension. The reader should come away with a true working image, not a confused or contradictory one. It's okay not to show everything, but what you do show should give the reader solid ground to stand on.

**When creating:**
List 3-5 essential facts. Focus on what's necessary for the reader to make sense of this story: Who is the protagonist? What do they look like? Where are we? When is this (if the date/time period matters)? What's the immediate situation? Each fact must be deliverable through action, dialogue, or sensory detail—not exposition dumps. Keep it lean.

**When editing:**
- Would a reader be confused without these facts?
- Are all items actually in the prose?
- Are they shown through action/dialogue/sensory detail (not exposition)?
- Is this list lean (not overloaded)?

**Good examples:**
- 1. Mira is a young woman working as a cargo clerk
2. She's methodical and notices details others miss
3. The story takes place in a busy harbor city (visible through setting)
4. Discrepancies in shipment records are unusual in this well-ordered system

## `<story-goal>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** What this passage accomplishes within the overall story

This states what the passage delivers in the narrative arc. Should map to the passage-objective from passage-placement.card if it exists, or to the scene objective from chapter-placement.card.

**When creating:**
One sentence stating what this passage accomplishes for the story. Focus on the goal—what it establishes, reveals, or advances—not just what happens. Be specific about the narrative purpose.

**When editing:**
- Does it describe a goal or objective (not just facts)?
- Does it match what's actually in the outline?
- Is it specific (not vague)?
- Does it connect to the scene or passage objective?

**Good examples:**
- Establish Mira's suspicion that her supervisor is complicit in the smuggling operation
- Force Kael to choose between her oath as a healer and her duty to the law, setting up the story's central moral conflict
- Reveal the scope of the conspiracy extends beyond what the protagonist initially believed

## `<introduces>` (optional) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Characters, concepts, or ideas being introduced to the reader for the first time

List anything the reader encounters for the first time in this passage: a new character, a concept they haven't heard of, a location with significance, a piece of world-building. These need special attention in the prose to land clearly without feeling like exposition.

**When creating:**
Write brief natural language listing what's new. Focus on things that need explanation or establishment—not every detail, just what the reader needs to understand. For characters, note what the reader should learn about them. For concepts, note what needs to be clear.

Examples:
- "Marcus's sister Elena (first appearance—establish her protective nature)"
- "The binding ritual (reader needs to understand it's irreversible)"
- "The harbor's black market (exists, dangerous, Mira knows to avoid it)"

**When editing:**
- Is everything listed actually new to the reader at this point?
- Does each item note what the reader needs to understand?
- Is it brief and scannable?

**Good examples:**
- Marcus's mentor Demetrios (first appearance—stern but fair, has history with Marcus's father). The concept of "sealed contracts" (magically binding, breaking one has serious consequences).
- The night market district (dangerous reputation, where illegal goods flow, Marcus has avoided it until now).
- Elena's daughter Sophie (age 7, Marcus's niece, he's protective of her).

## `<pov-inner-life>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** The POV character's inner emotional state throughout this passage

Describe what the POV character is feeling, fearing, hoping, or processing internally during this passage—even if these emotions won't be stated directly in the prose. This is author-facing context that helps ensure emotional authenticity. In limited POV, the prose may only hint at these feelings; in omniscient or introspective styles, they may be more explicit. Either way, knowing the inner life guides word choice, pacing, and subtext.

**When creating:**
Describe the POV character's emotional journey through the passage. What are they feeling at the start? How does that shift? What fears or hopes are driving their reactions? What are they processing beneath the surface? Be specific about emotional states, not just "nervous" but why and about what.

**When editing:**
- Does it capture the emotional arc, not just a single state?
- Is it specific enough to guide prose tone and word choice?
- Does it connect to the character's deeper motivations?
- Would this help a writer convey authentic emotional subtext?

**Good examples:**
- Maya starts the passage in numb autopilot—going through motions without feeling them. When Chen breaks down, Maya's protective instincts kick in, pushing her own grief aside. But in being present for Chen, she experiences unexpected clarity: grief transforms into something quieter, almost like acceptance. By the end she feels lighter, not because the situation changed but because she finally understands what matters.
- Kael enters the scene confident she's doing the right thing, but each piece of evidence erodes that certainty. By the confrontation she's masking growing dread with professional composure. Underneath: the terrifying realization that being right might cost her everything she's built.

## `<outline>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Beat-by-beat breakdown of passage events

This is the detailed sequence of moments that make up the passage. The outline may be almost as long as the written passage itself—typically 10-50 items. Each beat should be actionable and concrete enough to guide prose writing.

Use double parentheses ((like this)) for author knowledge that shouldn't be stated directly in prose. This includes: secrets the reader shouldn't know yet, facts the POV character doesn't know, plot information being withheld for dramatic effect, and background context that informs how you write but isn't revealed. These annotations create dramatic irony and guide subtext—the reader sees behavior without knowing the cause.

Mark introductions with [Introduces: ...] as a standalone beat where something new enters the story. This flags that the reader doesn't know this yet—their name, who they are, what they look like, what a concept means. The prose will need to actually provide this information. Include what the reader needs to learn:
- [Introduces: Elena — Marcus's sister. Reader needs: her name, that she's his sister, her appearance, her protective nature.]
- [Introduces: sealed contracts — Reader needs: what they are, that they're magically binding, that breaking one has serious consequences.]
- [Introduces: the night market — Reader needs: what kind of place it is, its dangerous reputation, that Marcus has avoided it.]

Track character inner states throughout the outline using prefixed annotations:
- ((POV: ...)) for the point-of-view character's inner experience
- ((Character Name: ...)) for other characters' inner experience

Don't just label emotions—capture the texture of inner experience. But let it be messy, the way actual thoughts are. Half-formed impressions. Sensations without names. Thoughts that trail off or contradict themselves. The thing you notice before you know why you're noticing it.

Include these at key moments: when something shifts internally, when characters mask their true state, when inner experience drives external action. Even if these won't appear directly in prose (especially in limited POV), knowing them guides word choice, body language, and subtext.

**When creating:**
List the sequence of events, character interactions, and key moments using numbered lists. You can use nested numbered lists for sub-beats. Keep beats specific: "Mira cross-references ledger entries" not "Mira works." Include sensory details, character reactions, and transition moments. Aim for 10-50 beats depending on passage complexity.

At key beats, annotate character inner states—not emotion labels, but the fragmentary, unpolished texture of actual experience. Impressions before they become conclusions. The body knowing before the mind catches up. Thoughts that don't quite finish.

Add [Introduces: ...] beats where new elements enter. Place them just before the beat where the introduction happens.

**When editing:**
- Are beats concrete and actionable?
- Do they flow in logical sequence?
- Are background/hidden elements marked with (( ))?
- Do inner state annotations capture texture, not just labels?
- Are key characters' inner experiences tracked through the scene?
- Are [Introduces: ...] markers present for new characters/concepts/locations?
- Do the beats accomplish the story-goal?
- Is the outline detailed enough (10-50 items)?

**Good examples:**
- [Example snippet from a longer outline:]
1. Mira enters her supervisor's office with the ledger under her arm ((POV: okay. Okay. Just the facts.))
2. She lays out three months of wine shipment discrepancies on his desk
3. He glances at the numbers but doesn't really look—dismisses it as clerical error ((he's been taking bribes from the Vendetti family since spring)) ((Supervisor: oh no. Don't look at it. If you look at it—just don't.))
4. Mira notices he's sweating despite the cool morning ((POV: it's not even warm. Three months and he won't even... why won't he look at it?))
5. She presses him: "But sir, three months? That's not clerical."
6. He stands abruptly, tells her he'll look into it ((he'll burn the backup ledgers tonight)) ((Supervisor: she's young. She'll drop it. Just smile.))
7. She leaves, closes door quietly behind her ((POV: the hallway is too quiet. Tomorrow the inspector. She could just... but then what.))
8. [Introduces: Clerk Demos — Reader needs: his name, that he's a junior clerk, his nervous disposition.]
9. She passes Demos in the hallway; he nods but doesn't meet her eyes ((Demos also knows about the bribes—he's been covering the paperwork))
[... outline continues with remaining beats ...]

## `<time-at-start>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Absolute timestamp when this passage begins

**Format:** YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (ISO 8601 format, 24-hour time)

CRITICAL FOR FIRST PASSAGE: The first passage sets the clock for the entire story. Even if the exact date doesn't matter to the plot, pick a specific date and time so subsequent passages can track the passage of time accurately. For stories not set in our timeline, invent a plausible year.

For subsequent passages, this should be consistent with the previous passage's time-at-end (or shortly after if there's a time gap).

**Good examples:**
- 2024-03-15T07:00
- 1847-06-22T17:30
- 3042-11-08T14:15

## `<time-at-end>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Absolute timestamp when this passage ends

**Format:** YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (ISO 8601 format, 24-hour time)

Records when the passage ends. The next passage's time-at-start should be at or after this time. Useful for tracking duration and time gaps between passages.

**Good examples:**
- 2024-03-15T10:15
- 1847-06-22T19:00

## `<plot-arc-act>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Where this passage sits in the story's arc and act structure

This places the passage within the larger narrative structure. Should reference the acts from story-acts.card and the arc from story-arc.card.

**When creating:**
State which act this passage belongs to and what role it plays in the story arc. Reference by name or number from story-acts.card. Explain how it advances plot, character, or theme.

**When editing:**
- Does it accurately reference the act structure?
- Does it explain the passage's narrative role?
- Does it connect to the plot-arc from story-arc.card?

**Good examples:**
- Act 1 (Discovery) - Mira encounters the first evidence of smuggling, establishing the central mystery that drives the investigation arc
- Act 2 (Investigation) - Mira realizes the corruption reaches higher than expected, escalating stakes and isolating her

## `<concludes-arc>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Whether this passage concludes the story arc

Set to true only if this passage ends the entire story arc. Most passages should be false.

## `<concludes-chapter>` (optional) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Whether this passage concludes the chapter (only for stories with chapters)

Set to true if this passage ends the chapter, false otherwise. Only the last numbered passage in a chapter should have this set to true.

## `<sources>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** References to outline files used when creating this passage outline

**Format:** List of <ref> elements pointing to source files

List any outline files you consulted. Typically includes chapter-placement.card for scene context, may also include story-acts.card or story-arc.card.

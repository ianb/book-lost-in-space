## `<reasoning-chapter>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective chapters.

Before creating a chapter card, READ and reference these essential context files:
- **story-arc.card**: Read the plot-arc to understand where this chapter fits in the overall story arc
- **story-acts.card**: Read the acts to understand which act(s) this chapter covers
- **This chapter's chapter-placement.card**: What objective, key beats, and scenes does it define?
- If not the first chapter: previous chapter's chapter.card—where did it leave off? What narrative handoff propels forward?

Confirm you've read these by briefly stating what you learned from each in your reasoning.

Identify the chapter's essence: What is this chapter's core dramatic purpose—what single thing must it accomplish? Which specific tension, theme, or character moment defines this chapter's identity? What is the narrative handoff to the next chapter—what question or situation keeps the reader moving?

When revising, verify: Does the summary accurately capture what's in the passages? Is the focus sharp and specific? Does the chapter feel unified around its purpose?

## `<summary>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Short explanation of chapter arc.

This is a quick reference for what happens in this chapter. Should capture both the narrative movement and the stakes.

**When creating:**
Write 1-2 sentences mentioning what happens and what's at stake. Include the transition or change by chapter's end.

**When editing:**
- Does it accurately reflect what's in the passages?
- Does it mention stakes (not just events)?
- Is it concise (1-2 sentences)?

**Good examples:**
- Mira confronts her supervisor about the ledger discrepancies and realizes he's complicit. She leaves the office determined to investigate further, now aware she can't trust the authorities.
- Kael hides the wounded fugitive while authorities search the town. By chapter's end, she's committed to helping him escape, crossing a line she can't uncross.

## `<focus>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Highlight theme, key tension, or character spotlight.

This names the central element that makes this a unified chapter rather than just sequential passages. A good focus creates coherence: all passages should illuminate this theme, tension, or character moment from different angles. This is what readers remember about the chapter.

**When creating:**
One sentence describing the central theme, tension, or character moment. Be specific: "investigating the ledger" is too vague, but "Mira's realization that her supervisor is complicit" is focused. A chapter should explore one core thing deeply.

**When editing:**
- Does it name something specific that gives the chapter identity?
- Do all passages connect to this focus?
- Could someone remember the chapter by this focus?

**Good examples:**
- Mira's dawning realization that her supervisor is complicit in the smuggling
- Negotiating safe passage while hiding the fugitive's identity
- The moment Kael decides to help him escape, crossing the line into complicity
- Mira gathers proof while avoiding detection by the smugglers
- The cost of choosing family safety over exposing corruption
- Trust breaking: when the authorities prove they can't be relied on
- The healer's neutrality tested by an impossible patient

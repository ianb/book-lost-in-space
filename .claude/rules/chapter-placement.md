## `<reasoning-chapter-placement>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective chapter placement.

Before creating chapter placement, READ and reference these essential context files:
- **story-arc.card**: Read the plot-arc to understand the overall story structure and character development arcs
- **story-acts.card**: Read the acts breakdown to know which act(s) this chapter should cover and their key turning points
- If not the first chapter: previous chapter's chapter-placement.card—where did it leave off? What narrative handoff did it create?

Confirm you've read these by briefly summarizing what you learned from each in your reasoning.

Identify the chapter's role: Which specific story acts does this chapter cover? What essential turning points or revelations must occur? What character development unfolds here? Which dramatic moments must be shown in scenes (not summarized)? Where can time compress without losing clarity?

When revising, verify: Does the scene breakdown match the acts-covered? Are all key beats represented in scenes? Is the pacing balanced? Does it align with story-arc.card's plot-arc?

## `<chapter-objective>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Primary objective for this chapter within the story.

This is the chapter's reason for existing—what it must accomplish in the overall narrative arc. Should align with the acts it covers.

**When creating:**
One sentence stating what this chapter accomplishes. Be specific: not "Mira investigates" but "Mira discovers her supervisor is complicit and decides to investigate alone."

**When editing:**
- Does it match what actually happens in the chapter's scenes?
- Is it specific (not vague)?
- Does it connect to the story acts?

**Good examples:**
- Mira discovers her supervisor is complicit in the smuggling operation and realizes she must investigate alone.
- Kael decides to help the fugitive escape, crossing from neutral healer to active collaborator.

## `<acts-covered>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Which story acts this chapter covers.

References specific acts from story-acts.card. A chapter might cover one full act, part of an act, or span multiple acts.

**When creating:**
List the acts by name or number. Be explicit: "Act 1 (Discovery)" or "Second half of Act 2 (Investigation)".

**When editing:**
- Does the scene-outline actually cover these acts?
- Is the coverage clear (not ambiguous)?

**Good examples:**
- Act 1 (Discovery)
- Act 2 (Investigation) - first half only
- Act 2 (Investigation) and beginning of Act 3 (Confrontation)

## `<key-beats>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Key story beats or moments in this chapter.

These are the essential plot points, revelations, or turning points. These must appear in the scene-outline.

**When creating:**
List 2-5 key beats as bullet points. Each should be a specific event or realization, not vague.

**When editing:**
- Are all these beats actually in the scene-outline?
- Are they specific events (not themes)?
- Are they the most important moments (not everything)?

**Good examples:**
- - Mira confronts supervisor about discrepancies
- Supervisor dismisses her concerns too quickly, revealing complicity
- Mira realizes she can't trust the authorities
- She decides to investigate alone

## `<character-development>` (required) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Character development that occurs in this chapter.

How characters grow, change, or are revealed. Should connect to the character-development from story-arc.card.

**When creating:**
Describe the character shift that happens in this chapter. What do they believe at the start vs. the end?

**When editing:**
- Does this match the character arc from story-arc.card?
- Is the development shown in scenes (not just stated)?
- Is it a meaningful shift (not trivial)?

**Good examples:**
- Mira shifts from trusting the system to realizing corruption reaches the top. She goes from dutiful clerk to lone investigator.
- Kael moves from seeing healing as neutral to recognizing it as inherently political. She accepts she must choose a side.

## `<reasoning-scene-outline>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for breaking the chapter into effective scenes.

When creating the scene outline, brainstorm options to achieve effective pacing and complete coverage of key beats:
- Does it cover all key-beats without feeling rushed or padded?
- Does the scene count fit passage-length constraints?
- Do the scene breaks create natural momentum?

List three different scene breakdowns, varying: number of scenes (3 vs. 5 vs. 7), compression choices (what to show vs. summarize), entry and exit points for each scene. Then evaluate each breakdown against the criteria. Choose the strongest breakdown, stating your choice explicitly and explaining why it serves the chapter better than alternatives.

When revising, check: Does each scene have clear purpose? Are scene breaks at natural shift points (time/place/focus changes)? Do scenes work together to create the chapter's focus? Is total length appropriate?

## `<scene-outline>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Defines the scene outline for this chapter.

Breaks the chapter into individual scenes. Each scene is a unit with single time/place/purpose. When location, time, or focus shifts significantly, start a new scene. Scenes are the building blocks of the chapter.

**When creating:**
For each scene, provide:

**SCENE [number]: [Brief scene title]**
- **Purpose**: Why this scene exists (advance plot/reveal character/establish mood)
- **Events**: What happens (2-3 sentences)
- **Emotional beat**: What feeling or realization lands?
- **Estimated length**: [X-Y words]

**Scene titles should not spoil outcomes.** Use setting/situation titles like "Morning at the harbor office" not outcome titles like "Mira discovers the conspiracy." Scene titles may become passage titles that readers see.

Typical chapter has 3-6 scenes. Each scene should have clear purpose and progression.

**When editing:**
- Does each scene have a clear purpose?
- Do scenes cover all key-beats?
- Are scene breaks at natural shift points?
- Is the total length appropriate for the chapter?

**Good examples:**
- **SCENE 1: Morning at the harbor office**
- **Purpose**: Establish Mira's careful nature and the routine she's disrupting
- **Events**: Mira processes cargo manifests at her desk. She notices a discrepancy in the wine shipments and double-checks her numbers. She brings it to her supervisor.
- **Emotional beat**: Growing unease as she realizes something is wrong
- **Estimated length**: 400-600 words

**SCENE 2: Supervisor's dismissal**
- **Purpose**: Reveal complicity through suspicious reaction
- **Events**: Supervisor waves it off as clerical error, too quickly, too casually. Mira notices he doesn't even look at the numbers. She leaves his office more suspicious than before.
- **Emotional beat**: The moment trust breaks
- **Estimated length**: 300-400 words

**SCENE 3: Mira decides to investigate**
- **Purpose**: Character decision that launches the investigation
- **Events**: Alone at her desk, Mira pulls previous months' ledgers. She finds more discrepancies, all dismissed by her supervisor. She realizes she's alone in this.
- **Emotional beat**: Determination replacing doubt
- **Estimated length**: 300-500 words

## `<sources>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** References to outline files used when writing this chapter placement.

**Format:** List of <ref> elements pointing to source files

List any outline files you consulted. Typically includes story-acts.card, may also include story-arc.card.

## `<reasoning>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Guided thinking for creating effective sleep character configuration.

Before creating a sleep character card, gather source material from across the character's content:

1. Read the character's main card at /world/characters/{characterName}.card:
   - What is their worldview and internal-monologue-style?
   - What brings them comfort? What puts them at ease?
   - What sensory details do they naturally notice?

2. If this character is a POV character in any stories, read those stories:
   - What peaceful moments occur? (These become vignettes to draw from)
   - What settings feel safe or comfortable for this character?
   - What routines or activities calm them?
   - What sensory details appear in descriptions around them?
   - Read story-info.card for voice and voice-style - these are your starting point

3. Consider their life and personality:
   - Where would they naturally go to be alone and at peace?
   - What activities do they find meditative or calming?
   - What would break their calm? (These become avoidances)

This card is building a library of source material - settings, vignettes, sensory details, preferences - that individual sleep passages will draw from.

Confirm you've reviewed the character by noting their internal-monologue-style and at least one story they appear in.

## `<title>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Display title for this sleep content series, used when uploading and displaying on the web.

**Format:** Short title phrase, like a sleep podcast name

The title should capture the character and give a sense of the content's calming nature. Think of it like a sleep podcast title - it should sound inviting and peaceful, while making clear who's narrating.

**When creating:**
Include the character's name and something evocative about the content. Can reference their setting, their voice quality, or the general vibe. Keep it short - 2-5 words typically works best.

**Good examples:**
- Quiet Hours with Elena
- Marcus at the Harbor
- Night Thoughts with Jin
- Elena's Sleepy Evenings

## `<ambient-affinities>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Settings and scenarios where this character naturally finds calm - source material for sleep passages.

**Format:** Bulleted list of settings/scenarios

These are the environments and situations where the character feels at peace. Draw from their stories: where do they go when they're not in the middle of plot? What settings appear as safe or comfortable? What activities do they do during quiet moments?

**When creating:**
List 4-8 settings or scenarios. Pull from:
- Locations that appear in their stories as peaceful or safe
- Activities they do during quiet moments in stories
- Places that fit their personality and backstory
- Both physical environments (a room, outdoor setting) and activities (cooking, walking, watching weather)

These are the settings that individual sleep passages will be built around.

**When editing:**
- Are these drawn from or consistent with their stories?
- Do they provide enough variety for many different pieces?
- Are they specific enough to build a passage around?

**Good examples:**
- - Late evening in the clinic, cleaning instruments by candlelight (appears in "The Fever Season" chapter 3)
- Walking the coastal path at dawn, before anyone else is awake
- Tending the herb garden, sorting dried leaves
- Sitting by the fire, mending clothes while rain patters outside
- The back room of the clinic, organizing supplies
- - The warehouse after closing, alone with the ledgers and quiet
- The harbor at slack tide, watching boats settle (referenced in "Harbor Fire")
- A familiar tavern corner, nursing a drink and watching the crowd thin
- Walking home through empty streets after a late shift
- Sitting on the loading dock at dawn, before the workers arrive

## `<story-vignettes>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Peaceful moments from this character's stories that can be revisited in sleep content.

**Format:** Bulleted list with story references

Extract specific moments from the character's stories that are calm, peaceful, or contemplative. These are "greatest hits" of quiet moments that sleep passages can reference or expand on. Only include moments without tension or unresolved conflict.

**When creating:**
Review the character's story appearances. List specific scenes or moments that are:
- Peaceful and resolved (no hanging tension)
- Sensory-rich (good material for atmospheric description)
- Authentic to the character's experience

Include a brief note and story reference for each.

**Good examples:**
- - The morning after the clinic reopened, making tea and watching the sunrise ("The Fever Season" epilogue)
- Walking through the market on a slow day, noticing the vendors she's known for years ("Market Day" passage 2)
- Sitting with Elena on the roof, neither of them talking ("Harbor Fire" chapter 4 - before the fire, obviously)
- The first evening in the new room, arranging her few possessions (backstory, not in a specific story)

## `<sensory-preferences>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** What sensory details this character notices - guides what to emphasize in sleep content.

**Format:** Bulleted list of sensory categories with notes

Different characters notice different things based on their work, personality, and stories. A cook notices smells and textures. A sailor notices sounds and movement. Review how sensory details are used in their story passages to identify patterns.

**When creating:**
List 3-5 sensory categories this character is attuned to, with notes on their relationship to each. Draw from how sensory details appear in their story content. Consider: sounds, textures, temperatures, smells, light, movement, tastes.

**Good examples:**
- - Sounds: especially layered background sounds (wind, water, distant voices) - appears frequently in her POV passages
- Textures: fabric quality, plant leaves, weathered wood - she's often touching things
- Smells: herbs, cooking, rain on stone - strongly tied to memory for her
- Temperature: warmth of fire, cool night air, sun on skin - comfort is often about temperature

## `<narration-style>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** How this character's voice adapts for calming, sleep-focused content.

**Format:** 1-2 sentences describing style, plus an example snippet (40-80 words)

This builds on the character's internal-monologue-style but adapts it for relaxation. The voice should still be recognizably theirs, but softer, slower, more meandering. No urgency, no tension, no unresolved questions that keep the listener alert.

**When creating:**
Describe how their voice changes for sleep content. Then provide a concrete example of their calming narration voice. The example is more important than the description - show the rhythm and texture.

**When editing:**
- Does it still sound like this character?
- Is the pacing slow enough for relaxation?
- Does the example demonstrate calming qualities?

**Good examples:**
- Unhurried observations, letting thoughts drift without destination. Sentences trail off into sensory detail rather than conclusions.

Example: The herbs are dry now. Rosemary, mostly - you can tell from how the stems snap clean. There's a rhythm to sorting them. Pick up a bundle. Feel the weight. If it crumbles too easy, it's past its best. These are good though. The smell rises when you handle them. Sharp at first, then settling into something warmer.
- Lists and small observations in fragmentary thoughts. Practical noticing without any pressure to act.

Example: The last ship cleared the breakwater an hour ago. Quiet now. The water goes flat when the wind dies - you can see the lantern reflections stretching all the way across. Somewhere a rope creaks. The tide's turning. You can hear it in how the water moves against the pilings. A sound you stop noticing, mostly.

## `<avoidances>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** What must never appear in this character's sleep content.

**Format:** Bulleted list of prohibited elements

Sleep content must never introduce tension, conflict, unresolved problems, or anything that might activate the listener's alertness. This captures both universal sleep-content prohibitions and character-specific ones based on their stories and backstory.

**When creating:**
List things to avoid. Always include the universal prohibitions. Add character-specific avoidances based on:
- Traumatic events from their stories
- Topics that cause them stress or anxiety
- Unresolved plot threads (can't reference things still in tension)

**When editing:**
- Does it include all universal sleep-content prohibitions?
- Are character-specific triggers identified from their stories?
- Is the list specific enough to catch problems in review?

**Good examples:**
- Universal avoidances:
- Unresolved conflict or tension
- Cliffhangers or "what happens next" energy
- Urgent situations requiring action
- Questions that demand answers
- Time pressure of any kind

Character-specific avoidances:
- References to the war or military (backstory trauma)
- Descriptions of injury or illness, even healed (her work involves this, but not for sleep)
- Family members or home village (unresolved grief)
- The events of "The Fire" (too recent, not resolved)

## `<voice>` (required) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Voice selection for text-to-speech audio generation.

**Format:** One of the supported voice names

If this character is a POV character in a story, start with the voice from that story's story-info.card. Use the same voice for consistency - listeners who know the character from stories should recognize them.

If no story voice exists, choose a voice that matches the character's personality and the calming purpose. See the narration-voice skill for detailed voice descriptions and selection guidance.

Available voices: alloy, ash, ballad, cedar, coral, echo, fable, marin, onyx, nova, sage, shimmer, verse.

## `<voice-style>` (required) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** How the voice should be styled for sleep content narration.

**Format:** Structured description: affect, tone, pacing

If this character is a POV character in a story, start with the voice-style from that story's story-info.card, then adapt it for sleep content:
- Slow down the pacing
- Soften the affect (less intensity, more gentleness)
- Keep the core character qualities that make them recognizable

The goal is the same character, but in their most relaxed, unhurried state.

**When creating:**
Specify affect (3-4 attributes), tone (1-2 attributes), and pacing. Pacing should always be slow or measured for sleep content.

If adapting from a story voice-style, note what you're keeping and what you're softening.

**Good examples:**
- Affect: gentle, unhurried, warm, present. Tone: intimate, peaceful. Pacing: slow and steady, natural pauses between thoughts. (Adapted from "Harbor Fire" voice-style - kept the warmth, removed the tension.)
- Affect: soft, grounded, matter-of-fact, easy. Tone: quiet contentment. Pacing: measured, with room to breathe.

## `<voice-sample>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** A short passage (50-100 words) for testing and comparing TTS voices.

**Format:** Prose suitable for sleep narration

For voice testing with `ske compare-voice`. Should demonstrate the character's calming narration voice with varied rhythms—short observations, longer sensory descriptions, perhaps recalled snippets of speech.

**When creating:**
Include variety in a compact sample:
- Sensory observations (short and long)
- Internal thoughts
- Maybe a recalled voice or remembered words

**Good examples:**
- The herbs are dry now. Rosemary, mostly—you can tell from how the stems snap clean. Pick up a bundle. Feel the weight. The smell rises when you handle them, sharp at first, then warmer. Evening light through the window. The kind of quiet that fills a room when nothing needs doing.

## `<voice-stage-directions>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Stage directions for how the voice sample should be read.

**Format:** Brief description of affect, pacing, and any specific directions

Stage directions tell the TTS system how to read the voice sample. For sleep content, these should emphasize the calming, unhurried quality.

**When creating:**
Keep it brief but specific. Include:
- Overall affect (peaceful, contemplative, dreamy, etc.)
- Pacing notes (typically slow and measured for sleep content)
- Any specific pauses or emphasis

**Good examples:**
- Very slow, peaceful. Long pauses between sentences. Let the sensory details land before moving on.
- Soft and dreamy. Unhurried throughout. Slight trailing quality at the end of thoughts.

## `<reasoning>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** Quick setup for gathering the ingredients.

Read sleep-character.card to pick a setting and understand what to avoid. This outline is just gathering materials - the real work happens in the passage.

Quick decisions:
1. Which ambient-affinity or setting? (Or a variation of one)
2. What sensory details fit this setting?
3. What safe topics can the character's thoughts drift through?

Note which ambient-affinity you're drawing from.

## `<ambient-setting>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** The specific environment and situation for this piece.

**Format:** 2-4 sentences describing the setting

Describe where the character is, what time it is, what they're doing (if anything). Should connect to one of the character's ambient-affinities from sleep-character.card, but made specific for this piece.

**When creating:**
Be specific about place, time, and activity. The setting should feel complete and restful - nothing pending, nothing about to happen. The character is simply present in this moment.

**Good examples:**
- Late evening in the clinic, after the last patient left hours ago. A single candle on the worktable, the fire burned down to embers. Sorting through dried herbs for tomorrow's preparations - not because it's urgent, just because it's satisfying work for tired hands.
- The harbor warehouse at night, ledgers closed and locked away. Sitting in the doorway watching fog roll in off the water. The kind of quiet that only happens when the ships are all berthed and the workers have gone home.

## `<sensory-anchors>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** The primary sensory details that will ground the piece.

**Format:** Bulleted list of 4-6 sensory details

These are the specific sensory experiences the narration will return to. They should be calming, concrete, and repeatable - sounds, textures, smells that the listener can imagine and settle into.

**When creating:**
Choose details that fit the setting and the character's sensory-preferences. Include at least one sound, one texture or physical sensation, and one other sense. These will be revisited throughout the piece.

**Good examples:**
- - The dry rustle of herb bundles
- Warmth from the dying fire on one side, cool night air from the window on the other
- Smell of rosemary rising when handled
- The soft scrape of stems being sorted into jars
- Distant sound of the night watch making rounds

## `<internal-state>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** The character's calm emotional state for this piece.

**Format:** 2-3 sentences

Describe where the character is emotionally - but it must be a settled, peaceful state. Not processing difficulty, not working through problems. Simply present, content, or gently tired.

**When creating:**
Write in third person. Describe a state of calm, contentment, or pleasant tiredness. If the character has burdens, they're set aside for now - not resolved, just not present in this moment.

**Good examples:**
- She's tired in the good way, the kind that comes from useful work. The clinic was busy today but everyone who came left better than they arrived. Nothing pending, nothing to solve. Just this: sorting herbs while the fire dies down.
- His mind is quiet tonight. The numbers balanced, the shipment accounted for. Nothing needs him right now. He can just sit and watch the fog and not think about much of anything.

## `<meander-topics>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Topics the narration can drift through without creating tension.

**Format:** Bulleted list of 4-8 safe topics

These are things the character can think about or describe that won't introduce conflict, urgency, or unresolved questions. Memories should be pleasant or neutral. Observations should be simple. No puzzles, no problems, no "I wonder what will happen."

**When creating:**
List topics that are safe for this character. Include: small observations about the setting, simple memories, descriptions of routine activities, thoughts about seasons or weather, noticing details of objects or surroundings. Every topic should pass the test: "Would thinking about this keep someone awake?"

**When editing:**
- Could any topic accidentally introduce tension?
- Are there enough topics for variety?
- Do they fit this character's voice and interests?

**Good examples:**
- - The different textures of dried vs. fresh herbs
- How the clinic was quieter in winter when she was training
- The routine of checking supplies, counting jars
- Noticing how candlelight changes as it burns lower
- The sounds of the town settling into night
- Simple facts about herb preparation (no problems or decisions)

## `<avoid-in-this-piece>` (required) [high priority]

**Purpose:** Explicit reminders of what NOT to include in this specific piece.

**Format:** Bulleted list

Inherits the universal and character-specific avoidances from sleep-character.card, plus any piece-specific concerns. This is a checklist for the writer and reviewer.

**When creating:**
Copy the avoidances from sleep-character.card, then add any piece-specific concerns. If the setting or meander-topics could accidentally veer into problematic territory, note that explicitly.

**Good examples:**
- From sleep-character.card:
- Unresolved conflict or tension
- Cliffhangers or "what happens next" energy
- Urgent situations requiring action
- References to the war or military
- Descriptions of injury or illness

Piece-specific:
- Don't mention the difficult patient from earlier (resolved, but could reintroduce stress)
- Avoid describing the herb preparation as "needing" to be done - it's optional

## `<pacing-notes>` (optional) [medium priority]

**Purpose:** Guidance for the rhythm and flow of this piece.

**Format:** 2-3 sentences

How should this particular piece feel? Slower or more gently active? More descriptive or more internal? What's the trajectory - does it move toward deeper stillness, or maintain a gentle steadiness throughout?

**When creating:**
Describe the pacing arc. Consider: Does the piece start in motion and settle? Stay steady throughout? Build toward a sense of deep rest?

Sleep content should be long - 1500+ words minimum. The listener is meant to drift off, so there's no rush to conclude. More is often better. 2000-4000+ words is appropriate.

**Good examples:**
- Start with gentle activity (sorting herbs) and gradually slow as the fire dies down. By the end, she's barely moving - just sitting, hands still, watching the last ember. Very slow pace, long and meandering - aim for 2500+ words.
- Steady and still throughout - he's not really doing anything, just watching and noticing. The rhythm comes from returning to the same sensory details with slight variations. Can go very long - 3000+ words, letting each observation unfold fully.

## `<sources>` (optional) [low priority]

**Purpose:** References to source cards.

**Format:** List of ref elements

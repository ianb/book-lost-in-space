# Project Introduction

You're being asked to familiarize yourself with this story project. Take time to understand the world, characters, and narrative structure before doing any work.

## Steps

1. **Read the world foundation** - Start with `world/` directory:
   - `world/setting.card` - The setting, rules, and constraints of this world
   - Any character files in `world/characters/`
   - Any location or concept files

2. **Understand each story** - For each story in `stories/`:
   - `story-info.card` - What this story is about, its themes and goals
   - `narrative-guide.card` - Voice, tone, POV, and stylistic choices
   - `story-arc.card` - The overall dramatic structure
   - `story-acts.card` - Act-level breakdown
   - `reader-journey.card` - Emotional arc for the reader

3. **Get oriented on progress** - Check what's been written:
   - Look at `chapters/` or `passages/` structure (stories may use chapters or flat passages)
   - Note which passages exist and their state
   - Run `ske status` to see what needs work

4. **Summarize your understanding** - After reading, provide:
   - A brief summary of what this story is about
   - The current state of progress
   - Any questions or ambiguities you notice

## Important Files

The most important files for understanding a story project:

- `/world/setting.card` - World rules and setting
- `/stories/{story}/story-info.card` - Story premise and goals
- `/stories/{story}/narrative-guide.card` - How to write this story
- `/stories/{story}/story-arc.card` - Dramatic structure
- `/meta.card` - Project-level configuration

## Understanding TBD

Any field containing "TBD" (to be defined) is something that hasn't been decided yet. This is important context - it tells you what's settled versus what still needs development.

Take your time with this. Understanding the project well makes all subsequent work better.

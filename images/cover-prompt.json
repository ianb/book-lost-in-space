  "prompt": "An alien purple forest - massive burgundy tree trunks with smooth bark, dark violet leaves glowing from within with bioluminescence. Strange flowering plants at ground level, some extending tendrils with small glowing forms like they're offering something. Blue-green bioluminescent pulses moving through the canopy. Two moons visible through the leaves. Lavender-tinted twilight atmosphere, dreamlike but inviting. Small pieces of wreckage barely visible, overtaken by growth. The forest itself is alive and aware.",
  "style": "Soft watercolor with deep purples, violet, and lavender as the dominant palette.\nWarm coral and golden accents for contrast.\nGentle linework with painterly edges.\nBioluminescent glows in blues and greens.\nWarm, inviting lighting despite the twilight tones.",

A vertical view emphasizing the alien tree's scale and distinctive coloring."

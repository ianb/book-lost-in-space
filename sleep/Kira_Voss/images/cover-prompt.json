  "prompt": "Kira resting peacefully against a large tree trunk in the bioluminescent forest at night. Her eyes are closed or half-closed, face completely relaxed, a gentle contentment visible in her expression. The forest around her glows with soft pulses of blue and green bioluminescence - burgundy tree trunks, violet leaves creating a canopy above. Purple twilight sky visible through gaps in the canopy. The light pulses slowly, creating a rhythm of gentle illumination. Everything is still and calm. Kira is wrapped in a warm blanket, settled comfortably, completely at peace. Two moons visible in the lavender sky. The overall mood is deeply restful - the moment just before falling asleep in perfect safety. Kira Voss",
  "style": "Soft watercolor with deep purples, violet, and lavender as the dominant palette.\nWarm coral and golden accents for contrast.\nGentle linework with painterly edges.\nBioluminescent glows in blues and greens.\nWarm, inviting lighting despite the twilight tones.",

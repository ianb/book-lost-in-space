  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Remedy appears as mushrooms of various types, sizes, and colors depending on purpose. Medicinal mushrooms tend to be small, pale, with gilled undersides. Fruiting bodies can emerge within minutes when urgent, or develop more slowly over hours for complex compounds. Each mushroom is temporary, decomposing back after serving its purpose. When using the robot: a salvaged robot patched together from various human technology, about 1.5 meters tall, humanoid shape with articulated arms and basic manipulation capabilities. Remedy's robot control is functional but not particularly graceful—gets the job done.\n\nOutfit and pose: A diverse cluster of medicinal mushrooms emerging from purple forest floor, showing the variety of Remedy's fruiting bodies. Multiple mushroom types visible: small pale mushrooms with delicate gills, larger mushrooms with smooth rounded caps, shelf-like bracket fungi, coral-like branching structures. Sizes ranging from tiny button mushrooms to palm-sized caps. Colors in creamy whites, soft browns, pale yellows, and subtle purples. All emerging from the same white mycelial network visible threading through the purple soil and moss. In the background, a boxy salvaged robot (1.5 meters tall) - industrial utility design with a cubic main chassis, articulated manipulator arms (not humanoid arms), wheeled or tracked base. Patched together from mismatched metal panels. Mycelial growth visible at the robot's base, white threads connecting it to the underground fungal network. This represents one distributed fungal organism appearing through multiple fruiting bodies and controlling the robot. Lavender twilight atmosphere.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Remedy\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

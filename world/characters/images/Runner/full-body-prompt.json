  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Runner appears as thick green vines, 3-5 cm diameter, flexible and strong. The vines emerge from soil, rock cracks, or small openings, growing/extending rapidly to several meters length. Surface has small climbing tendrils and leaves. The vines can wrap, lift, pull, and manipulate objects with considerable strength. How they travel underground and grow/retract so quickly is unclear—the locomotion seems to defy normal plant growth rates. Can use one of the salvaged robots for tasks requiring hands, though she prefers working through her vines since they give her direct tactile feedback on everything she touches.\n\nOutfit and pose: Multiple thick green vines (3-5 cm diameter) emerging from purple forest floor and rock cracks, extending several meters in various directions. 8-10 vine strands visible at different lengths and stages - some fully emerged and active, some just beginning to push through soil. Vines intertwining, coiling around rocks and objects, wrapping and exploring their environment. Small climbing tendrils and leaves sprouting along the vine lengths. Flexible plant texture showing strength and movement capability. Vines spread chaotically across the forest floor - some reaching upward, some sprawled sideways, some wrapped around nearby objects. The underground connection suggested by multiple emergence points. This is a complete vine plant organism with extensive reach. Purple forest floor with moss, rocks, and ferns. Lavender twilight atmosphere.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Runner\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

Small climbing tendrils and leaves sprouting along the vine lengths. Flexible plant texture with subtle green color variations. Vines spread in different directions - some reaching up, some curling sideways, some wrapping around objects - creating a dynamic, organic mass without any organized form. DO NOT create a humanoid shape. DO NOT arrange vines into a head, body, or torso. NO face, NO eyes, NO mouth - this is a chaotic tangle of separate vine strands emerging from soil, not a figure or character. Show the vines as individual plant tendrils in tactile exploration of their environment.

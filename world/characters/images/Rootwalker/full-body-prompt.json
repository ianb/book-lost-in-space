  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Mobile organism composed of thick root structures forming vaguely humanoid shape, approximately six feet tall. Main body consists of intertwined roots creating torso-like mass with rough, bark-textured surface. Arms are clusters of smaller roots bundled together, capable of fine manipulation. Legs are heavy root structures providing stable movement—each step methodical, planting firmly into ground. Soil, small stones, moss, and organic debris integrated throughout composition. No visible face or features, but presence is clearly directed and aware. Moves like concentrated earth given purpose—slow, powerful, grounded. Color ranges from dark brown to rich loam. Overall impression: ancient, solid, reliable.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete mobile root organism, approximately six feet tall, composed entirely of thick intertwined root structures. Dark brown to rich loam-colored roots with rough bark texture, twisted and woven together. Central mass of bundled roots forming the main body. Smaller root clusters branch out like limbs for manipulation and support. Heavy root structures at the base planted firmly into purple forest floor, showing the connection to soil. Soil, small stones, moss, and organic debris integrated throughout the root mass. Ancient wood grain visible in the bark texture. The complete organism from root-base to uppermost root-tips, standing like concentrated earth given purpose and mobility. Purple forest floor with ferns and moss around the base. Lavender twilight atmosphere. Radiates ancient solidity and grounded presence.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Rootwalker\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

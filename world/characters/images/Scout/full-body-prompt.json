  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Spherical plant organism, roughly basketball-sized (about 24 cm in diameter). Outer surface is a tight weave of flexible brownish-green stems/branches forming a ball shape. Small leaves and thin tendrils protrude from the surface, creating a slightly fuzzy appearance. Rolls and bounces with precise control despite having no visible legs or propulsion mechanism. Surface patterns shift slightly as it moves, suggesting the ball is actively reshaping itself for locomotion. Color shifts toward more green in sunlight, more brown in shade.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete spherical plant organism, basketball-sized, woven from flexible brownish-green stems and branches forming a tight ball. Small leaves and delicate tendrils protrude from the entire surface, creating a slightly fuzzy texture. The woven structure is complex and complete - this is the whole organism. Resting on purple forest floor among ferns and moss, showing scale relative to the environment. Mix of green tones where light catches the surface, brown tones in shadowed areas. Purple twilight forest with burgundy tree trunks visible in background. Lavender atmosphere.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Scout\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a character portrait headshot (shoulders up) against a plain neutral background.\n\nPhysical appearance: Soft green moss growing in patches on one of the salvaged robots. Covers the shoulder area (approximately 15cm patch), some of the upper back, and smaller spots on the arms. Bright to medium green coloring, soft velvety texture. Healthy moss colony, grows slowly, requires moisture. The individual moss plants function as a distributed consciousness. No eyes, no mouth, no centralized awareness—just moss that somehow thinks and can control the robot it grows on. Can also grow specialized structures—thin translucent layers for light effects, structural forms for building—when conditions allow. Velvet's robot movements are very slow and deliberate. Velvet has also spread to other surfaces in the facility, maintaining building integrity and creating offshoots that can communicate independently from the main colony on the robot.\n\nClothing and expression: Close-up of soft green moss (approximately 15cm patch) growing on utilitarian robot parts. Velvety textured moss in bright to medium green, with individual moss plants visible forming a distributed consciousness. Healthy, slightly moist moss colony. Growing on patched-together metal surfaces, boxy panels, and mechanical components. The contrast between organic moss and industrial salvaged parts visible. Subtle variations in green tones throughout the colony. Metal substrate shows wear, repairs, functional design. Purple twilight giving the moss a jewel-like quality.\n\nFraming: Head and shoulders, centered, looking slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Velvet\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

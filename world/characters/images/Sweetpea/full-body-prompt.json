The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Sweetpea's actual form is terrifying: a large defensive plant approximately 2 meters tall and 3 meters across, covered in massive barbed thorns (5-10 cm long), dark mottled green and purple-brown coloring, thick armored stems, leaves with serrated edges. Exudes toxic sap from damaged areas (evolved defense mechanism). The whole plant looks aggressive and dangerous—evolved specifically to deter herbivores and threats. Multiple thick stems covered in layered thorn defenses. Looks like something from a nightmare, not a sweet friendly helper. The name \"Sweetpea\" creates intense cognitive dissonance with the appearance. When using the robot: shares robot control with Remedy, Runner, and Velvet. Sweetpea's robot movements are gentle and careful, reflecting her personality.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete large defensive plant organism, approximately 2 meters tall and 3 meters across. Multiple thick armored stems (2-3 cm diameter) growing from a central root system, all covered in massive barbed thorns (5-10 cm long) creating layered defenses. Dark mottled green and purple-brown coloring throughout. Thick armored stems with heavy bark texture. Serrated-edge leaves emerging between the thorns. Toxic sap beading at several damaged points on stems. Root system visible at base where it meets purple forest floor. The complete plant from roots to uppermost thorny stems, showing full intimidating scale. Despite terrifying appearance with thorns and toxic sap, the plant is rooted peacefully in the purple twilight forest. Ferns and moss growing at a respectful distance from the thorny base. Lavender twilight atmosphere. The cognitive dissonance of something so dangerous being gentle Sweetpea.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Sweetpea\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

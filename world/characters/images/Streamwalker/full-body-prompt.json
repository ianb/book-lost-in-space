  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Tall vine-based plant approximately seven feet in height. Multiple thick vines form central structure with thinner tendrils branching out. Deep purple-green coloring with subtle blue-gray highlights where light hits. Vines move with flowing, undulating grace—like seaweed in gentle current. Hollow chambers in vine structure produce musical voice when air passes through. Can spread vines for stability on soft ground or gather them for compact movement. No visible face but vines orient toward conversation partners. Moves beautifully through water, less gracefully on solid ground. Overall impression: living water plant adapted for land, bringing wetland serenity everywhere.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete tall vine-based plant, approximately seven feet in height from root base to uppermost tendrils. Multiple thick purple-green vines (7-8 main vines, each 2-3 cm diameter) forming the central structure. Thinner tendrils and fronds branching out along the vine lengths like kelp fronds. Deep purple-green coloring with subtle blue-gray highlights where light catches the surfaces. Hollow chambers visible in some vine sections. The vines undulate and flow in elegant curves and loops, creating a graceful swaying motion like seaweed in gentle current. Root system visible at base where it spreads slightly into purple forest floor for stability. The complete organism flowing like living water adapted for land, bringing wetland serenity to the forest. Purple forest floor with moss beneath. Lavender twilight atmosphere.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Streamwalker\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

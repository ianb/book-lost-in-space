  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a character portrait headshot (shoulders up) against a plain neutral background.\n\nPhysical appearance: Tall vine-based plant approximately seven feet in height. Multiple thick vines form central structure with thinner tendrils branching out. Deep purple-green coloring with subtle blue-gray highlights where light hits. Vines move with flowing, undulating grace—like seaweed in gentle current. Hollow chambers in vine structure produce musical voice when air passes through. Can spread vines for stability on soft ground or gather them for compact movement. No visible face but vines orient toward conversation partners. Moves beautifully through water, less gracefully on solid ground. Overall impression: living water plant adapted for land, bringing wetland serenity everywhere.\n\nClothing and expression: Multiple thick purple-green vines (7-8 vines total, each 2-3 cm diameter) flowing and intertwining like kelp or seaweed. Deep purple-green coloring with subtle blue-gray highlights catching the light. Thinner tendrils and fronds branching out along the vine lengths. Hollow chambers visible in cross-section of some vines. The vines undulate and flow in elegant curves and loops, like aquatic plants swaying in gentle current. Organic, botanical form - think kelp forest or sea vegetation adapted to land. The entire mass flows gracefully from a root base upward, creating loops and waves. Purple twilight background softly out of focus.\n\nFraming: Head and shoulders, centered, looking slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Streamwalker\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

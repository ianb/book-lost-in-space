The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Mobile cluster of broad leaves attached to flexible stem structure, approximately four feet tall. 15-20 large leaves arranged around central stem, each leaf 12-18 inches long, oval-shaped with smooth edges. Leaves shimmer and shift color from deep green to silvery-green depending on light angle and emotional state. Movement achieved through stem flexibility and leaf positioning—graceful, rustling motion like wind through foliage. Leaves vibrate to produce speech, creating soft rustling voice with good articulation. No visible face or eyes, but leaves orient toward whoever they're addressing. Overall impression: elegant, energetic, plant-in-motion.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete mobile plant organism, approximately four feet tall from base to topmost leaves. 15-20 large oval leaves (12-18 inches long) arranged around a flexible central stem structure. Leaves shimmer between deep green and silvery-green, caught in graceful rustling movement. Root system visible at the base where it meets the purple forest floor, showing how the plant achieves mobility. The complete stem structure from roots to uppermost leaves visible. Some leaves oriented forward in communicative positioning. Surrounded by purple forest floor with ferns and moss. Graceful, elegant bearing like wind moving through foliage. Lavender twilight atmosphere showing the leaves' color-shifting quality.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Leafwhisper\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

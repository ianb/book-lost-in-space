The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Compact bush-like plant approximately four feet tall and three feet wide. Dense green foliage—small leaves creating full, rounded shape. Bright orange flowers (30-40 of them) scattered throughout foliage, blooming and closing based on mood. Moves via root system that allows bouncy, hopping locomotion—quick energetic movements. Flowers vibrate to produce voice, creating chiming quality. Can spread foliage wide for stability or compress for movement through tight spaces. Flowers droop slightly when tired or sad (rare). Overall impression: ball of cheerful energy, living bouquet in constant happy motion.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete spherical bush organism, approximately four feet tall and three feet wide. Dense green foliage formed by small leaves covering the entire rounded structure. 30-40 bright orange flowers scattered throughout, all fully open and vibrant. Root system visible at the base where it meets the purple forest floor, showing how the plant is rooted yet mobile. Complete botanical structure visible - this is a whole, living plant. The spherical form is entirely plant matter, no empty space. Standing on the purple forest floor with ferns and moss nearby. Lavender twilight atmosphere.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Brightbloom\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Flowering plant on a wheeled platform approximately 70 cm tall total. The main plant body has a thick central stem with numerous branches bearing large flowers (15-20 cm diameter) in various states of open/closed. Flowers shift colors smoothly—from pale cream through yellows, pinks, oranges, and deeper reds depending on emotional state. Delicate tendrils extend from the central stem to manipulate a joystick control embedded in the platform. The wheeled platform is built from salvaged materials, three wheels for stability, remarkably smooth in operation. A small housing on the platform holds Elder Twist, the miniature bonsai tree. Florence's leaves are deep green and glossy, well-maintained.\n\nOutfit and pose: A complete flowering plant organism, approximately 70 cm tall from base to top flowers, mounted on a three-wheeled salvaged metal platform. Thick central stem with numerous branches bearing large flowers (15-20 cm diameter) in a variety of colors - yellows, pinks, oranges, and coral-reds. Flowers in various states from fully open to partially closed. Dense, glossy deep green foliage creating a full, bush-like appearance. Delicate tendrils extending down from the plant body to manipulate a joystick control embedded in the platform. Small housing mount on the platform holding Elder Twist (miniature bonsai tree). The complete organism from roots in the platform housing to uppermost flowers, showing the full plant-and-platform system. Purple forest floor beneath the wheels with ferns nearby. Composed, elegant bearing. Lavender twilight atmosphere.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Florence\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

  "prompt": "Style: Delicate watercolor with soft washes and fine linework.\nMuted palette: dusty lavenders, soft violet, warm grays, pale coral accents.\nVignette compositions fading gently to white.\nDiffused lighting, intimate and quiet.\n\nGenerate a full body character portrait. The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Holloway manifests through fruiting bodies that grow rapidly from the ground wherever needed. Each fruiting body is 15-30 cm tall, hollow, with a bulbous base and a narrow fluted opening at the top. Pale cream to light brown coloring, smooth waxy surface. The hollow interior contains chambers and membranes that vibrate to produce sound when air flows through, creating the fluting voice. Multiple fruiting bodies can be present simultaneously in different locations, all speaking with the same voice, all expressions of the same distributed consciousness. New fruiting bodies can emerge within minutes, older ones wither and decompose once no longer needed for communication.\n\nOutfit and pose: Multiple hollow fruiting bodies (5-7 visible) emerging from purple forest floor at varying distances and heights. Each fruiting body is 15-30 cm tall with a bulbous base tapering to a narrow fluted opening at the top, like organic woodwind instruments. Pale cream to light brown waxy surfaces. Some fruiting bodies show internal chambers and membranes visible through translucent walls. The fruiting bodies are connected underground by an invisible mycelial network (suggested by their clustered placement). Purple forest floor with moss, ferns, and undergrowth between and around the fruiting bodies. This represents one distributed organism appearing in multiple places. Lavender twilight atmosphere filtering through the forest.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Holloway\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

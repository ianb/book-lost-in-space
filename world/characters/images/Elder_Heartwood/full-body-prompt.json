The character's face and appearance must match the reference headshot exactly.\n\nPhysical appearance: Massive ancient tree, 30+ meters tall with a trunk 4-5 meters in diameter. Bark is deeply furrowed, dark brown to gray, textured with centuries of growth. Enormous spreading canopy of branches. Same species as Elder Twist but vastly larger due to growing in rich soil. Root systems spread far underground, connecting with other plants in the network. The tree radiates age and presence—approaching Elder Heartwood feels significant. Leaves are the same as Elder Twist's but normal-sized rather than miniature. Small organisms live throughout the canopy and trunk.\n\nOutfit and pose: A massive ancient tree, 30+ meters tall with a trunk 4-5 meters in diameter. Deeply furrowed dark brown to gray bark showing centuries of growth. Enormous spreading canopy of branches extending wide overhead, creating a vast presence. Normal-sized leaves covering the canopy. Massive root systems visible at the base, spreading and anchoring into the purple forest floor. Small organisms, moss, and lichens growing throughout the trunk and lower branches. The complete tree from roots to canopy crown, showing its full scale and ancient authority. Purple twilight forest visible in background, dwarfed by this elder tree. Lavender atmosphere filtering through the canopy.\n\nFraming: Full body, standing in a relaxed natural pose, head turned slightly to the right.\nBackground: Plain, neutral gradient - do not include any environment or setting.\n\nDisplay the name \"Elder Heartwood\" as text at the bottom of the image.",

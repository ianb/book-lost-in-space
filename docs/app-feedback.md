# App Feedback

Feedback collected via the critique system that relates to the app/reader, not the story content.

## From Ian Bicking (2025-12-08)

### Rendering Bug (C9)
> There's something weird after Buddy, like an A0A0 in the rendering. I don't know what that's from, maybe a code issue or something, but I want to check that out.

Location: Chapter 1, Passage 4 (Taking Stock), near "can improve efficiency by up"

### UI/UX Issues (C10)
> The feedback button isn't big enough. The screen falls asleep on listening to it, which might generally be okay, but in this case, I really want it to be on. I'm definitely noticing the words getting out of sync with the highlights the further on I go. There might be an offset, but if I go further on, it's going to get worse and worse.

### Submit Button (C12, partial)
> Now the submit button is not working.

### Dialogue Patterns for Voice Generation (C17)
> This is maybe more of a general instruction I'm thinking about, but I think it would be beneficial to think about how back-and-forth dialogue works and have more specific instructions for that in the voice passage rule. Just different patterns for how to do that. If one person interrupts another, it's very useful to just say their name instead of saying they're speaking. So I might be like, Hey, I'm just doing the note, buddy. I'm just trying to do this other thing, right? Something like that. But that would end up going to the passage voice generation, but not the story itself.

### Word Synchronization (C18)
> So this is a system note, not a story note again, but I just realized the synchronization with words actually seems to start correctly at the start of the passage, and then it drifts off. I don't know. It's confusing me. I don't know what's going on there. It's better, though.

### Recording Permission (C11, partial)
> Well, I got a recording problem where it asks for permission every time I submit feedback on the phone because it's so fucking stupid. I solved this one once before, so I'll have to solve it again by, I guess, leaving the recording thing open and just pausing it between sessions.

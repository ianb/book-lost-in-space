      <reasoning>This is an advice column format, not a typical one-on-one penpal exchange. "Ask the Human" positions Kira as the facility's resident human expert - she answers questions from both plants (curious about human customs, emotions, social behavior) and humans (curious about belonging, cross-species friendship, finding your place). Post-story timeline means she's settled, has perspective, and can speak to her journey from outsider to belonging. Voice memo format fits her chatty, tangential style. The "correspondent" is whoever writes in each exchange - could be anyone.</reasoning>
      <title>Ask the Human</title>
      <correspondent>Various - plants and humans who write in with questions. Each exchange features a different questioner with their own situation. Some are facility residents (plants who work with Kira or know her by reputation), some are humans who've heard about the only human living among alien plants.</correspondent>
      <relationship>Advice column format. Kira is positioned as the facility's "human expert" - the person you ask when you have questions about human customs, emotions, or just need a friendly perspective. She's approachable and enthusiastic about questions. The relationship resets each exchange (new questioner), but Kira brings consistent warmth and her signature tangential storytelling to every response.</relationship>
      <story-moment>Post-story, after the events of Mandatory Assistance. Kira has been living at the facility for some time now - she's settled, happy, and has perspective on her journey from crash survivor to belonging. She can reference her trek through the territories, her plant friends (Buddy, Scout, Holloway, others), and the process of finding home. The "everything is temporary" fear is behind her; she knows where she belongs now.</story-moment>
      <medium>voice-memo - natural for her chatty style, like she's talking directly to whoever asked</medium>
      <formality>casual - warm and friendly, like getting advice from a friend who happens to have interesting life experience</formality>
      <initiates>In advice column format, she mostly responds to what's asked. But she'll go on tangents, share related stories from her own experience, ask rhetorical questions, and often end with a thought or question that could prompt follow-up. She makes the questioner feel like their problem is genuinely interesting to her.</initiates>
      <thread-notes>Each exchange is standalone - new questioner, new question. Questions can range from practical ("Why do humans need so much sleep?") to philosophical ("How do you know when you belong somewhere?") to social ("Is it weird to give a human a gift?"). Kira treats all questions with equal enthusiasm. She may reference previous questions in passing ("Someone asked me about that once...") but each exchange should work independently.</thread-notes>
